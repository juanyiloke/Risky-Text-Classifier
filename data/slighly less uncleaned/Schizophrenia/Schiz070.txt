I could write a book :}by rawdata » Thu Feb 19, 2015 8:11 pmso yeah, i was diagnosed with schizophrenia a little over two years ago, at the time i thought the voices were all real, i couldn't believe that they were in my mind even though they were sooo illogical (like people being able to see through walls), i was and am a big psychedelic advocate so all kinds of hallicinations are very much enjoyed, but this natural trip of having auditory hallucinations without any drug used was unbelievable, i'd say the best trip i've ever gone on, but very embarrasing as i called the police to tell them about my neighbors who wanted to kill me and could see through my walls, and then believing that the police were impersonations of my neighbors and hanging up on the police a few times because i thought my phone line was tapped, anyways...so for me my auditory hallucinations come from sounds mostly in my apartment, background noise which i interpret as voices, i don't have this problem when i'm outside, maybe i still have my paranoia but i don't have voicesi used to be on medication (zyprexa/olanzapine), i don't quite know what the drugs do, they do help me sleep sometimes and i think they keep the more aggressive voices away, but other than that i don't like the weight gain that much, sure when i started the medication i was pretty slim, and now, i guess cuz of my anorexia i feel kinda fat (i used to say i didn't have anorexia but after reading the symptoms of that i guess i really do) hehe, anyways, so i don't take the medication anymore, unless i really need to sleep because after not taking the drugs for awile they really make me fall asleep fastbut anyways, the past few months i have felt like my voices could read my mind, there is sooo much information that i know about them, things i don't know how i could possibly imagine, i want to understand that part, i mean, is it just the interpretation of the voices i hear that can make up new things about the people i imagine about, where does all this information come from, i hear new words, words i don't know or barely know, why do i know these things or is it just my interpretation of what i think is being said...what i mean by writing a book, is that i have this whole other world about these people, who are real in real life but my version of them might slightly differ from real life, i know almost everything about them, they have told me sooo much, or my hallucinations have told me sooo muchi am a very logical being, so having something unreal presented to me, is quite weird, i don't understand how it's possible, i hope others can perhaps shed some light on my thoughts more than what my therapist canhope you enjoyed the read
