Insane, it is. Meds we on, with more severe side-effects than any "illegal" drug ever found/made. We get with tax-money to make us, less schizophrene. Cos the drugs be made with profit in sight. As with illegal drugs. Still, illegal drugs=better highs, less sideeffects, and, in reality, cheaper for everybody. I think this ???????? is made up, so as not let us do what our instincts tell us to do. The stigma is insane. Nobody want ANYTHING to do with a schizophrenic individual. We are lab-rats. We are jews. We are unter-mensch.
