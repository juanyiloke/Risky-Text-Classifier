I've seen so many paranormal things it's not even funny, they all have explanations and everything but you'd call them paranormal still. I've seen other beings, what they used to call gods, spirits, ghosts, magic, aliens, a freaking ufo to. I've the seen the future, i've had beings induce nde type experiences in my mind, so so much. Sounds alot like a shamanic spirit walk or something. James randi is offering one million dollars for anyone that can PROVE it! Have to have that proof you know. It sucks, i could have one million dollars but that is what they have done to me. They showed me alot of stuff and won't show anyone else and won't let me prove it to randi whatsoever. Im like hey im seeing the interdimensional beings that shaman have always seen, can i have the million? But no, i can't have the million can i, oh no i can't. My torture filled life eh? Ill be out there and they'll shock me and burn me, once they even bent my spine. Everyone is like "nah you aren't actually feeling pain when that stuff happens, trust us we have science now, we know." Perhaps randi is there to perhaps steer folks in a certain direction perhaps? Who knows right? Because someone would have taken the million if anything near it were real right? My torment.
