ÊPeople watching you???Does anyone else feel like people are constantly watching you?For as long as I can remember I have always felt as though people are watching me- it doesn't matter where I am or what I'm doing their always there. I find I cover web cams, mirrors and anything shiny. I can't leave my curtains open cause I feel like I'm being watched. I even feel as though people can see me through walls.I don't know why I feel like this- sometimes it is better than other times but it is always there. My T says its a fear that I need to let go of, but it doesn't feel like a fear to me, it feels real like I am apart of some sort of experiment where people are trying to discover the real me- the bad one. I haven't yet found anywhere that I feel free from this, I'm not even sure if a place exists- but I have to keep protecting myself cause it's not safe if I don't.
