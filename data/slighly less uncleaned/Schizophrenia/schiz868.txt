I was misdiagnosed as ADD when I was 6 up till the age of 16ish... I am 23 and have been getting help since then (16ish). my schizophrenia I think was passed down by my paternal grandpa (don't know anything abut him other then this) and I was born with it. it would explain everything that was going on. that's the prelude to my 1st question. 1st ?... ultimately is can anyone tell me an "estimate" on how much of my brain is now "gone"? I was given riddlin the time of 6-16ish. about 500mg a day. 90mg to start. 2nd ?... I'm medicated 600mg Seroquel XR, with it I have "delusions" (or paranoid/whatever) I have "spells" of this occasionally. I can tell the difference between reality and the delusion AFTER its said and done. (prelude for question) Now the ?, how can I develop the ability to PREVENT or at least know I'm having one in the before range? the voices and suicidal stuff I have control of. the delusions have almost cost me my job many times. just wounding. I Thank you before hand anyone who can help me.
