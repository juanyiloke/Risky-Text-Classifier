Êrecovery planshow are your goals for recovery coming along? what are you trying to improve in your life? what have been some stumbling blocks in your path? i think we can all recover to some degree. personally what ive done for recovery is quitting drinking, ive been pretty much symptom free since then. i also signed up for vocational training to be a certified nurses assistant, its only 45 days long so i dont think it will be too bad. my end goal is to get off disability, renew my emt license, and work in emergency medicine. i dont think my illness will stop me but i have a hell of self doubt stemming from my time being psychotic and unable to do a lot of stuff, have any of you dealt with that?
