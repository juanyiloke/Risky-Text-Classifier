I feel like I've lost my ego... can anyone relate?by XxTheCrowXx » Sun Mar 01, 2015 7:10 pmI don't know how else to explain it, I feel like a big part of me has died. I've lost the ability to establish and express myself as a person, at least in my mind I have. The "I" that I thought I knew holds no meaning anymore, neither do the people around me. Some days I wake up, and I don't know who I am, where I am, or even what I am. It's like there is no me, there is only all and I am a part of that all and nothing more. What I see around me are these strange faces and fake emotions, and I can do nothing but feed off the overwhelming energy they give off, which leaves me emotionally numb. The biggest thing that puzzles me is, how does one get out of this? I honestly have no recollection of how I was before any of this happened, it's like this is the only existence I know of and anything else seems strange. It's hard for me to talk to therapists about this because I really have no basis of comparison. I guess the reason I posted this was to see if maybe anyone else has felt this way?
