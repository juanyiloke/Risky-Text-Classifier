Two types of anti-psychotic medication?Dear all,Following my recent experience of hearing a single voice my mental health team has decided to put me on a small dose of Risperidone. This is in addition to Abilify at 20mg. However, before this step is instigated the team will increase my Abilify to 25mg to see if this removes the voice. To be honest I am very anxious regarding the whole thing. I would be very interested in anyone that has increased their Abilify to counter auditory hallucinations. I would also be intrigued by anyone that has been put on two types of anti=psychotic meds. Did this regime prove effective?Any help would be greatly appreciatedMorrissey30
