ÊAcceptance of lifelong condition, diagnosis & medicationHi all.Êi have a long history of mental health experiences/difficulties.ÊThings have reached a stage where it seems largely easier to accept the realities of the diagnosis & medication dependency, & to accept that will very likely be a lifelong thing.Êi have fought so hard to try & find a fuller healing & recovery to things, but am left with certain realities to my life & circumstances.Êi've found it very difficult over the years to more fully accept the orthodox psychiatry/medical view on things. But what realistic choices are there to approach things in a radically different way? i stopped all medication 5 times over the years, always landing back in severe states of illness.Êi've been T-Total over 13 years, & have sought out the assistance of all kinds of healers & alternative avenues of recovery & healing - But am left still with certain difficulties & still on the medication. It has been very hard to find a more comprehensive understanding & support for everything.ÊHow many of you here accept that you'll likely never resolve things & that you'll have the condition, diagnosis & medication for life?It saddens me a bit - i think so much more could have been done to help me with things.
