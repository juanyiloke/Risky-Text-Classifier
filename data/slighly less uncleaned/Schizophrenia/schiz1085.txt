ÊRisperidone = brain deathI have been on Risperdal now for 1 year for my Sz negative symptoms and have noticed about a week ago that the wheels in my brain that was constantly moving have stopped, it;s like a vege state of mind has occurred!?i feel burned out, am trying to recover but my communication levels have dropped and am feeling depressed.I will see my shrink in a month and maybe get on abilify, before i was very active in speech but its like everything has died.Have difficulty in recalling and maintaining communication, dont feel like talking to anyone because the expansion of my personality has apparently shrunk, maybe a neuro-cognitive stimulant is what i need, would appreciate any feedback from anyone. thanks..BTW prior to this happening i was on Piracetam 3 times a day 1 tablet and Somazina 1000mg once a day which are nootropics.The irony!!!am now on Gingko Biloba to try and recover or maybe it was that cheap **** coffee i bought for 2 euros1 month of that who knows?!
