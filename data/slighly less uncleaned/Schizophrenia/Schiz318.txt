Objectively, I would never have wanted to be schizophrenic at any point in my 35 years with it. BUT... I remember some of the experiences I had while having it were "interesting". That's about as positive as I can get about it. I would not like to have any of those "interesting" experiences again and I certainly do not miss them. I could have done just fine in my life without any those experiences. I could be happy never having had them in the first place.Maybe some people enjoy schizophrenia in the small picture or they enjoy some of the the small details but in the big picture if you look at your overall experience with schizophrenia I don't think anyone would really want it. Ask anyone who has had schizophrenia for more than 3-5 years if they have enjoyed having had it. You don't need a poll to see that most people would rather never have had it.
