ÊCross RoadsI am at a serious cross roads and I have to make a choice. I have been putting off this choice for many years. Essentially, the choice is to either no longer participate in mental health forums or chat rooms or completely change the way I interact in such environments.ÊI am at a level of intellectual knowledge in my understanding of psychosis and mental health in general that is far from the mainstream. When I attempt to put in writing or vocalize what I know, I am met with nothing but opposition and arguments. It has caused me to do one of two things: 1) Press the evidence even further 2) Back down to avoid stress and conflict -- often it is number 2. Something has got change.
