Fear induced by antipsychotic medicationI've written about this issue many times on this board but here it goes again.When I take an antipsychotic med like zyprexa I get the following symptoms which are quite distressing:The most worrying symptom for me is fear. I get scared and paranoid and this happens two or three times a week and each often lasts for five hours.Anyone else got this fear from an antipsychotic med? I'm taking 7.5mg resperidone consta depot injection plus 15mg zyprexa zydis.
