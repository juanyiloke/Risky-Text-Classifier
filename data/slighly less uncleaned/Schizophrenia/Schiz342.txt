I'm on risperidone injections once every 2 weeks. I've been on it for about 10ish months. About a couple months ago I started noticing I hiccuped a few times in the day. Nothing too irritating but someone told me that hiccups is a sign of brain cancer!? So I had a look for side effects of my medication again and all I could come across in regards to hiccups from my medication was someone on a forum who said they were hiccuping as well, but it was more persistent then say 6-10 times a day which is what I'm experiencing.Any of you guys get hiccups without a cause such as from drinking something? Do you know if it's a side effects from your meds?I think it's just a late side effect of my medication but I don't know for sure, it's been bothering me.
