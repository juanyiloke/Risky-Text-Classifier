ÊSeverity, frequency, and duration of psychotic episodes on and off medication?I've been having some difficulties lately. I started treatment in August and had to go through I think three different medications before I found one, Geodon, that worked for me. I thought it had gotten rid of the psychotic symptoms entirely but a couple of months ago I had an episode that lasted a few hours. Happened again last week and it lasted for a couple of days. I asked about it on a support forum and got mixed responses. Some people said it was normal to experience the occasional psychotic episode while on medication, some people said I need to adjust my medication. I'm obviously going to bring this up with my pdoc the next time I get the chance but I wanted to get some more opinions in the meantime, especially because it's different for everyone.How often did you have psychotic episodes before being treated? How bad did they get and how long did they last? What about after 'successful' treatment?
