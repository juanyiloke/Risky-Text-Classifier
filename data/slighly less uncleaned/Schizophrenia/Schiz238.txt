Does anyone else get really bad nausea randomly? I usually get nauseated when my symptoms flare up. But I don't know the official source.I can't tell if it's from something I ate or if it's from anxiety usually. I don't like how I can't tell what the nausea is officially from. It usually happens around the time I start feeling odd from symptoms and just goes away and comes back randomly.Right now I just ate some carneasada fries (awesome Mexican food), and I can't tell if the nausea is from my symptoms or the food. I feel like someone/thing is scrambling my brain and keep getting random thoughts of people around me laughing or talking in the dark (in my head, like very vivid intrusive thoughts, not hallucinations) and I can't hold crap in my head right now. And, I don't know why, but I'm trembling. This is not very typical of my symptoms though, except the thought blocking. The last time I felt like this was when I took a few too many puffs of spice (a weed synthetic) a few years ago and lost my ????.Do you think it's possible the Mexican food place put weed or something in my food? Like maybe to get people to come back or something? That's exactly what it feels like. Though I'm trying not to be paranoid.
