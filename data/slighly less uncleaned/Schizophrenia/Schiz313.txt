So as this is my first post on here I firstly just want to say hi, and hope everyone is doing guuud! Normally speaking, talking about myself is not something I like to do (haha) as It feels selfish, but I have yet to talk to anyone else that also suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Currently I have been taking medication for a number of years, Quetiapine @ 600mg. Is o.k. apart from the time it takes to get up, even after so long, although I can't complain as it is its only negative I feel. Generally, I seem to have more visual hallucinations compared to audio. Not always nice if I'm totally honest, but you do get used to it some what.Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys and gals a question. If you were diagnosd with paranoid schizophrenia, at that time of diagnosis how did that make you feel? Was there a part of you that rejected it? I only ask as I found it very difficult to accept. I remeber coming home feeling I let poeple down, also I found myself thinking my life was never going to be the same.But I hope you all enjoy your evening even if it is 1:30am hahasleep well my friends
