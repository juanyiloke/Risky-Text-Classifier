ÊDo any of you feel weird talking to others with schizophrenia?Before I found this forum, I didn't have anyone to talk to about it who actually knew what I was going through but the more and more I post, the more I get paranoid that everyone is decoys and it's part of a conspiracy to make me feel like I'm not alone when in reality, they're trying to break me and get me to kill myself so they don't have to.ÊI've played this post out in my head many times and I know what responses I'll get but I feel like they're all programmed responses to try to maintain the illusion that I'm not alone. But I don't think they know I would see through their plot.
