Êenlightenment and psychosishas anyone else felt enlightened but it was actually psychosis? My latuda is helping a lot with the chaos in my head and things are starting to look positive but i'm scared it's actually just another psychotic episode. Marijuana makes things way different for me. before i had my first psychotic episode (maybe im still in it) marijuana affected me diffferently. Now i have hallucinated visually while on it. But today i smoked and had this enlightenment. I've believed that life is warfare. In every way there is warfare going on and i am at war with myself. I have a demon who is implanted in my head but i also have an alternate person, my psych thinks its just me confusing my own thoughts as someone elses, but there is a person who is an entity outside of me but also is part of me. it can speak through me and it is very holy but like weird too. Maybe my psychosis is just turning into a positive experience because i learned i just have to keep fighting and accept myself because iti s hard to be accepted as i currently am. I dont know where im going with this but i feel like i have so much extra knowledge and then with marijuana it just enhances it all. i wrote down a list f all the things i learned today. im trying to stay positive. please i dont know what the point of this post is but does anyone relate?
