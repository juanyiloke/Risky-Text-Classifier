Êschizophreniac patient should I shift to US from India to join a software firmI plan to shift to US from India and would be joining a software firm. Problem is that I suffer from schizophrenia and I am worried if my employers become aware of this illness of mine what would be their reaction. As far as I understood the health insurance would be linked to my company so if I visit a psychiatrist my company may become aware about it. Do I need to worry about things like lay off. Please advise and suggest.
