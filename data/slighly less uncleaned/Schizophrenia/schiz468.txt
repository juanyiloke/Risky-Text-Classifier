ÊChanging meds again Treatment resistantSo after a lot of discussion I am now taking a depot of haldol 100mg every 2 weeks. I have now tried nearly every drug available from Abilify to Zuclopentixol and nothing really works. I have been told that I am treatment resistant and I must go on clozapine but after a blood test I was found to have a low white count due to me taking zuclopentixol so they will not persue the clozapine as they expect a similar reaction.I am running out of patience. The voices talk to me daily telling me how to kill myself and that I am evil and that I work for the devil. It upsets me because I have never to my knowledge ever been evil. I have never had a fight, I have never hurt anyone but on and on "Your evil you have evil blood. You work for me I own you, Do as I say"My poor wife puts up with this crap day after day she is there for me and I am now a total waste of space as I no longer work I do nothing around the house to help her and I am constantly irratable. Hopefully the haldol will help a little I just need to get out of this hole that I have dug for myself whilst trying to hide from the voices
