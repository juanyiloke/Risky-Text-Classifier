you can never count all the stars at night or the people that live around the stars in the night there are so many so far away we are family is here todayand we have been born with every color of the rainbow in skin would you be prejudiced again.or born with more arms and legs.would you still be calling me a freak again.what is my eyes could see colors you couldn't see or maybe I could hear more than the.would you still be embarrassed by me.and what happens when nature goes astray you treat us like animals and slaves. so there's nothing human about you now.when everything is manifested somehow. The end.
