ÊHow do you cope with avolition?Lack of motivation (avolition) is a common negative symptom. How do you deal with it and get around it? It is really making it hard for me to get anything done, and lead a life worth living. I want to write, and study languages, and travel, and make money, and fall in love, and learn to cook...but I can't find the motivation to do any of that. I could easily spend all day online (and then hate myself at the end of the day when I realize that nothing was accomplished).ÊI've tried making schedules and using timers, and they help a little. Habit also helps too; I take a shower everyday before I go to bed, and it is automatic. Thus, my hygiene is pretty good.Any other tips? I think it is probably impossible for us to overcome this, but maybe we can brainstorm and find ways to be slightly more effective.Thanks!
