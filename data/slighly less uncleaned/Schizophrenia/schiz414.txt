 holidayi had the vomiting/stomach bug 4 weeks ago and had to stop my meds as i couldnt keep them down....i was vomiting for over a week and my voices came back especially the one i hadnt heard for over 12months...now this voice is telling me that the meds are poison...although th vomiting bug has stopped after a week i still have a stomach bug 4 weeks on (went back the doctor and she said to go back in 2 weeks if i am not better!! i have had it 4 weeks up to now and i have lost a considerate amount of weight!)i have been without meds now for 4 weeks and the voices are really loud especially this particular voice whos demanding me to hurt myself or someone elsemy nurse has been coming to my flat twice a week and texting me too and hes asking me to see the psychiatrist but i am refusing because i dont trust them.....he wanted to put me on a step up care plan and i refused this too as i dont want different people coming to my flat everday, so he said he would make an appointment for me to see the psychiatrist in 3 weeks (waiting time to see one) but he did say that he has a duty of care and that if he comes to see me next week and sees that i am no better he will bring the psychiatrist on the next visit...he has been asking me to try to take my meds but i am refusing because they are poisonthis easter break is killing me with no one to talk to, i cant talk to my family as i am trying to hide the fact i am struggling and besides i dont trust themmy close cousin has noticed a change in me and i have denied that i am unwellthe nurse was supposed to ring me on thursday and he didnt...maybe he was called out on an emergency which i understand my close cousin had been asking me for two whole weeks to go on holiday with her and after thr nurse not ringing i thought f**k the lot of them i am going on holidayi just need to get away from everyone and everything i am not unwell just running on adrenaline at the moment as i am not sleeping/not eating / drinking much neither as they are poison...anything i eat and drink goes through me right after and i cant handle that anymorei am dreading the nurse ringing/texting/coming to my flat as i dont know how to tell him that i have booked a holiday for 3 weeks timemy question is can they stop me from going on holiday? as nurse suggested hospital and i said no i dont want to go into hospital....i am ok but he doesnt believe me
