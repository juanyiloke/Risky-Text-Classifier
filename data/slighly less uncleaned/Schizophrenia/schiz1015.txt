when do i go to the hospitalI have a permanent migraine due to pinched occipital nerves but I also get cluster migraines and most importantly I have three aneurism and 1 additional one that was clipped and coiled the problem is that the symptoms mirror each other so we are never sure when we should go there have been many times we went for nothing and a few times we didn't go and I had been having yet another hemorrhagic stroke all together I have had around 18 of those. today for example my head feels like my brain is on fire my morphine didn't touch the pain nor has the anti-inflammatory I take for them bp is 130/96 blood sugar 100 vision very very blurry. problem is I have had these symptoms when I was having a stroke and I have had them when I was not having a stroke but rather a headache spike. so how do you know when to go the drs just say always go because they are worried about a lawsuit if I died and hadn't gone based on their advice but it leaves us never knowing what to do
