ÊPsychosisHi,Beginning of 2013 I had a pyschotic episode and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The police were there as well. I would not go in the ambulance as I was afraid the ambulance people and police were going to hurt me. I didn't believe the police were the police or the ambulance people. I thought they were someone else pretending to be police and ambulance that were going to hurt me. Going in that ambulance was a pretty scary experience for me as i had never been in an ambulance before. I don't know what has caused this illness. I've never done illicit drugs and never will, so it cannot be that. Also no one else in my family has it so it can't be genetics. I am currently on paliperidone (however you spell it). I'm also starting a new medication next year along with the paliperidone. The good thing is i don't have the thoughts that my mum is someone else like i had been thinking. Having delusional thoughts that she is someone else. I actually believe she is her now. I still have some delusional thoughts I get suspicious of people sometimes, overally suspicous, thinking their going to harm me etc. Some of that has gone too but I still find it hard to watch tv as i have •deas of reference"think the tv with what it talks about is refering to me. Anyway, i am better than what i was but i find it hard to cope alot of the time. Does anyone out there who has psychosis feel that way too? finds it hard to cope alot of the time and just don't feel like you want to be here? Or you feel like running away sometimes? Running away won't get rid of it. My mum knows a few people with this illness and as they got older it became dormant and the symptoms went away. So to those who don't think you won't get better, there is hope.ÊThanks.Terri
