 Seeing things w/o being schizophrenic?For quite some time I have seen things out of the corner of my eyes. I have floaters, which I know can affect this. I also wear glasses and when I forget I'm wearing them, the rims look like something, but of course aren't.What alarmed me is when I saw a drop of blood that wasn't there. I was expecting to see it, which I know can make your eyes play tricks on you. At first it looked like it was there, but wasn't. This has never happened. I have been in and out of therapists offices for OCD and depression, and I have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia or anything that causes delusions.I don't see people or hear things. I think the problem may be that I get scared of seeing things, and when I expect to see them, my eyes play tricks on me. I also read that this problem can be caused by mental stress, which I do have a lot of. Can anyone relate to this? If so, please tell me. It would be nice to know that I'm not alone. Thank you.P.S.I'm sorry for posting this twice. I wasn't sure where to put it and I was upset at the time, so I put it in Mental Health. I tried to delete it, but obviously you can't. Sorry for the annoyance. I just need help.
