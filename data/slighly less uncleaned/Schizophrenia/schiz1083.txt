Has anyone taken LutadaHas anyone taken lutada, it's the newest anti-psychotic on the market. I was previously on zyprexa and geodon, but I felt so so nervous on those!! I had crying spells of being fear and nervous about really nothing.So I am glad I am now on lutada, but only for a week now. Has anyone been able to tolerate this med? after long use? I am afraid of having nervous eposiodes after a month of taking this, like I did the other meds. After this , there is nothing really left for me to try, I've about tried all the meds and couldn't stand the miserable side effects!
