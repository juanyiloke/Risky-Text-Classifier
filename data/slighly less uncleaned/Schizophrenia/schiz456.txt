ÊWanting to get off my medsI've been on Saphris 5mg every night for about 2-3 years. I was diagnosed as having undifferentiated schizophrenia. I don't really hear voices or hallucinate at all. I think I could have been misdiagnosed. I know it does happen. I do have unreasonable thoughts from time to time like everyone is out to get me and make me suffer. I wouldn't call that unbearable. The main thing I'm worried about is withdrawal from Saphris when I do go off it. I've seen literature that says there are no major withdrawal symptoms but I've also seen posts where a lot of people get insomnia and anxiety. I could live with the anxiety if there is some but living with insomnia could be unbearable if it lasted for weeks. I've already started tapering down a little. So far no major withdrawal symptoms. I haven't told my psychiatrist that I'm doing this. I just don't want to be dependent on Saphris my whole life. I don't think sleep should be that much affected when going off Saphris. From my understanding it mostly effects dopamine receptors and doesn't really affect the chemicals involved in sleep.
