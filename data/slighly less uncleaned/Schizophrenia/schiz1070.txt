 Does it have to be linked to my mental illness?I have paranoid schizophrenia.When I was first diagnosed, I thought that all my symptoms were due to the schizophrenia. A few years later I talked to allot of other schizophrenics online and noticed that some of what I was experiencing was not shared by any other schizophrenic. I know the disease differs allot between people, so I am not sure what to think.I am a pathological liar. The kind that does so not wish to gain anything by it, or start to believe the lies themselves. I do it for the sole pleasure of deceiving people and getting away with it. No other reason.I have absolutely no conscience. I have done terrible things and never felt bad or anything about it. I make jokes of people that died or suffers. ( I almost got punched once for laughing at a friend who said he lost a close friend to cancer and that he misses him ). My dad died literally in front of me more than a year back. I just stood there. No happy, no sad. NothingI love seeing people suffer. Physically and emotionally.Of what I know now, these are not linked to my illness. A close friend who suffers from schizoaffective disorder, said that I may have psychopathy in addition to schizophrenia. I did allot of research on this and find that there are similar trades, but more differences in me ( No charm, self-worth, need for stimulation. I don't have the lack of delusions symptom either( I have quite a few delusions regularly) . I also have basically no sex-drive ).Can't I just be a "morbid", "sick" or "deranged" person, without it being linked to some kind of mental illness?Some answers would be really helpful .
