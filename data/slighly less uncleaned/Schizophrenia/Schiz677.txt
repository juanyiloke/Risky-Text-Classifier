ÊThinking my way out of anxietyHello guys... I am extremely shy and anxious about social situation... whenever I go out, I think people are looking at me or talking bad about me... while I know I shouldn't have these feelings and I have given every possible explanation I could give to myself but I am still anxious about going out. My question is can I think myself out of this or am I wasting my time giving explanation to myself... should I get help for my social anxiety... but I know what they will say : go out more, expose yourself to fearful situation more... but none of these are working for me... my social anxiety is getting worse... what can I do to overcome it.
