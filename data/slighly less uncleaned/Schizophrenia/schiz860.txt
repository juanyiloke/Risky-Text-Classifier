d1 this is the truth i'm someone who is just writing the truth, and writing whats going on inside my head okay i'm someone who doesn't know what he wants i've heard of schizophrenia people turning normal and i believe in it because i believe people can change, from anything to anything(<-i'm being narcisstic right now * damn the trip is wearing off * ) i dont' think i will remember much of this, of what i actually meant so i'll try to make it detailed some thoughts may contradict because i'm messed up right now with reality with what i want, with everything i don't think i have anything sorted anyway i''m writing this in public because i want to believe that i'm actually doing this moving forward and if i write it in public then that means that its out there so i have to write the truth ( and no possiblity of decieving myself with lies or fantasy - not that i care of what anybody thinks - because if i write it in public on this website then its not something i'm saving to read later ( suppose i wrote it on my laptop or handwritten notes then i'll get reminded of them later when i'm formatting my computer or cleaning off my room ) .. here, on thiswebsite , i'll write and maybe forget, and only if its important to me later i'll get back to it.. and not because i got reminded of it first ) grr what i mean is that if i need it for any reason, i'll remember it and then come on this site, but if i don't need it then i wont get back to it, and if i don't realise that there is a reason i need it then who ccares.... anyway i'm just writing it here, for some reason but i'm following my feelings it feels like if i write it in public then it'll be the truth... maybe because i dont want to be afraid to tell people what i think ( maybe a fantasy - always chosing the worst case scenario - worst case being that its still a fantasy ) it all feels like i'm in loops and one thought intruding the other, anyway my point is , that i'm still narcisstic and paranoid except the last few weeks, i've done well ( well being eliminating my narcisstic and paranoid thought, i almost completely eliminated maybe, maybe about 70% but there were times that it was almost 90% ) , anyway, what i'm trying to write is .... i got sidetracked.... so anyway, my state right now, is i'm slightly delusioned ... okay trip almost over so hope i come back here again sometime.. i've really not decided anything...
