How is your speech and socialising affected?by WildLost » Mon May 18, 2015 11:38 pmI am showing many (early) signs of schizophrenia; most have not been a problem so far but lately they are affecting my socializing badly. I am unable to tell it myself but I'll start with some of the things others have mentioned; My facial expressions, approach, gestures are inappropriate. I stand/stare/move awkwardly, frozen in observing the situation and not having anything to do myself. I can go silent for hours, not a word to add to the conversation (or to the few small talk words in circle). When I do it somehow interrupts others' vibe - being eccentric, heavy, unrelated or not making any sense - appearing offensive, specially to new people. When talking for a longer time, I can describe a topic of interest with great enthusiasm but quickly jump between (to others unrelated) associations. In my silent moments I usually drift thinking about the world around me, focus on a certain material, pattern, idea behind it, often leading to magical/spiritual ends. I never hear anyone talk out loud about the things I usually think about. What is your experience regarding any unusual thoughts and coping with social situations/successfully 'navigating' them ? Does this get better or worse in time? I feel that no matter how hard I try, I never appear quite normal and it tires me so I am spending most of my time alone.
