ÊVenlafaxine (extended release)Hello All!! I have been on Prestiq (desvenlafaxine)for about six months only to say it has stopped working.... So I went to a medical doctor and he told me to try Venlafaxine (Effexor XR). He started me off on 150mg which was too strong. Made me so dizzy I could not drive. So I have been on 75mg for about two weeks now and this stuff is the devil!! I am so angry and pissed off at the world, no sex drive whatsoever, no remorse for anything that I do and I am totally losing affection with my fiance!!!! I wanted to just switch back to my Prestiq, but I heard the withdrawals from Venlafaxine are horrible. The only thing is I have been taking it for two and a half weeks, so I wouldn't think the withdrawals would be that bad. Why would Venlafaxine and Desvenlafaxine be so very different?? It is in the same class of drugs but make me feel totally different. So frustrating....
