ÊWays to prepare for episode?This week I was awakened by a voice. I had a psychotic episode in 2009, and I remember being awakened by voices in the weeks leading up to the episode. I have never experienced this voice problem before except for in 2009.I wonder what I should do if I have another episode, and will I realize I'm having psychosis? I had never heard of psychosis in 2009, I hid it from everybody except family, and they didn't know about psychosis either. They believed it was spiritual, and I think they still do.Hopefully I will never have another episode, but the voice made me concerned. I was able to conceal my delusions last time. I remember doing my job as normal while believing that somebody was teleporting papers off my desk to tease me. I hope this time I or somebody else will understand that I have a problem and help me. Better yet I hope it never happens.ÊAny suggestions?
