ÊWhen can they force-medicate me?I live in the US (Texas). I don't think I need to take anti-psychotics, but my therapists always tell me I should. I told my current therapist, that I completely recovered in October, and I'm fine now, but she said people with psychosis never think they have psychosis.This had made me wonder if there are any circumstances where therapists could force me to take anti-psychotics. I'm sure if I committed a crime, then they could force me to take medication, but what if I say something that is misunderstood by the therapist? This makes me wonder if I need to be more careful about what I say.Any advice? (Sorry, I'm sure this might seem like a silly question to many of you, but my psychosis was very mild, and I was not treated at all. I just got better gradually over several years.)
