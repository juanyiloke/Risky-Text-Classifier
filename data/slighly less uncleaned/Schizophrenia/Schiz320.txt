I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, and I'm stressing about what I need to tell her. One of my most persistent hallucinations/delusions was that bugs were crawling all over my body, into my ears and mouth, biting me, etc. I usually couldn't see them, just felt them and slapping at them would make them go away. I've been symptom-free for the past few weeks thanks to Zyprexa, but in the past two days, the feeling that I'm being eaten by bugs has come back. At the same time, my car is currently infested with ants because I left a drink in it overnight, which attracted bugs. (I know they're real, my mom saw them and sprayed my car with Raid.) I don't know if I'm just imagining that bugs are on me because I've seen real ones in my car, or if I'm hallucinating again and need to tell my psych. I don't want her to change my meds if everything is fine and I'm just being stupid, but I don't know if this is a problem. What should I do?? (sorry this was so long, I'm really freaking out about this!)
