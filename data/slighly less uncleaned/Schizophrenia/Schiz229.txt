Catholic guilt and feelings of missing out on life. Reason im tied to the apt is due to me not having money and living in the poverty part of the city. The inside is great tho, did a lot of artistic work. Had a rough time when when i was 20 a year after i moved here, but now that im 28 things are starting to stabalize. Finally getting used to the noise(mostly the sirens)Just gonna have to learn to accept where i am in life. I only go out for food drinks and smokes, thats it. Im quite entertained on my tablet and productive and social on my pc. Made this thread to help me gain support in accepting my place in the world
