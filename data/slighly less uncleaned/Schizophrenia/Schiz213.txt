I get 10 MG tablets of abilify every month and they tried to sell me the generic today...i went with my mom and she knows some stuff (more than me in some ways), and she said "No no we need to talk to the doctor first before we get the generic version"so the lady re-filled my prescription and we got the abilify regular and it came out to $5 instead of the generic which was $10....although usually the abilify costs $25 for 10 mg tablets...they used a coupon...which took $20 off.has anyone tried the abilify generic? My Mom said something about how the insurance will stop covering non-generic anyways in october??? but until then I need to talk to the doctor first before we switch to generic.... confused
