Its pizza night and im excited. I love pizza. Sydney verse carlton in the footy tonight. Will be a boring game. Syd will flog them.I went for a drive to Ocean Grove today. I want a house there. Trying to decide whether to buy or rent. I rented there for a year about 5 years ago and loved it. I want to buy an apartment there but im scared of commitment. Dont know how ill handle a loan from bank. Maybe rent would be best for me. The Wanderer.
