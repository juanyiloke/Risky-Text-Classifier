Êpretending I'm someone elseThoughts race through my head and I can't make them stop. Bad thoughts. I can't focus. I can't focus on my work and the things I need to get done. I imagine myself in worse off scenarios than the reality. It makes me feel better. But I end up not getting my work done. I pretend I'm someone I'm not. I imagine myself looking and being different. There are two sides to me and my boyfriend's seen them both. One is the real, loving, confident me. The other's someone who scares the real me.
