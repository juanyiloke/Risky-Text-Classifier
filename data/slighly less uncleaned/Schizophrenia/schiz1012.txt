Reprogramming a deluded mindTo reprogram the brain/thoughts and shift the state of mind can take years, especially with severe mental illness.I decided to try and take on the illness a couple of years ago, it was a do or die issue. I was going into episode and diverted the energy into trying to control the thoughts, I used forced concentration techniques, which consume a lot of energy with forced focus. Then after a month or so of this, I started an exercise routine, started off with light walking and gradually increasing the duration and tempo. Then I adjusted the diet, reduced sugar intake, coffee, fatty foods, reduced salt.Then I quit the cigarettes, with the reduction and elimination of these things, you have more feeling and thoughts, not just the good ones. Then shortly after I was slowly taken off the thorazine by my doc.I also used a form of homemade psychoanalysis, which included science, fitness, psychology, philosophy, religion, to analyse my past/present/future.I also included low energy and high energy hobbies, which are good to shift attention from feelings/thoughts, this is very very important.This is a very brief description of the way I helped myself to improve my quality of life. My awareness and understanding of myself which lead to more acceptance of myself and my life.I know a lot of people lurk and read these, I hope I can inspire and make you aware of some seemingly easier to do options to help yourselves.
