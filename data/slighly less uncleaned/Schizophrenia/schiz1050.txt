Prodromal phase ?Hi everyone,i'm new and i'm here because a few months ago i've started to have strange perceptual symptoms,when i look at a light and then i move my eyes the light leave a trials beheind it,sometimes when i look at something a "ghostly" copy start floating around the object,then i have tons of visual snow and afterimages lasts for really long time.I am also derealized,i feel strange and the world around me seems unreal and like a dream.Yesterday i went to my psychiatrist (i am in care for depression) and i talked to him about thesesymptoms,he said that the situation resemble the prodromal stage of psychotic disorders and he'll going to put me on zyprexa next monday.I also said to him that recently (3 months ago) i used strong hallucinogens and that possibly i have HPPD (hallucinogen perception persisting desease).you who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia,what symptoms did you had before the proper psychosis manifested ?Thanks in advance and sorry for my english,it's not my first language.
