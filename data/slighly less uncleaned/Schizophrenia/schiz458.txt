ÊIf your interested in hearing about my experience with schizoaffective disorderI've been schizoaffective for about 6 years now. I talk to marylin monroe, god, jesus, my girlfriend, my mom, dad, grandma, friends I've met, friends that I haven't met, and many more that I can't count. For the most part I'm usually pretty happy, but on rare occasions I have my off days. I've recently started making youtube videos about my life from being schizoaffective till now. If you leave a reply on here I'll try my hardest to get back to you. I would love to hear about your experiences, who knows maybe I can help you with your current experiences.
