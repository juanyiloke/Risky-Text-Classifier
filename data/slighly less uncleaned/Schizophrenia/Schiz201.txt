like i dont feel much really, its really hard to have and maintain an erection but before that can happen you really need to have the feelings and urges that send the messages to the brain that allow that to happen,i spend a lot of time with some female friends and they know whats up and i just wish i could get those feelings back that i had when i was in school, i dont care if its painful if i had to try and hide it, just want to feel some thing,porn doesnt even work anymore, i see those things like i would look at an object but not with desire, its like i have no desires, i'm not wanting or yearning for it, like my natural ability to procreate has been blunted.
