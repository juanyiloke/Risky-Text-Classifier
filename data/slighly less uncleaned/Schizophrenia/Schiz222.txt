Recently, a friend who I drink with has been telling me the next day about things I said and did the night before. I know that alcohol, when consumed in excess, can cause next day memory blackouts. After both Monday and Tuesday nights this week, the friend has been telling me about suggestive acts I did and some odd things that I said. I had no memory of any of it. I do have other times when I did recall perpetrating suggestive acts the next day. But on Tuesday in particular, I did not drink anywhere near enough to cause total memory blackout. I have high tolerance for alcohol and usually remember everything that happened the night before.Maybe I'm over-analyzing, which I tend to do, but I began to suspect that the behaviors were either performed in a state in which I had gone into a dissociative state and had no conscious awareness at the time, or that it was dissociation from the memory. Obvious solution to this would be to not drink alcohol, of course! No one else can really tell me what happened to me this week.I felt that this is really scary. I take the possibility of starting to dissociate seriously, and I went into a severe anxiety attack this morning. There are psychological reasons that it could be going on. I'm conflicted about the relationship with this person, not comfortable with my sexuality, having issues with where this relationship may be going, and issues with my past and can having more than a friend in my life fit into my concept of identity? I can only hope that there will be no more of this stuff. I may set up a tape recorder- I want to know what is coming out of my mouth! Maybe I can't drink around the friend anymore.
