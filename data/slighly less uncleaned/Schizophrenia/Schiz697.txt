ÊCheck in????So I'm gonna post this in both schizoaffective, anxiety, and psychosis because I don't know....My pdoc thinks I might have schizoaffective disorder because in her words, I don't "look like I'm psychotic". Or whatever that means ahah. I don't know if that's a relief or not but I'd really like an official diagnosis just to know what the hell is wrong with me. :/My hallucinations continually get worse every day but my pdoc just thinks they're anxiety/trauma- based even though they started before my trauma???? Whatever. I just wanna know what's wrong with me....ÊShe upped my dose of Zoloft and Geodon so I guess that should help, hopefully. She also mentioned partial hospital which I kinda do kinda don't want I don't know.ÊInstead, I'm changing from individual therapy every other week to now once a week so that should do something. So I'll have individual every week plus three groups each week and a fourth group every other week.ÊHopefully I'll feel better in a couple of months but I'm not really holding my breath.ÊI'm just so sick of everything, especially life. Ugh. Oh, and now I'm officially diagnosed with PTSD, WHICH I ALREADY KNEW I HAD FOR YEARS LOL.ÊAnd tomorrow is the anniversary of my best friend's death so yay. I'm having so much fun. *notice the sarcasm*ÊHope all is well for everyone.Ê
