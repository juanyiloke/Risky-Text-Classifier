I was for first brought to the psychiatrist because my aunty thinks there is something wrong with me like rocking my body back and fourth and I sing outside her shop,when I was still working for herShe asked me if I wanted to visit a psychiatris and I told her yes,out of boredom.I didn't have trouble with mood,aggressive behavior before taking any kind of psychiatric medsWhen we enter the psychiatrist office,I remember my aunty sort of "annoyed" him by asking her question very quickly and than I talked to the psychiatrist for a while alone and he diagnosed me with schizophreniaSometimes i think if the doctor had made the correct diagnosis because I never had voices and I had strange thinking only after I take psy meds and stop them.I wrote this is to share to you guys how I was diagnosed,should I get a re-evaluation and give myself a new chance to see if I am really sz.Anyway,I have been on meds far too many years,it might be a little late to get on without meds...How are you diagnosed?Sometimes still ain't satisfied with your diagnosis,or are you a real SZ with voices and delusion?The way you use this forum,is it helping you or stopping you to move forward in life??Last Friday.i message a friend and posted a link to this forum,my intention was to let him read one of my post and hopefully he can read it and give me some suggestion and advice.He got angry and asked me to move on and said I should stop visiting this forum.I was suppose to visit him in Singapore the next day,but he messaged me and said I should only visit him "when I think I am not ill",so we cancelled the meetup/meeting.He is a guy whom I knew when I go to the support group at the hospital,not from the online meetup.I still had the very habit to go to this forum,maybe he is right,i might not be so ill if I didn't visit this forum very often...I meetup with people who had depression and SA,they are like my friends now.During the meetup I open up that I had schizophrenia and they had SA and Depression.I always knew my problem isn't psychosis but emotional and social problem,I hope they are cool about my problem,we had a good time that day,everything should be coolAll of them doesn't take medication and probably doesn't need.There is a cute girl has taken two years of meds and had already stop.I think their condition is good enough to not need meds and they are not SZ tooThese mental illness,schizophrenia must have been caused by my parent.At age 1 I was given to a babysitter home and stayed there till age 5-6,I cried a lot a lot and don't want to leave my babysitter or nanny home because they took care of me well and I developed relationship with them,in the end I left and didn't really able to adjust to the new lifestyle and people at 6When I was 11 I was sent to a tutor house and the tutor caned me a lot to improve my studiesI hate my parent for doing these to me,they let me live with my nanny and I developed trust with my nanny and at age 6 they made me feel the bad separation and everything has gone bad,I wish they get punished for their unintentional but harmful act,I really do...
