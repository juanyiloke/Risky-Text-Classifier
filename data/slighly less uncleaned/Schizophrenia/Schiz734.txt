ÊDoes anyone else feel a bit lost when coming out of a psychotic episode?Well I guess I feel confused anyway but a part of me must feel a bit attached to the feeling that I'm being watched as whenever it all starts to go away I do mainly feel relief but there's also a feeling of what now? Like it was giving me some meaning or some weird thing. I don't know if anyone else feels the same and can explain it better than me?Part of me feels like I'm looking for an explanation, it's really difficult to explain. It's a weird feeling. I think my CPN is right this all probably stems down to an innate feeling of loneliness.ÊI take my meds so obviously I would much rather be without the psychosis at the end of the day.
