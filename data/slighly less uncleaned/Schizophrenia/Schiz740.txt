ÊSo what to do?So I found this site and decided to join to ask some questions. I have heard voices and seen things since I was young. The past year it has been getting pretty bad and my wife finally started asking me why I did some of the stuff i do. So I told her some things and she wants me to go see someone.ÊNow I know that some of what I see can not be real. Like a few nights ago opening my front door and a whole bunch of birds flying out of my foyer while my family sat a few feet away not seeing anything. Now since I talked to her I have looked at some stuff online and I seem to see that most people say if I can acknowledge that what I see can not be real then I am not sick. So should I tell her I am fine, or maybe just depressed is why I do not leave the house and have those funky days where I sit alone in my office? I do not want to go to a doctor just to be told I am imagining things.
