Êsorting out egoive been bouncing this theory around lately. since the voices started, ive changed my views on religion, law, and how i fit into the pre-written catagories. ive decided that since the voices want me to die, and be food for the devil, and the humans around me have rejected me as worthy company because of stigma and fear. ive come to fully reject historical religious beliefs that have formed our western self deception. i believe the good people are deliberately ignorant to the plight of the realists, and the evil ones deceive to sacrifice the innocent. after dumping my feeling stuck inbetween these modern psychopaths, i feel free, i feel my ego breathing again, pointing me in the proper direction towards a world view that makes sense. the reason is because i dont believe in the mantra set forth by religion, god-devil/right-wrong...these need to exist but they are merely how our brains determine action. so that negates sin as thought, there are no thought crimes as the brain has to consider things, which is imagination bounced off logic and memory to impulses which control how a reaction occurs.
