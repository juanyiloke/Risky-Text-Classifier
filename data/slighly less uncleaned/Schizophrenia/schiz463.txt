ÊHow many symptoms do you have every day and are on meds?On meds here, Paliperidone injec once a month.Not sure how many of these are related to schizophrenia or not.Pure and utter severe despair.My thoughts are outside of my head where people can see/know them.Paranoia of the supernatural order, results in difficulty going out.Anxiety from mild to severe.Social situations largely imposible due to empty mind, bereft of thoughts and not able to comprehend conversations, leads to severe awkwardness.Difficulty in accepting my diagnoses of Paranoid Schizophrenia.Voices (not constant) inside and outside of my head of people I know and don't know.Motivation is a big issue.
