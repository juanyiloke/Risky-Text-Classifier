I was just standing in my room, when out all of a sudden I heard a big explosion, and I'm sure I felt the ground shaking, I had difficulty trying not to fall. But I got worried because nobody else seemed to have noticed it. My cats were still sleeping, my brother didn't came to me to sk if I had felt it too. My mum didn't run upstairs to ask if we were allright. So I'm kinda wondering if it was real. I've had halucinations before, but not like this. My parents don't know about this, I'm afraid to tell.... But it sure was creepy.
