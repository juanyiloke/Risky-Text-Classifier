ÊWondering if I need medsI had psychosis one time for about two weeks, and that was five years ago. I didn't know what was wrong with me, so I didn't get treatment. I had hallucinations once in a while for a year afterwards, and it took me several years to overcome some delusional ideas created by the psychosis.I also have chronic depression. I don't take any medications, but I try to exercise every day.The last week has been strange, and I'm concerned that I might get psychosis again. I feel nervous and I'm not sleeping well. I think I am experiencing depersonalization or derealization right now, but it's not too bad. I just feel like my body is made of rubber and I'm floating. Little things seem really stressful. Last night, I was so upset, but I found that sitting in the enclosed space of my car in the sun for an hour made me feel more calm.I see my therapist tomorrow, but she is so pushy about wanting me to take medicine.Last time, I just snapped and went from normal to psychotic with almost no warning signs.Do you think I will understand what is wrong with me if it happens again - that way I can get medication to deal with it? Or do I need to avoid a relapse by taking medication preventatively?
