Hallo, I am 25 and I have been suffering from Schizophrenia for the past year and a half. I have done lots of research into possible alternative treatments and have found a very effective one. Niacin treatment. This was discovered by Abram Hoffer. He came up with the term Ortomolecular which means the right combination of vitamins to correct a molecular imbalance in the brain. I have just started on 1500mg today and already my only symptoms of paranoia are disappearing. The key is to get the niacin up to about 4000mg a day without the flushing effect. Ideally the patent should take as much niacin up to the point where they go red and then stop. The body gets used to this meaning no flush and eventually you raise it again until it goes red and you stop, and so on. I live in Ireland so I can discharge myself from the local clinic and taking drugs is not mandatory by law. I plan to leave the clinic soon to try Hoffers approach. Here are some good links that explain everything. I would not recommend going off of drugs and discharging yourself until you are confident that this will work.
