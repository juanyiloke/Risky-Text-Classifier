For the schizophrenics in here: Are your voices any different from they way they were in the beginning? Worse? Better?ÊMy voices terrified me in the beginning -- not being able to escape their 24/7 torture was absolutely horrifying. It took a while before I realized the voices are a fabrication of my own mind and *not* a physical threat from an outside source.ÊEventually, the voices became somewhat entertaining -- they would say the funniest and most dramatic things, and I would make fun of them. I also made them say goofy things, which was my way of getting even with them. Tee hee. I even gave them dorky nicknames.ÊThen, they were pretty much annoying... It's like OK, show's over...ÊNow, the voices are just plain boring. I rarely even "hone in" or pay attention to them anymore. They are pretty much like a TV playing in the background -- I mess around with them when I feel like it, and they fade in the background when I need to concentrate on other things.ÊI'm just curious to see how the voices have evolved for the rest of the schizophrenics in this forum.
