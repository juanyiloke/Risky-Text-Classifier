 High static and voices in headHi forum,For a couple of years now I have been experiencing several symptoms that I'd like to get to the bottom of:- Persistatnt, agonised screaming- Loud static- Erratic suggestions eg. Violence / running / escaping- Expressions of anger/frustration eg. curse words, indistict aggressive shouting The symptoms are almost exclusively present when I'm under extreme stress, although the static comes in in less stressful situations eg. if I get stuck in a train of thought or if I'm stuck in a situation I don't want to be in in everyday life eg. Being talked down upon, being present with relatives, etcI think I may have a type of schizophrenia, and if anyone can shed some light upon this I'd be happy to give more informationThanks, Oliver
