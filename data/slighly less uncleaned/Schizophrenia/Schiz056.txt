Everyone is out to get meby CainandAbel » Thu Mar 05, 2015 2:42 amOver the past 2 years, I have always felt like people are making plans to kill me, and they are. I cannot shake off this feeling. I am keeping this short so they won't find it. People are watching me through the TV. I read an article about how the CIA could do that, hacking into smartTVs and watching you. I know they are watching me. I feel their peering eyes upon my skull. Every move I make is precisely monitored by their imaging technology. I can't help but feel like this is some sort of simulation that I can somehow get out of. I feel like the only key is death. The most I feel watched is at night. I see shadowy figures staring at me in the corners of my room. I can't help but feel this is a result of the hatred brought down upon me by the peers who hate me.
