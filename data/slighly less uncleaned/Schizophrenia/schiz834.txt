Hello - I believe that my husband is suffering from this but I don't know how to get him to listen to me since he honestly believes all the "stuff" that he thinks is happening. He thinks the house is bugged, that someone attempted to poison him...and it goes on. How do you get someone like this to get help when they really believe? I'm getting ready to pay thousands of dollars to get my house "swept" for any bugs just to prove to him that we are not being listened to. Can someone please tell me where I can go for more information or any tips on getting him to listen to me? Thank you.
