What do your voices say to youby Sickmonkey » Wed Mar 11, 2015 11:25 pmI'm just curious about other people's experiences, what do your voices say, do theyTalk to you directly and if so do you respond to them? Are they internal (like thoughts) or external (like someone in the room). I'm having a hard time with mine as they tell me every day that I am dead, that I'm not sick and that I died from an earlier attempt to hurt myself. They sometimes talk to me but its mostly about me and they are always internal like I'm having an internal conversation , they say you are dead, you died and you will never see your family again most of the time, they also say everyone is a fake or imposter, being able to share this with others sort of makes me feel better but I wanted to see what some other people's experiences have been.
