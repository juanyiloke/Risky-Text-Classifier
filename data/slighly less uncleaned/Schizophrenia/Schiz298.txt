i feel messed up & very damaged from everything that has gone on. i find it impossible to try & let go of & accept the past more & way everything is.i've tried & done everything i can to heal & recover from everything. i used a lot of drink/drugs in the past & also had a lot of very severe psychosis. First episode was at the age of 17, & i had a very bad experience of being forced sectioned & forced drugs on a locked ward for 4 months - i was very heavily medicated. At the time when i was released, i went into full time work for a few years before another major episode/breakdown, that ended in a severe suicide attempt & another hospitalisation.Age 25 i was again hospitalised & placed on a very high dose of neuroleptic medication, which i stopped after a year cold turkey & again resulted in another section & hospital stay.In total i was hospitalised 4 times.The past 13 years i've been following a path of sobriety & exploring everything i can in regards to healing. The first 3 years of sobriety i stopped the medication twice & had a lot of very severe psychosis. For the past 10 years i have maintained a low dose of the neuroleptic medication - i'm too scared of what would would happen if i stopped it again.i haven't been able to stop smoking tobacco, & feel very heavily addicted to it. i need to try & exercise more but am very lacking in motivation. My overall functioning has been very effected & i have very low motivation. i've not been well enough to work for 13 years, & it's a job to maintain the stability i have & independent living.i feel very abused/damaged by the psychiatric system, & i don't feel they have been much help. i find this society largely very uncaring & not very understanding with it all.i've not had the worst of lives, but things have also been very difficult. Family dynamics have been hard & 'dysfunctional'.i suppose it's a case of plodding on as best as possible.i had difficulties in childhood, first sectioned at the age of 17, & problems ever since (am now 42).i have made a lot of progress, but also still have a lot of problems. Overall circumstances are hard. i've been single 16 years, living alone & out of work for 14 years. i can't see that i'll ever work again (i did 8 years of full time work & 7 years of further education in the past).i maintain a low dose of one neuroleptic medication, & it does help, i can't see that i'll ever successfully get off it.i have really struggled to accept the biomedical psychiatric view of my condition, but i do accept the diagnosis.i've tried my best with everything & continue to do my best, i have felt that i have been blamed & shamed a lot with everything.i get difficulties with sleep/bad & strange dreams, bad feelings & difficult emotional states, anxiety/social anxiety (a lot of worry & fear), depression & what i identify as some form of PTSD.i find motivation so hard, especially with trying to do more exercise & managing the basics of my life. i feel drained a lot of the time. i'm coming up to 14 years sober, but i smoke a lot of tobacco & feel hopelessly addicted to it, & live a very sedentary lifestyle.i have always felt & feel i need more in the way of understanding & support - proper psychological help & social support - But i can't access it, nor create/find that in my life, & not through lack of trying.There is a lot to be very grateful for - there is also a lot of struggle & suffering at times.i don't want any suggestions - just wanted to share some of where i'm at.
