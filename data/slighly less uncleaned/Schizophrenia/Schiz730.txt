Êsifting through possible clueson tv recently i was watching a show on aliens. It made mention of australian aboriginees who said that they believe the human race was made in "dreamstate"?? and that an alien race had given their first shaman "stones" in his head to communicate with the aliens.Im going to possibly sound like im reaching a bit with this. But when my voices started, it was at age 7, 1 night only, i woke up frozen in bed (sleep paralysis), hearing whispers and foot shuffles near me. i unfroze myself and heard/experienced nothing until my mid 20s. I believe the aboriginees defined how and when we are "tagged" for this "illness".
