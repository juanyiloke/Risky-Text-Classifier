I've managed to be presentable as what society would call "normal" but I'm so weary and past the break of insanity. My head has horrific voices all day, among other things. I manage to ignore them but it's just terrible as must of you know. I try to stay positive but it feels like I can't handle this, (felt like I couldn't handle it for years now but I'm still here) i don't know why I decided to post this, it's just too much for me I need some rest.
