People say that sometimes, that i get free money. Working is obviously the better choice when compared to schizophrenia. Do they imagine that they would still be themselves or something? Do they think "oh, if i only got that then i could have some fun." It wouldn't be this way at all, you would drift off into suicide land and be poisoned to death slowly. Being poisoned is some painful stuff to, who would choose that over a job anyway? Id much rather work at a grocery store or restaurant, that stuff is cake compared to this. I can't tell though if these businesses are ripping them off or if they are just flatout lazy, probably both actually. A bad mixture of things right there. I would be perfectly willing to trade, you take the schiz and ill take the job. Free money. Ha! Ignorant, i might be crazy but people are ignorant in saying these things. If people just want free money and to do nothing the world is pretty much boned in everyway, might as well just give up if thats the case. It doesn't come cheap to say the least.
