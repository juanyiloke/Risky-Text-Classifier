So before I was diagnosed I was a lot more easy going. Could hang out with any of my friends. But nowadays I realize some people kinda try and mess with you verbally/mentally. Completely unwarranted, just say disrespectful things to bring you down.I've come to realize that I can't hang out with certain friends of mine anymore because of this, they just dont want to play nice. Last night a friend of mine kept dissing me over and over for no real reason, it actually surprised me and I'm still thinking about it today, but I think I'm going to avoid meeting this friend from now on. Nothing personal but just for my own mental well being.What do you think of this and does anyone have a similar experience? I've had to do this with 2 of my friends in the past, and it looks like this friend from yesterday will be a 3rd.
