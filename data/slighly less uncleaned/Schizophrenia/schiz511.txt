ÊHow to cope with thought broadcasting and voice hearing?
Hi, I'm 21 years old and was diagnosed as being schizo-affective earlier this year after 3 years of being diagnosed as being bi polar with a psychosis not otherwise specified. Earlier this year (and it has happened 2 times before) I admitted myself into mental hospital because I was convinced people could hear my thoughts.

This was in May and I have since been seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, and have a case manager helping me out. I' still not completely convinced that people can't hear my thoughts. I hear a voice all day that constantly tells me "everyone can hear your thoughts" or "I can hear your thoughts". The most disturbing part about it is it sounds like a friend that I had in high school. That makes me feel very vulnerable and when the voice isn't saying the two previous comments it is usually being mean and rude, commenting on every thought I have.

For people who have been in the same situation, how did you handle it and make it go away? I'm currently taking 20 mg of Abilify, 200 mg of vistaril, and 800 mg of seroquel at night and the voices and delusional thoughts have still not gone away.Ê

Thanks in advance, Dan
