lack of motivation and schizophreniaby twinkle86 » Mon Jun 01, 2015 2:53 amI was doing fine with my schizophrenia and managing it with meds. The problem is now that I have the illness under control for the most part I still have negative symptoms and lack motivation. For example my hobbies include writing and art. I signed up for online art classes and I did the first project and that's it. There are still 44 projects to do and I have not made a dent into them. As far as writing, when I was younger I won several writing competitions and was pretty good. I have a story idea that I have developed for the past year but I can't find myself to write it down. I just don't want to be one of those people who's whole life passes them by and they do nothing with their lives. I have so many dreams I'd like to accomplish but I can't seem to find the motivation to do them. I know there are some successful people on the forum that are schizophrenic so I am asking what tips do you have to get out of this funk and find motivation.
