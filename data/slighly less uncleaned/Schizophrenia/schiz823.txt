Really, i was, they called it schizophrenia. Someone was in my mind and part of it was making me think and percieve things. They were also terrifying the blank out of me by way of horrendous threats and strange things. What they call hallucinations have even physically harmed me on two seperate occasions while appearing to me. Several of my visuals are also seen by others, like shaman. Aliens, ufos, satyrs, shadow people, light beings, a ghost, and other things as well. When these beings, or what looks like beings began to appear, they started making me look at the same times repeatedly as well. Like 3, 333, 1111, 222, 555, 444, 616, stuff like that. Voices have also proven that they are seperate and have a conscious cause. They have known where to find things when i didn't know where to look, have told me the outcomes of a sporting event twice, and even made a joke once using the exact time when i didn't know what time it was at all. Schizophrenia is not schizophrenia at all, they're in our heads and are doing things with/to us. They can also make it look different with each of us and make it look like it was caused by something it is not. They can make you see things, hear things, feel, taste, think things, perceive things, all of it really they can do to the mind. Needless to say it isn't really genetic or any of that stuff. And when a nice fella at a bar makes you visually hallucinate and then yells at you that he's a witch then it becomes a little more obvious on top of everything else. Wow this blanking sucks!
