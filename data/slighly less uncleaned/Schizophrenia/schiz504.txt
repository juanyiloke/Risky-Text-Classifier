 Voices: Inside or Outside?Quick question. Cus I'm dashing off to work in a second. But I'd be interested to view some replies once I'm back from work. I hear voices, fairly regularly. I go through bouts of hearing voices which are sometimes more intense. I often hear 'background' voices along with other experiences. Are your voices inside or outside your head? My social worker asked me this yesterday. I know a lot of people talk about hearing voices. I've heard internal / inside voices a lot. Constantly. It's when I go through bouts of hearing voices from outside of my head that I get most frightened. It's usually just jumbled bits of speech I can hear. A voice similar to my own, only deeper. I find it very frightening. Does anyone else hear voices from outsidetheir head?
