ÊCBT?Hello guys, it's been over 2 years since my first mental breakdown. I am taking my meds as prescribed by my doctor. But I am not feeling any better... I still from time to time get paranoid that everyone else is talking about me and trying to humiliate me...and when I am not paranoid I am anxious as hell... I feel an uneasy feeling in my stomach and I am always stressed and always thinking negatively... I am on olanzapine for my psychosis and flumod for my depression but I am still not feeling any better, psychotic episodes aren't that frequent but my social anxiety and depression aren't getting better.I have heard about CBT, I want to know if it works ? But I am not seeing any therapist because I have negative symptoms for which I cannot speak my mind clearly and since for a therapy session to work, there should be communication between the doctor and the patient, I feel like therapy is not for me. But I am not feeling better despite taking my medication. I find it hard to do the things I used to enjoy doing, I also feel stupid and worthless, I find it hard to understand and process what others are saying and find it hard to relate to people. I am depressed and anxious as hell. I have isolated myself from any social contact completely.I want to know what can I do from my end other than taking medication to get better. Should I ask my doctor about seeing a therapist or should I wait it out and see if these depression and anxiety and paranoid thinking goes away with time?
