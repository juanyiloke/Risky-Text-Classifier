Severely impaired social functionby mystica » Tue Feb 24, 2015 3:00 amHey guys.. I'm not sure this belongs here since I haven't officially been diagnosed but I think I might have schizophrenia. If it doesn't, please help me find a more appropriate forum.. I was at a bar with an acquaintance I haven't seen in a while. There were 4 of us, but shortly after the 3 of them 'decided' I wasn't fit for 'adult convo', probably because I over-detail my stories and show interest in many things people usually deem unimportant. So they started making stuff up and targeting/mocking me with the content. I didn't know what to do or say, I never actually lie (personal decision). It was so bad, my brain 'stopped' and I just sat there, watching around/the ground, mostly avoiding eye contact. They even asked about my silence from time to time but I just sat there 'helplessly'.At some point I decided to leave and while doing so said a few words with some stranger and then suddenly he says ''the ###$ man haha you even ######6 shaked your head (in disapproval)''. I did that completely unknowingly and it certainly DID NOT match my thoughts. I just keep saying words or making noises or gestures I don't even mean or simply translate to something completely different when others look at it. There were a couple people who I thought 'understood' me, but now I'm completely alone in my beliefs, and all these people, including my parents, pointing their fingers at me and laughing. I'm very confused and I'm not sure what's real anymore.
