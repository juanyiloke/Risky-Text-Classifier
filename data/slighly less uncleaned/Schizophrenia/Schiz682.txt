ÊPosition paper re: sz/psychosis awareness, looking for feedbackHey everyone,Since I'm new, a little background. I was psychotic for approximately four months - it was triggered by heavy cannabis use but I figure that I was in the prodromal stage for far longer. After an involuntary commitment, a two week stay in the ward, two months of AP and LOTS of research I can now say that I am managing quite well.Lately I have been getting into MI advocacy as a hobby (strange, no?) I feel former consumers have an important role to play in advocating for better treatment options. I had some pretty negative experiences in the healthcare system, it took a few hospitalizations and a lot of ignorant nursing staff before I was able to get the treatment order that I needed. So I recently wrote a position paper about the importance of raising awareness regarding schizophrenia and psychotic disorders amongst front-line healthcare workers. It's a long one (approx. 2800 words) but I am hoping to get some feedback on it. The plan is to present the paper to my local healthcare board in May with organizational support from the community mental health team.It seems I'm unable to post links, so if you are willing to take a look, Google this line and it should be the only result that pops up.Scribd "The Importance of Awareness Surrounding Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders Amongst Frontline Healthcare Workers in Improving Patient Prognosis"Thanks so much. Very happy to see there is an online community like this.
