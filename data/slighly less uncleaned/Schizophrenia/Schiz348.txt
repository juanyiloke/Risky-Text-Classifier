I work on an army base. They have a warning system of four levels of seriousness because of the constant threat of terrorism. This past year it has been a yellow sign up on the doors that they post to warn of a mild threat. But this past week they upped the level of warning to purple which means that for some reason there's is a bigger threat to their building.So they were on a heightened alert and they posted guards right inside the entrance to the base that we drive into.AND inside the building itself. Double security.Well, I got to work on time at 7:30 am but about 10:00 am the lights inside the building went out and an alarm sounded and a man came on all the speakers that are situated in the break rooms and offices. The man said it was only a test but ten seconds later a women came on and said that there was an emergency right outside the building and for everybody to just stay where they were until further notice. And then another alarm came on with a loud, high-pitched "Whoop, Whoop". And the girls warning and the"Whoop, Whoop", was repeated steadily for 15 minutes.Eventually it stopped. I just kept working through the whole thing and I never did find out what the incident was.
