The Gary Gomez LegacyThe symptoms of long term mental illness can be deactivated or reversed, this can be done on the pills/therapy and transitioning off them with a doctor. When you return to the busy rat race, you will need every mechanism to keep you alive. The mental illness has keptyou from full time work for a reason, so your body/brain/mind can rest, the pain is an indicator your body/brain is at risk. The best way to get yourself stable is reduced stress/lots of rest and take your meds. Also self love and compassion are very useful. You are burning to return to a complicated life, that will hurt you even more.As wise as Gary is, he still has fear about the future.For those who got to experience the religious delusions, there's a saying by an American president "god helps those who help themselves"and another saying is, If you fall down, you pick yourself up, if you fall again, you pick yourself up, if you need a rest, you take one and continueThank you for reading my posts all the former patients and the medical professionals. Take care of yourselves and each other and god bless you.The GG.
