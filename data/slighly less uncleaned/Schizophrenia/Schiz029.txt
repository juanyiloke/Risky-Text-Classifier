Mind keeps going weirdby auserx8 » Tue Apr 14, 2015 7:02 amHi all, my first post. Anyways, I've had "episodes" in the past but they were mild compared to recent where I felt like I was losing my mind and was terrified. In the past, I've heard voices in my head often when stressed and they would always say negative words or such. Growing up I felt like I had a guide that would communicate options to me, and that never really went away and is still there. I've also had problems with thinking that I had some bodily illness such as cancer or a heart problem or such, which was persistent, even though health checks turned out normal. I also end up thinking that I'm greater than everything and such and can't help but try and think it down. Recently however, I've been feeling depersonalised, as if I was trapped inside my head or something. Voices have been getting more aggressive and louder and even surreal, saying words and phrases that don't exist. They would comment on my every action and would make sarcastic remarks about me. I'd also feel like everything about my mind is fake or something -- it's hard to explain this (all I can say is that everything suddenly feels wrong, like my mind isn't real or something). At some point recently, voices were saying they were going to take my mind away -- it terrified me. Eventually I calmed down. I also have problems with paranoia, and often end up thinking that friends don't like me/that people in general dislike me/that I'm being spied on or chosen for something. I've ended up drinking to calm myself down from this but when drinking, I can sometimes lose it a bit more with paranoia.I don't know what this is but it scares me. It's gotten worse over the years so each episode is more intense (it seems to get worse from a major stressful event, e.g. recently had a breakup with my first relationship (I'm 23 f)).
