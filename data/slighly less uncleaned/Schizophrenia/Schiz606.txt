ÊPsychosis and ImaginationHi everyone,I had a quick question on becoming psychotic and using your imagination.ÊI think a lot about what it is like to be other people, and more specifically, lately, I've been trying to imagine what it's like to be psychotic and have some of the irrational beliefs psychotic people believe.ÊThe other day, I was thinking about what it was like to become Narcissistic, and I actually started to feel like I believed like I was better than other people, and felt like it could become permanent.The thing is, I'm afraid of actually becoming psychotic over time... (I have an anxiety disorder and OCD, so I don't want it to make it seem silly that I'm asking this or anything. I'd just like a basic understanding of the possibility of this occurring, I guess.)Over the past couple months, I've also been diligent about making deliberate observations and a sketch of my basic thought patterns, and I feel like at this point I have a pretty good understanding, but I almost feel like it is something that is dangerous to have that level of an awareness and understanding of for my own personal existence.Anyways, the point is, I've been manipulating my thoughts to reflect the thought patterns of people that seem to be more effective at getting through the day. Consequently, these thoughts are not natural to me and I feel like I've been becoming more and more psychotic ever since.So, basically, I guess my question is, could someone potentially develop psychosis based on experimenting with their thought patterns and trying to imagine what it would be like to be a psychotic person?
