I guess I just need someone to vent to. I've always been a better writer than speaker. The words just get caught in my throat.My boyfriend moved in 2 months ago. At first it was great, I was also attending school. Now that classes are over I don't know what to do with myself and can't seem to find the motivation to get a part time job, I don't think I could handle the stress of it besides. My boyfriend doesn't like to see me idle. He works 6-7days a week as a logger from sunrise to sunset and is exhausted when he comes home. When he comes in the door we sit at the table and talk about his day for about 30-45minutes before he showers and dinner. Then we watch tv for an hour then he goes to bed. We had a conversation Sunday, when he actually took a day off, and he said I don't talk to him about myself enough. And when we are on the couch "he makes a point of ignoring me, if I'm not going to talk to him." I just don't know how to talk about myself. I stopped giving my opinions because it feels like he just tells me I'm wrong when I do, so I don't anymore. When I told him this last night he wanted an example of this and I couldn't give him one, he made me feel like I was making it up. I have a hard time expressing emotions/feelings, opinions, talking about what I did that day. He says we only talk about light fluffy stuff and that's not enough to sustain our relationship. I grew up in a household where you were belittled for talking about yourself, so I guess I never learned how. It makes me really uncomfortable and ashamed to do so.I've thought about writing him notes or letters, but thats backfired on me in the past, one ex-bf threw a letter in my face and told me I was childish for writing it. My therapist is on vacation for 2 weeks so I can't talk to her about this. Even talking to her is painful.
