I would never kill myself. I just hate this life that I am living! These meds are poisoning me, but I still have to take them or I will go insane. I still hear voices. Voices that are threatening me. Sometimes they say they are going to kill me.People are afraid of me and I can't understand why. I have never harmed anyone in my life. People say that they hate me. Sometimes, when I lay down to sleep at night, I think that I hope that I will die in my sleep. I just hate this life!
