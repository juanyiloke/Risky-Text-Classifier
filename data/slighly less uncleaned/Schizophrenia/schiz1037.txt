Careers?Hi. I'm new to Health Boards, and I thought to register partly because I feel really alone in this.ÊI've not really been diagnosed (though my psychiatrist believes it to be schizoaffective or schizotypal or something like that. She wasn't clear last I saw her) because I keep some thingsÊsecretÊfrom my psychiatrist. I've also stopped taking medication and seeing my psychiatrist entirely which was a bad choice because I ended up in a mental health hospital for the second time.ÊÊI feel like a stranger to myself. I used to feel paranoid about everything and this was very bad at work because my occupation requires interaction with many strangers a shift. My boss is my dad so I haven't gotten fired but I think I'm negatively impacting the business because of my problems.I don't know what to do. I feel really UNMOTIVATED and unaccomplished compared to my peers. I'm "supposed to" be a junior or senior in college yet I'm still a freshman with many classes withdrawn or failed. I've NEVER failed this miserably in high school and I feel like I'm in a never ending spiral of hopelessness.I used to really want to go into a career in the health field but now I feel like my inability to socialize with others well (I have no close friends since High School graduation) - it's just hard for me and I sometimes even think I'm anti social without the crazy psycho part. I can't even talk about my illness with others because they'll label me as a crazy person.ÊSorry for rambling. >_<What careers could someone with a disorder like mine be successful in? I worry I'll end up on the streets or something ._.
