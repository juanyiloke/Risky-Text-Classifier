I guess I wasn't too sure how to start being active on this forum, so I'll just go ahead and introduce myself for everyone to see. I look forward to meeting new people and talking to those who have similar lives and troubles; people who understand.My name is Kelsey and I suffer primarily from physical delusions. Sometimes my body feels like it doesn't fit inside of itself, or my hands and feet feel upside down, or sometimes I feel that my insides and outsides don't match and they what's inside of me wants to be on the outside. I can feel the vastness of the universe inside of myself and I wonder if everyone else feels it too and is too afraid to say so.But, I don't think I'm a god. I don't think I'm special; I trust that my doctor knows the truth and that these feelings are just chemical malfunctions. I also see cats in my house that are different from my own cats. At night, I hear people walking around inside of my house and talking, though no one else hears them. I used to think they were ghosts. I'm also agoraphobic and I have trouble leaving my house, but I still manage to take classes at a university and my grades are pretty good, all things considered. I like to learn.I'm also training to be a web designer and I do commission art to make some extra money. I'm the creator of a webcomic and right now I'm designing a simple point-and-click video game. I keep myself busy with art every day when I manage to get out of bed.Anyways, enough about me. I want to hear about you! Please tell me about yourself if you would like to, and let me know if you'd like to message back and forth. I hope that we can talk together and maybe form some friendships. Have a good day, everybody.Ê~Kelsey M
