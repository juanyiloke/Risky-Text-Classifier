Telepathy is something that alot of people will not tell you exists, also they will use their telepathy against you to put thoughts into your head against the truth. Its difficult to realize what telepathy really is without someone to tell you plain and simply in your own mind. The cure of Schizophrenia is that even though you believe your feelings to be felt by another person or that another person knows the person who you really are. The line between schizophrenia and telepathy is that thoughts are not feelings and feelings are not thoughts, feelings are just what you feel. Be free in yourself that feelings should be for yourself to work on how you will come across to people
