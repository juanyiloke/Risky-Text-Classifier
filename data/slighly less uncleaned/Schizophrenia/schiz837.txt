My 28 year old close relative was diagnosed with schizophrenia approximately two years ago. Negative symptoms predominate in his case. He has little insight in his condition although, as I can see, he is quite bothered by voices. He was prescribed in the past half a dozen of medications including risperidone, clozapine etc. Currently he takes risperidone when he feels like it (he tried and stopped others because of side effects) and also takes small dose of amitriptylline almost daily. As I understand he just got used to hallucinations. Sometimes, when things get worse he starts taking his medications regularly, when things get better he may stop taking medication altogether. It is impossible to persuade him to see psychiatrist again. Recently he sustained trauma and was given Tramadol for pain relief. Interestingly, the following morning he commented that after taking the tramadol all hallucinations have gone and he had very restful sleep at night. I looked it up and it appears that tramadol is very similar to antidepressant venlafaxine. What are your thoughts on this? Is it worth trying venlafaxine for his symptom control? I have a feeling he may agree to take it regularly if it provides good symptom control.
