ÊI am schizophrenic and the wife is pregnantDuring my stable time the wife and I mangaged to conceive which we were really happy about. However I have maxed out of risperdal consta and I am switching to haldol. My voices have been really bad and they are telling me that they are going to kill the baby. I feel so sellfish by getting my wife pregnant and I fear that I am putting to much presure on her whilst my voices are bad.It was not long ago that I thought my wife was trying to poison me we have seemed only to have had a couple of good months before something happens with my voices.I just hope everything will be ok
