My sister was 20 years old when he had his first psychotic episode and later used to have one more ....now thinking as it was before the onset of the disease, the strange things that had were:-big and wide eyes, often with the expression fear and surprise-not has never been a very brilliant- Has always been a very good person, never had many interests, maybe it's always been a bit unsociableWhat you are experiencing abnormal behavior and physical appearance of a person who will become schizophrenic?big and wide eyes, with the expression sometimes frightened and surprised?
