 ....The torey government has taken power in the uk and they are going to cut the benefits for the disabled and sick there gathering evidence to say that the sick have nothing wrong with them ...they are using demons to keep an eye on us the demons can see through the walls Some are telepathic and put thoughts into your head make you dough yourselfand that is just the beginning of what they are going to do to the sick disabled and poor Unlike David Cameron i care about the disabled , Sick and Poor Am also worried that after they change the human right laws in the uk we will have no rights at all Am unable to go on protests because of my mental health but i encourage those who are able to make your voice known
