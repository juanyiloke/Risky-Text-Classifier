I was really into knives as a kid. I got it from my dad. I remember when we lived in L.A. and we had some stuff stored in our basement in boxes and crates. I was nosing around down there one day when I was about 7 or 8 and I found a large suitcase. I was curious and I opened it up. It was filled with papers and small knick-knacks. The papers was my dads old papers and doodling and drawings from when he was in grade school in the small town he grew up in. But there was also stuff like old watches, old pens that you had to dip into an inkwell to write with, old ribbons or medals he got from when he served in Korea. There was also a lot of stuff in the suitcase that was his fathers. And pocketknives.A LOT of pocketknives. Old ones that were his fathers from 1920 or 1930 or ones my dad had owned in the fifties or sixties. Well, being a young boy, I took the knives out of the suitcase to play with. These were really neat knives. They were ornately decorated and made in neat styles I have never seen before or since. So I played with them and used them to carve wood or dig holes and one by one I either lost them or broke them.ÊI forgot about them but years later I wondered if those pocketknives would have been worth anything. And I kicked myself for breaking them because they were my dads and his dads and they were irreplaceable.
