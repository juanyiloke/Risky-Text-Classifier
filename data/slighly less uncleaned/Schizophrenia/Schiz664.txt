ÊI feel like a failure. I couldn't do even an open mri.I went for my mri for my shoulder. He first lead me to a room with a closed mri machine and I told him there's no way and my doctor approved yesterday that I could have an open. So he lead me to a room that had a sign on the door saying "caution: radioactive material" and told me to sit there. I've never had anything but an X-ray. I heard this high pitched whirling noise all of the sudden and I started to freak out and hoped that was something else. There was a bag full of needles, weird clamps or something on the tablet. Lots of weird things that made my voices start talking about aliens. He lead me to the open mri and it was that machine making the noise. I finally laid down and he held my hand and told me he would show me what it would be like. He started putting me into the machine and then lifting it up and I started to panic. I felt like I was in some ****ed up torture coffin. There was no moving. I couldn't stop shaking badly. I wanted to crawl out of the machine before he had a chance to finish lowering it. He told me I would have to go to a hospital and get sedated to be able to get a clear mri because I couldn't stop shaking. He told me not to feel bad because he's had soldiers not be able to even walk into the room and seen lots of guys break down and cry. It didn't make me feel any better. The lady at the desk told me the same thing. I feel stupid that I felt like it was a secret alien experiment. I still can't stop crying.Ê
