ÊFriends: Help me out here!Hello ma peeps,I've just started getting back into programming and am not the most creative person you could meet. I feel I am at a brick wall and behind that wall is an awesome application of some sort, maybe a game, maybe a resource for information, maybe something that could help someone, something.To start off I'd like a project that I'll actually be able to finish, so something simple enough.Has anyone ever thought to themselves, "mmm if I could code I'd make a..."Anything I make at this point will be distributed freely, hopefully on the Google Play store, so don't sue me if I use your idea. No one is going to make any money from this, it's just a beginner programming assignment. Though if actually manage to make something you will be credited in the app.ÊSo what should I do?ÊI could have asked this on any forum but I wanted to get input from my friends here as we have a lot in common.Also, if anyone has any coding experience and is interested in making a project, tell me and we could try it as a team.Thanks guys!
