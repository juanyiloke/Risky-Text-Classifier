Êantipsychotics working too well?Recently I have been suffering from low mood. My cpn thinks that my antipsychotic is working too well at the dose I am at (400 mg depot of Clopixol every 3 weeks) and that I was a lot better at the lower dose I was on before (300 mg).ÊThe current dose I am at is making the voices a lot quieter - in fact I have managed to get rid of one. I am in two minds whether I was better off on the lower dose - I preferred having the two voices, just I hated them when they were in control. But on the other hand it's such a relief to have just the one voice and I feel calmer and less stressed.But my cpn thinks that the higher dose is suppressing too much of me and that's why I feel low. We are reluctant to change antipsychotic because it's been such a life saver for me and I am doing so much better - I am getting out more, my concentration has improved, and since starting Clopixol I havent self injured (my main reason of me self injuring is because the voices used to make me stressed). I have Clopixol tablets and diazapam prn (also procyclidine prn) which my cpn is thinking I should take on the lower dose. I dont want to get rid of my voices because they provide company, I just dont want them controlling me.ÊI am also possibly facing being inpatient because the risk of harming myself is quite high because of my low mood. But I was in hospital last year due to low mood and trying to kill myself. My cpn doesnt want me in hospital, and thinks it is due to time of year.ÊSo my question is, has anyone had their antipsychotics work too well and taken too much of the voices away? Is there any way of getting things better other than lowering the dose?
