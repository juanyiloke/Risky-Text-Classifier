The fight to reclaim your lifeFor me personally the doctors could only do so much, I understand it's like this for many long term sufferers. Before I decided to take action, I researched on the internet for several years, forums, boards, info sites and I was able to apply lots of this to my own personal experiences.I am not cured or fully recovered, I have my own personal perspective and philosophy about mental illness. I know how it feels to be helpless and feel the hopelessness of long term illness. I know what it's like to want to travel back in time and try to undo things in your past.You can embrace the doctors treatment and also adapt your management, so it becomes more about managing your life, not just focusing on the illness, not just fighting to survive day to day.These sort of sites gave me some good insight into how I was thinking and feeling, so I am attempting to pay it back, by sharing my opinion.It took decades of having my life piece by piece crumbling, there was very little left except the seemingly never ending pain, which I decided to capture and harness like a sunbeam. You can get a working plan happening from the sages on google and your own experience. If possible try to do it earlier on, after 1st episode if possible, the docs are also a good resource.
