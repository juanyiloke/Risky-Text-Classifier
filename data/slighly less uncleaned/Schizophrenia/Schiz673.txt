ÊThe thought of therapy now makes me very nauseated.I haven't posted in a while. I found a t who takes both of my insurances and is in my city and she has experience with schizophrenic patients. I emailed her but reading the email back saying that she accepts both and to call and set up an appointment, my anxiety and everything got so high that I've been extremely sick feeling. I'm terrified it's a trick to get me to say things that will somehow get me trapped inside of a psych ward or worse. My xanax isn't even help calm me down. I tried to eat and couldn't take more than 2 bites before I was dry heaving to the point where tears were running down my face and my head was pulsing with pain. I told my best friend, who is a psychology major, and she told me that if it affects me that much, that I shouldn't go. But that's my last option. No medicine works. I've read articles saying therapy helps more than meds. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what to think right now.ÊWhat should I do?Ê
