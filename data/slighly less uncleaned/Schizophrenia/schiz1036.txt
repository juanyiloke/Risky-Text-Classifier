ÊI Am So Scared !!!!!For the past 6 years I have been living with Paranoid Schizophrenia and I am terrified with the ideation someones using magic against me and I am scared of occult type end of the world paranoia and dillusions, all day long I see visions that shock and scare me and I'm so scared of dying and I've tried to kill myself 25+ times and I've been arrested and in jail for many chemical imbalances and God's obvious wrath over things that aren't my fault in the first place ... When the dillusions could be about something like religion how do I differentiate between the dillusions and the truth about what I'm experiencing? I am TERRIFIED of hell and my father in heaven - Basically I'm about to crack with these theologian ideals - What do I do to make the terrorfying visions stop??? I hear voices and I feel so scared ... Any help dealing with such and unhealthy obsession of God?
