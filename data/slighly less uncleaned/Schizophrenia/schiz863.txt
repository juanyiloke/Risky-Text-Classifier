hi to everyone, ive just found this forum and id just like to ask a few questions about my condition. i was a heavy user of ecstasy for 2years back in my uni days 2000/2001 and then since i stopped i started to notice my social anxiety where i found it hard to be round people without feeling paranoia and thinking that i have nothing to say etc. about 2004 and i split up with my girlfriend, left my job etc and decided to see the doctor about it. i was put on some anti depressants but they didnt sem to work at all. then i read an interesting book about nutrition etc and it helped me out loads. i started by taking fish oil tablets (efalex 4 a day) and everything was great again. fininhsed my uni, got a flat etc etc. i still noticed my paranoia and my wired social thing every now and then but i was more then able to live with it until i noticed the voice (my voice) which seems to say things every now and then, and i have visions and doing things to ppl which i dont want to do!! well my paranioa is back bigtime, im straggling to concentrate and i think im getting the symptoms of schizophrenia. my question is are there any old ecstasy users on here who may be going throu the same thing? if so what treatments did you find most effective? the fish oil worked find for me for about 3years but now im trying vitamin b and 5htp. i have also found that alcohol works completely for paranoia but i know this isnt the answer. thanks for you time
