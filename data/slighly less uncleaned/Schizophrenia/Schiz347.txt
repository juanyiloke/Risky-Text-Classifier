I developed diabetes over year after gaining 50lbs on risperdal. It has been a battle. I also suffer now from back aches from carrying the extra weight. In ten years of being on antipsychotics I have gained 100 lbs. Now my metabolism is very slow and an extreme amount of movement is needed to stoke the "fire". My eyesight has become poorer, although I am not sure how much is age and how much is medication. My sleep cycle is off. Antipsychotics have done a number on me, I could go on, but I'd like to hear from you.
