ÊMelatoninI seem to remember several people in the sz and psychosis forum mentioning they use melatonin (for sleep, I assume).Since my son has gone off his AP, his old sleep problems are back. He's been using olanzapine PRN to help him sleep. He was getting a little desperate, so finally I suggested melatonin. He took it last night, and it worked.I told him to buy the lowest dose he could find, look for a brand that was made in a laboratory, and take it one hour before bedtime.Any other tips? Any problems we should be aware of?I'm going to ask him to tell his pdoc at his next appointment. I've suggested he see a sleep specialist, but he's refused, saying it would be too much of a hassle.
