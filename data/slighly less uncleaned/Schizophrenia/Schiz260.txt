A few weeks ago I admitted myself to a place called River Edge. I had to lie to say I was detoxing just to get in-patient treatment for what I feared was schizophrenia. It is in every generation except my mother. I begged to be admitted after my episodes becoming an every day occurrence. Seeing, hearing, and feeling things that aren't there. After being started on a low dose of risperdal, I lied and said i hallucinated less just to get out on my scheduled date. The help there is non-existant. (on another note they nearly starved me by feeding me mainly green beans and sometimes a beef patty bc I am gluten and lactose intolerant).I was there for a full week, locked inside with all us other unwell people and those detoxing. After a long week of poor care for patients, and being denied my anxiety meds a few times, they finally diagnosed me with sever bipolar disorder, severe anxiety disorder, psychosocial disorder, with psychotic features. When I first got there they diagnosed me with schizophrenia, but then changed it to all those I previously listed.I am currently on 1 mg of risperdal, once a day. Along with an anxiety med every 12 hours, and a depression med at bedtime.ÊI still hallucinate constantly. It is making me hate living. It is very very upsetting.I have been on y meds for less than a month probably, but shouldn't they help at least a little?I am tired of losing grip on reality, I would do anything to make the hallucinations stop. I am desperate. With my physical health being very horrible bc of many conditions, as well as all my mental ones, this is too much to handle. Is stress making it worse? When will it get better?
