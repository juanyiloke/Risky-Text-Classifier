ÊIs misdiagnosis possible?So here's my story. In short.I had one psychotic episode in April 2010. I tried to convince my pdoc I had issues with my mood but she wasn't taking any notice. It was only when I sought a private opinion did they say I was actually schizoaffective. Anyway, couldn't afford to continue with private treatment so went back to the same NHS pdoc who insisted it was schizophrenia. The diagnosis for me was really important as I felt my treatment was not right. So I insisted I thought I had mood issues and they insisted it was a denial process as part of schiz. That whole thing traumatised me and put me of pdocs for good. The pdoc discharged me back to my GP after 3 years. But then about a year later I had a mood episode that my GP actually witnessed when she tried to take me off the AP. So now even the NHS pdocs say it's schizoaffective (the bipolar kind).ÊI still feel this is the wrong diagnosis. I still feel in denial. How do I overcome this?
