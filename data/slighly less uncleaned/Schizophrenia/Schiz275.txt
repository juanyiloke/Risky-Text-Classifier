Lately, I've been working in the yard, with my dad and brother. Yesterday was Sunday so I especially worked in the yard.Due to that, I picked up a stick, one those poles that you get from OSH or the Home Depot, and pointed it at my brother.Now, I feel like I've got to do something bad to my brother. I don't know if it is a hallucination or just some random thoughts in my head, but now I feel as if my brother has become my enemy. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel as if I don't know what's going on. The last time I felt like harming my brother was in February and I felt so weird at the time that I just couldn't explain what was going on. I was picking up hair from the trash cans. I was doing some random weird ???? from the trash can.I have no idea what's going on. If anyone can help me, please reply. Otherwise, I want to be hospitalized again.
