I have noticed that my sister criticises me relentlessly - but in a way that I have not really noticed before. Everything she says about me - comments about me - to me directly or about me indirectly to other people have a negative connotation and it has only been from attending an evening class and having another student who studied mathematics - that she said a part of studying mathematics involved analysing past famous philosophers who have been heavily criticised due to them challenging concieved and accepted scientific theories eg. how the universe functions. This would totally explain why my sister is very anti me doing anything that involves communicating with people I don't know - eg. new evening classes, getting a job etc because she's very afraid of how I might react to criticism if i showed my lack of scientific expertise or basic accepted ideas of knowledge. This would totally explain why i find it very difficult to be around her because anything i say now - it's almost like she has stopped listening to me and doesn't find any of my ideas fresh and exciting now. Instead she goes out of her way to be very critical and negative in all i do and say. My parents think she's great because she finds working easy and she's a complete show off in front of them. I just wish I could be trained to do a job and find a work environment where people have patience and where the social side and being able to communicate is only a very small part of the job and where accuracy and key skills is more important - rather than having to always justify yourself to people every minute of the day within a job.
