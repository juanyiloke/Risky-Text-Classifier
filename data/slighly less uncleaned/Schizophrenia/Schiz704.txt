ÊI think I'm beginning to have an episode....I went to see my psychiatrist last Wednesday. Before last Wednesday I had been feeling somewhat better (less depressed) so I only had good things to tell my psychiatrist... The couple days before I saw my Pdoc my hallucinations had been slightly more frequent.. I mentioned that I was still having hallucinations- but that they weren't as evil/malicious towards me. She increased my seroquel XR from 400 to 600 mg. And said I could continue to take 100mg of regular seroquel during the day if i needed it. I usually need it. Sense I saw my Pdoc I have become much more socially withdrawn, my hallucinations are becoming more angry at me. They are urging me to hurry up and finish my plans. They are telling me that if I don't hurry I will fail at my mission and my death will have been for nothing. I have also begun to have sort of paranoid thinking. I am usually somewhat paranoid, particularly around people, but this is different. Its like all of my thoughts are consumed with people wanting to kill me, people controlling my thoughts, people controlling my actions and behaviors.... it's kind of weird. I have begun to find it difficult to focus, and ive started to get really angry at even little things- like really irritable to the point where i get annoyed if people try to talk to me without me initiating conversation first...... These are familiar feelings, I felt them in my last episode... So I am kind of concerned that i might be starting to have another episode... except this time im not manic and having an episode so its a little weird for me. I am also not depressed. The seroquel seems to have leveled out my emotions... so its really confusing that i would be having a psychotic episode without being on a mood extreme...
