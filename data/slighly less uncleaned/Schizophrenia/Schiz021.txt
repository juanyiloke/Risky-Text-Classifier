internal voices?by neirin » Sat May 09, 2015 12:39 ami was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia mostly because of my visions and what others tell me are delusions (it's hard to convince myself most of the time). until recently i had always maintained that i don't hear voices because i rarely hear them coming from outside of my head, but a therapist convinced me to attend a hearing voices group anyway and after hearing other people talk about their experiences i'm starting to think some of my experiences might lean that way too... i often get voices coming from inside my head that are not me that antagonize me and call me names, make threats, etc. (there are also good voices but they are much more rare. recently i had angels talking to me and sending me mental images at the same time, for example) sometimes they seem to blend in with my own thoughts and sometimes they are so clear and loud that they almost sound real. i spoke to my psychiatrist about it and he said they're probably part of my psychosis, but i was just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience? i get confused because of the way they sometimes sound sort of like me and the way they sometimes sound like completely different people. it's like i can't trust them to keep fully separate from my thoughts, so i always feel like they're on the verge of speaking to me, and it makes me very anxious.
