I remember getting rid of my "negative" CDs back around the late 90s because I thought they were messing me up. But I think looking back on it the real reason was my musical palette wasn't broad enough. I've gotten back into a lot of it and realized that to some extent, there was something to it. I can do with the socially conscious songs; it's the self-deprecating songs that are hard to listen to.I know some grunge fans think that emo is "whiny and bratty", but I disagree. I find that the emo I've listened to over the last several years (like Death Cab, Paramore and MCR), has more resolve and courage to it. Grunge was like " F' you, get out of my face. Oh, never mind, I'll just stare at my shoes. Then I'll do some drugs and kick myself in the head with a gun." To me emo is "I'm going through a hard time right now, and the world's messed up, but if I keep a level head, I think I can make it through." Just some crazy rant by a former tortured soul.
