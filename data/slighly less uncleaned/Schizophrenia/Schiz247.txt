Im just curious to see if anyone else has this problem. It's also extremely difficult to describe, I've had to recreate the effect to get my point across to the docs. They don't seem too concerned. I am unable to find a true description online but I'd have to put it in the same category as an anxiety attack. I can feel its onset before it happens. a simple string of agitating outcomes brings it into full effect, and it doesn't happen too often. Seems to be a bigger problem when Im completely alone (I think I have a slight control over it when Im around other people but when Im alone I have no fear of embarrassment) Itll completely take over my body, Ill drop whatever Im holding like my tablet or phone and get completely rigid. shaking. grimacing. my arms raise up toward my chest and every single muscle in my body gets so tense it usually leaves me completely drained after it passes. my teeth clench shut. Im still completely aware of my surroundings though so I don't think its any kind of seizure. I've been searching for answers by looking up example of like agitated catatonia but it doesn't quite seem to fit. I do however get totally catatonic as a separate problem. Im just looking to see if anyone can relate and what they do to prevent it's onset. is there a name I can put to this? I don't hyperventilate. If anything... I don't think I breathe at all while its happening. Thank god it only lasts between a few seconds and a few minutes before im released from its grasp.
