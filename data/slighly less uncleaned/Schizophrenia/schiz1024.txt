 anti psychotic med help..anyone have any luck with not gaining weight on an anti psychotic medication? Ive been on many but they either don't work, stop working or cause a lot of weight gain and increased sugar levels. i am starting with a new psychiatrist in a week and a half and want to be able to walk in with an idea of medicines to avoid. i know zyprexa wont work for me. it caused me to gain a lot of weight in a matter of weeks which wasnt good for my overall health. any input is greatly appreciated.
