ÊFilms about SchizophreniaI made this list probably about 1-2 years ago. Im making it again for people who are new.Here are films about schizophrenia or having to do with schizophrenia. In order from the oldest movie to the newest one. Most of them are in my personal library too. Ive made the links clickable. They should all take you to the International Movie Database which tells you everything about the movie that youll ever want to really know and even each movie has its own message board at the bottom of the site where people can discuss the film.
