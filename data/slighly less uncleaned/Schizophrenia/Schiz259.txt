I read my novella and edited it too. it's 31k words long. it concerns mental illness, but there's a story behind it. it's a fiction novella but based on my life...there are fictitious characters but it's roughly based on me as the main character. there are a lot of themes in the story and twists. i sent it to my parents and my sister (who's an english major) and now i'm waiting for my next move but hope to get it published. i've wanted to be a writer since I was 19 (I'm 25 a week from today) but have given up many times. I couldn't even write more than a sentence for the past 6 months, but on sunday i sat down and wrote, and i wrote, and i wrote, and i wrote. until I finished writing my 31k word novella...in 4 days! one of the lines in the book is to never give up and you should never give up. i hope to continue my education and pursue even greater endeavors in the world of writing. peace
