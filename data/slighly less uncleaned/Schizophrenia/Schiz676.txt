Êive received drawings from voicesback in 2012 somewhere, i received 2 drawings on 2 different things. 1 was a kleenex with my name written in pink under my bed. second was a square drawing of round faces depicting the terrible voice attacks i was getting before a hospitalization. that was found in a diary of my roommates who is a wican, she knew it belonged to me because i was telling her what i was going through. its an amazing proof to me that the voices are something real. Well today outside i heard the female voice say she was making a drawing of me. I put an old cig butt in my pocket, she started saying she was ruining the picture. then a male voice chimed in saying he was interested in me. Im not that shocked..ive delt with this interpersonal communication using telepathy for years now.
