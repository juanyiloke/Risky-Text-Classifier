Êi am in a dream world (nightmare)HOW does this all happen????? i mean i GET that the auditory hallucinations or visuals that aren't there could be schizophrenia.ÊBut HOW do the things in my environment change depending on what i am thinking.these are REAL things and i have reality checked and others see and hear them too but say they are not connected to me in anyway.I KNOW that they are. things just don't suddenly make banging sounds every time you have a certain thought or emotion. my mind in very aware of my surroundings because it NEEDs to know what is happening and why. and statistically these thing just don't add up. how can i prove it to myself and to others? what do i have to do? talk every thought out loud and carry a recorder to listen to the sounds later? and then there are the visual things in my environment that react to my thoughts as well!can someone out there.. ANYONE out there PLEASE try and explain to me HOW this stuff is possible in a logical way. and go into depth about it too, because i have heard all of the generic things like, " i am just imagining that these things are connected to me" but i am not....
