I must have mentioned this before on here but I wanted to hear your experiences.When I first came into contact with the mental health services for my psychosis I was with Early Intervention. I had a psychiatrist, a CPN and an employment specialist. The CPN and employment specialist were brilliant. But the pdoc? OMG. I would tell her I felt depressed and manic and she'd say I was in denial of schiz so I was trying to make up symptoms since I wanted to have bipolar. So she wouldn't treat me for those "symptoms" that she thoguth i was faking. Eventually, I got discharged from her care since early intervention only see you for 3 years. Later I did get diagnosed with schizoaffective, bipolar but it was a struggle to be heard.
