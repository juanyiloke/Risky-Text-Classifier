Anyone diagnosed with both autism and schizophrenia?by rhyanen » Thu May 14, 2015 4:51 pmHi, I am new here, mother to a 14 year old that is in a prodromal psychosis state. He was also diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. He is very high functioning and has always been an honor roll student, but over the last 3 months, he has had a deterioration in his academic functioning and stopped going to school due to extreme fear and paranoia. He is now agoraphobic and will only leave the house to attend medical appointments and psychiatric appointments because he does want to feel better and get help. He is having some mild hallucinations as well, but not very frequently. He has many of the so called "negative" symptoms of psychosis.I know that there is a lot of overlap between autism and childhood onset schizophrenia in the way of symptoms. But how likely is it that my son could have both? Or does it just sound like a case of misdiagnosis early on?I'd love to get input from anyone that has been diagnosed with both autism and schizophrenia, or anyone who has a child where there was a misdiagnosis.Thanks,rhyanen
