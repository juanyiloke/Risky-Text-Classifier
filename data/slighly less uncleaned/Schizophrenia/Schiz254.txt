When I was hospitized in 1981 there was this huge guy who arrived after me. It was a large hospital and I saw him around. One day I was out on the back lawn and he walked right up to me and got in my face for no reason. He had a paper cup with a little Kool-Aid in it and he poured it on my head and threatened me. He was big and looked like an ex-football player and I got scared so I didn't hit him. I learned years later why he did this. But the funny thing is that after that incident he was really friendly to me and we got on good terms.But the hospital let certain people keep cars behind the hospital in a parking lot. And this guy had a pick-up truck parked there. I was still a little wary of him and one day he came up to me and he said, "Hey, me and a couple guys are going to drive up to the hills to just walk around. You want to come"? But I thought he was asking me so he could take me out and kill me. So I told him this and he turned and walked away without saying a word. I think he thought I was a wimp for being so afraid. I was just paranoid.But the funny thing is, now this exact same guy lives in my apartment complex! And we get along fine. In fact I saw him yesterday and said "Hi".My other neigbor talked to him and the guy told him about the Kool-Aid incident and it turns out the guy wanted to fight me in the hospital because for some reason his voices told him I was going to kill him.
