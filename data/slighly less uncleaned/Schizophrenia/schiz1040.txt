Schizophrenia and PubertyI'm a teen. Odd I know but I had Schizophrenia for a couple months,I try to tell my "Guardians" but they just say "Oh You're just dreaming"."You just we're Tired." I see bad things when I wake up...a Spider in front of myface...my worst nightmare a tall pitch black figure,they become flashes when I wake up. Or when I walk in the House at night. I feel I am always watched andI go into Isolation more often then usual. I hear sounds as well. Since I deeply fear that I may wake up and end up fainting because I saw a Figure that wasn't actually there. My Best Friend Thinks i'm just Crazy. It feels when I escape a Nightmare I then live one. It seems as if no one believes me but I have mostof the Symptoms,Isolated,sounds,delusions,illus ions,and a false sense of security. I just woke up and decided I need to find a way. The Only Ones whobelieve me are my Step Dad and Mother,but they have no control of me.Only My Father and Step M. What should I Do Please Help.
