 getting helpmy city has an early psychosis intervention program that you can refer yourself to and after a lot of stressing and pacing and debating i finally called them and the line was busy and it said to leave a message but i had no idea what to say so i panicked and hung up now i don't know what to do i should've left my number and asked them to call me back but i hate the phone so much it makes me so nervousi would just call back but i don't have the direct number, i have to go through the building's receptionist or w/e and i don't want to have to they close in 45 minutes i just wanted to get an appointment made for an assessment or something
