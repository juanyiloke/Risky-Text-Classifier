Ive got a question for you.....Its going to sound completely barmy!!!!!!! Alot of you will probably not like me after I tell you this but I had an abortion a coulple of years ago.....I know I shouldnt have done it and I regreted it since the minute I woke up from the operating table. Well, it affected me very badly and I have never and will never be able to get over it....ÊWell, one morning I woke up, I layed in bed for a while when I heard a noise at the end of the bed, I looked down and I saw a child at the end of the bed it was a boy very fair hair, he was just a toddler maybe 2 or 3 years old, he wasnt wearing anything, he looked at me and I looked at him and he ran out of the bedroom door...I even heard his footsteps as he ran. I got out of bed, ran to the door and looked round the corner the baby wasnt there. I woke up my partner and cried, I told him that I was going mad and told him what I saw.ÊIt was crazy...Large as life!!!! It was so strange that not only did I see the child but I heard his footsteps.ÊWhat happened to me..I dont understand? Was it because I was so devistated by what I had done?
