I lost so much timeMy posts are preachy, because I know some of you are still in the earlier stages of your mental illness journey. I know I can't get back the decades I lost, you don't want to live like this for many years. My soul feels drained from trying to find ways to escape this hellish nightmare. This became my life, the mental illness defined me. It's too late in some respects the best years of my life are gone. I can't time machine, I can't magic pen (men in black), I can't undo and I can't recreate the past. You have all the resources, use your doctors, don't listen to some old burn outs on the internet, we are just a bunch of know it alls, who all claim to have had the most pain and stories to back it up.You're reading this right now, you can change, you still have a choice.I hope it doesn't come down to primal evolution, adapt or die.
