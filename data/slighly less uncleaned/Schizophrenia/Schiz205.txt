Hi Nick. Sorry to bother you again about this but my cat is not doing so well. Took her to the vet again today, they gave her a shot and are increasing by 4X for a while her daily prednisone and increasing by2X her daily terbutaline. They still don't say use inhaler on her though. Any at home type remedies to help it not flare up as much? She does great in the winter but in the summer ends up so sick. Vet said she "can't promise' this will work but hopes so and wants her back in a week. Neverminding I can't afford all this but doing the best as I can.
