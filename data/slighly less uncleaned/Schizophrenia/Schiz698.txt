ÊStarting dose of seroquel of 800mg?I decided to get back on a AP. Seroquel was the only one who did anything for my negative symptoms but nothing for my hallucinations or delusions. But it does help my paranoia, which has been super bad lately. I'm down to 128 or less (I haven't checked my weight in over a week.) and gaining weight would actually be nice. My last dose was 800mg. My doctor asked me what dose I want to start out on and I said 800mg so I don't have to spend forever being tired and get accumulated to the full dose in a shorter time period. Has anyone else ever done anything like that? If so, how was it?
