Early warning signs of psychosisby ZonedOut » Tue Jan 20, 2015 3:42 pmI'm currently in my early 20s, diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder. I'm already in treatment because I've experienced a notable decline in functioning over the past 2-3 years, causing me to quit my job and to retreat from the outside world even more than I used to. It has become increasingly difficult to get myself going, especially on tasks requiring much cognitive effort. I'm getting more and more sensitive, nervous, irritable, distrusting and overly cautious. I also had visual hallucinations on two separate occasions this year (which I recently mentioned in some other post on this forum). I'm getting increasingly more concerned I might be developing schizophrenia. My psychiatrist noted a 'possible schizophrenic development' in a recent diagnostic report, but strangely enough never talked to me about it.
