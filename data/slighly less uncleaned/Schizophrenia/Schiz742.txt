ÊAm I really sick?I've been in and out of hospital with hearing voices and depression a lot of my life and it was diagnosed as "drug induced psychosis".ÊI'm currently taking 100mg of Solian/amisulpride and I'm perfectly well the last 4 years, just a little bit angry sometimes at the world but who isn't right.Only problem is that the medication's side effects are bad - my Prolactin is very high and leading to some overweight issues and no period.Êmy question:Is 100mg dose really doing anything for me? or is it just a placebo?ÊMy doctor wants to put me on Quetiapine/Seroquel for less side effects and suggested a dose of 25mg on an ongoing basis (never raising it higher than that)but I am reading that this medication also will raise Prolactin and has possibly more side effects than Solian/Amisulpride.I have read about a drug called "Latuda" which does not seem to have the side effects as much but i believe it is not available in Ireland yet but I could go to the UK for treatment.I would like to go for CBT treatment ... would this help someone that suffers from voices?ÊAny info is greatly appreciated. There is so much stigma in this country about mental health, it is hard to get info and you are treated like an idiot by the doctors because you suffer from poor mental health..
