When I think of my past relations with women and sexual imagery, I feel really bad about it. Even though I've matured over the last several years, I am very aware of my own tendencies. But, I've come to realize that every man no matter how refined, intelligent and mature he is, deals with his own misogynous tendencies. Do you agree? The reason I bring it up is because I'm really starting to become romantically and sexually lonely lately and just want to bite the bullet and talk to women. It's just if I start talking to pretty store clerks and ask one for a date, I'm afraid of looking like a creep. I know deep down I'm being too hard on myself. I'm just going to have to push myself if that's what I really want. It's just that simple.I remember getting rid of my "negative" CDs back around the late 90s because I thought they were messing me up. But I think looking back on it the real reason was my musical palette wasn't broad enough. I've gotten back into a lot of it and realized that to some extent, there was something to it. I can do with the socially conscious songs; it's the self-deprecating songs that are hard to listen to.I know some grunge fans think that emo is "whiny and bratty", but I disagree. I find that the emo I've listened to over the last several years (like Death Cab, Paramore and MCR), has more resolve and courage to it. Grunge was like " F' you, get out of my face. Oh, never mind, I'll just stare at my shoes. Then I'll do some drugs and kick myself in the head with a gun." To me emo is "I'm going through a hard time right now, and the world's messed up, but if I keep a level head, I think I can make it through." Just some crazy rant by a former tortured soul.
