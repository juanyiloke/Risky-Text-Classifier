Half the battle was won after I decided that some 'visions' and 'voices' I had were result of telepathic transmissions.I wouldn't preach that is exactly what they are but many have claimed such before me.Accepting that strange sciences may be at play in our world and that no matter what you know or say everything will still be the 'same as it ever was' lifted a massively heavy burden from my shoulders.I continue on with a stranger perception of life but one that no longer upsets me and I continue on more content now only worrying about down-to-Earth concerns (work, physical health, etc) that are more imminent.I know for many it's not so much anxiety concerning epistemology as it is just trying to quite down their head garbage but I find Risperdone, meditation, rest and the ability to accept and let go makes occurrences less random. I usually only get them if I'm pissed off about something (stress) or during a contiguous state (meditating or falling asleep). Meditational occurrences don't bother me as I am expecting them and in control of them during those times.When this all started I thought that I had gone stark raving mad and the resulting dread caused me to chase my tail, ironically, for years.
