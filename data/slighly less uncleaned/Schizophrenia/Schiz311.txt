When you get asked about paranoia the assumption is that you have enough contact with others to have definite non paranoid and paranoid interactions with others. However what if your face to face interactions with others are almost non existent and your only reference point is how you feel online when interacting with others. Mention your paranoia online and it seems to be a dismissive case of "Oh that" as if so long as it's not face to face it's not a problem.The trouble is it is a problem when it leads you to thinking of disengaging from the2 D interactions you have with others and you have to resist the urge to say X and Y are fakes and here for ulterior motives because you are so suspicious.I am sure the irregular sleep patterns have caught up with me. Something tells me I am not right . Woke up this morning with a headache and feeling cold. Felt cold on getting up quite a lot recently. I know the other day I put on a jacket to go outside because I felt chilly but when I got outside it was warm.I keep thinking I have some syndrome that is messing up my mind and body that accounts for the up 3-4 hours/to bed for 2-3 hours cycle during the day. It would be nice to go to bed at night and sleep 4-5 hours wake briefly and then sleep 3-4 more hours and wake up feeling ok or even invigorated, without the urges to go to bed to sleep during the day.I am sure it is the excessive sleep during the day that is messing with my body and my mind.
