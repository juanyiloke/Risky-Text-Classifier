Êhelp me :(Recently ive been really worried that i have acuired schizophrenia. Not sure if im just being anxious or what. So over the past few months ive been feeling really weird. Physically sick, ive thought that ive had diabetes, was having a stroke, having blood clots. Basically i thought i was going to die. Now i was still feeling very weird so googled for mental symptoms and schizophrenia came up and i read over it. Ive been having trouble sleeping recently and it freaked me out.I read over more common symptoms such as believing you have powers, paranoia, delusional etc also read many stories upon how people believe they were speaking to god etc. I have never heard voices or seen things. but i do get really weird thoughts such as what if im being poisoned. I dont really believe the thoughts but theyre there. Like it wont stop me from eating or drinking anything. I also have been having alot of de ja vu lately and one of the thoughts that enters my mine is " am i psychic?" These thoughts really scare me. Ive also been thinking of my past alot recently. Like when i was a kid. Almost as if im convinced that ive always had schizophrenia or something. Remember being really freaked out by movies, video games, cartoons. They gave me weird feelings and i dont know what these feelings were. Its like my brain is trying to figure it out. I similarly did this when i thought i had diabetes trying to remember symptoms. But i had my blood sugar tested and it was fine. At times i randomly feel like im gonna start hallucinating or feel like im being delusional. I dont know what to do do you guys think i have schizophrenia?
