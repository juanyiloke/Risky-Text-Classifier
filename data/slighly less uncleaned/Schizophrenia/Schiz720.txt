ÊPsychological & Emotional Abusei feel that there has been a lot of psychological & emotional abuse in certain ways within the family dynamics.ÊMy family dynamics have been dysfunctional. It's hard to try & sum it all up & explain it all, with everything that has gone on. i feel very much that a lot psychological & emotional needs were not met growing up & that certain family members were psychologically & emotionally abusive. It was in ways a toxic environment.ÊThe wider society - this culture also seems psychologically & emotionally abusive in ways. As does the schooling system - some of it worse than others.ÊHow much of all this has been a part of my diagnosis of schizophrenia?ÊWhen i first experienced severe psychosis, the response from the system was violent, & i feel i've been abused by the psychiatric system. In the 25 years since first being in hospital, i've felt a lot of trivialisation, blame, invalidation, unacknowledgement & denial.ÊMy mum was loving & caring. She went through a very hard time during the pregnancy of me & my bro, & a difficult birth Ð going through a bad divorce from my father, who was violent. She struggled a lot during our early years, bringing up 2 kids on her own. From when I was age 3 she started a long term 34 year relationship with a man I didn't get on with.ÊMy twin brother has been in addiction for 30 years. I was also in addiction 17 years, but have been clean & sober 13 years.ÊI've been single 16 years & living alone 13 years. I've had quite an isolated & lonely life. I've always argued a lot with my brother, & for the past 4 years my mum has had Alzheimers. The family dynamics have always been hard. There is no other close family.ÊI haven't had much success with psychologists/therapists, & I was discharged again from mental health services over 2 years ago. I have made a lot of progress but also feel that I can't more fully resolve certain things. People don't appear able to really understand my experiences.ÊI've posted a lot on-line over the past 10 years, & generally people are OK & there are some good people, but i've also been attacked a lot. People seem to have a lot of anger, hate & blame in them. Some days I think a majority of people have Devils in them. That is the way I see it.ÊI try to let go & be accepting & grateful, but certain things are very hard to more fully let go of. I also hate this civilisation/society Ð it appear to me to be barbaric & very backward, especially in the ways people are treated, especially those in need of help, & who are vulnerable. A lot of the time I want to hide away from it all. There is currently a big agenda in the UK against the sick & disabled, with a lot of cuts to the benefits system. It has caused me a lot of worry & concern, as i'm dependent on benefits. I find it very hard to have any hope about the future Ð have not felt well & had a very hard year this year.
