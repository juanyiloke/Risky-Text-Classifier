Drug addiction and schizophreniai am curious - what have your experiences with alcohol and psychoactive drugs? i am not meaning to be judgmental, i am just wondering. i know for me my disease manifested far before i started experimenting with substances, but drugs later definitely exacerbated things. i was addicted to cocaine because of how tired my meds made me, and addicted to benzos and opiates to try to deny the reality of having a chronic illness. i have been clean and sober now for 2 years. narcotics anonymous saved my life, truly. but i'm not saying that's for everyone.i know many people that can do drugs without abusing them, without betraying themselves fully. i am just not one of those people. with my schizophrenia and my addict mentality it's just no good.you?
