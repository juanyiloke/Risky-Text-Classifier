ÊHow do you cope with cognitive issues?Alright, this is the last thread I'll make tonight. I promise. But tomorrow I may come back with an intriguing philosophical question we can all discuss. I think that we would all enjoy that.ÊAnyway, this is a mundane "help me!" thread, much like the one I asked about avolition.I've been having a really bad time with my concentration, memory, and processing speed. It is very distressing to me, as I used to pride myself on being a fairly intelligent person.I posted a thread on this issue in the general mental health forum a few weeks ago:Cognitive Issuesbut I didn't get many replies. So if you have any idea what I can do to get around this, or personal stories of how you've dealt with this, that would be very helpful.Thanks so much!
