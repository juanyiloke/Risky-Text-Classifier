 Am I Schizophrenic or is it Just Another Obsession?I'm new to posting on this site, but I do read it a lot on the internet. I should just start by saying that I've had ocd for my entire life. Lately, I have developed a fear of being schizophrenic. I know that you're going to say that if I was schizophrenic I wouldn't be able to tell that I was, but that's just not enough to convince me. I researched the symptoms online, and I don't really have anything except for the fact that I sometimes have conversations with myself (and obviously obsessive-compulsive "tendencies"). I do read other questions similar to mine, but just reading them doesn't seem to be enough to convince me. So I had to get a straight up answer. Today just wasn't a good day for me. I can't sleep and it's 11:30 at night. I'm really sorry but I desperately need an answer.
