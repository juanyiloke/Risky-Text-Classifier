I just want someone to talk to. Who isn't going to tell me it's going to get better, someone who isn't going to talk me out of stuff, someone who will keep there spiritual advice and life experiences to themselves. that sounds mean but I honestly just want someone to talk to about dark And stupid stuff. I don't need someone who is going to get offended by my jokes about a degree in women studies and I'll listen to their jokes. I need someone who doesn't have time for what's going on because it's way Better to laugh at it.I'm not getting any better, I'm not trying to be a medicated zombie either.ÊI have the mind I was born with, this is me. I want a friend who is okay with me and I'll be okay with them.ÊThat's all.ÊI have my boyfriend, who is the greatest but we don't have the same since of humor.When people other than my boyfriend (on occasion) touch me, my skin starts burning to the point I start to cry. It feels like pressure is on the spot whereever they touched me. It can be family or just random people, it is the worst.ÊI'm in my room now trying not to scream bloody murder after my baby cousin kept grabbing my arm for no reason. No I'm not on any medicine anymore, none of it was really doing any good.Buspar normally helps me calm down, so I'm going to take a couple.ÊDoes this happen to anyone else?
