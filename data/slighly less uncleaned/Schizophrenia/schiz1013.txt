Possible RecoveryDepending on your definition of recovery, I believe the mechanism which we call schizophrenia is essential for survival. If you extend your focus to the body/brain/person, it is a very complicated interlinked system that took millions of years of evolving through harsh conditions.If you can adjust to the limitations, there is no big problem, kind of like a person learning to live in a wheelchair or becoming blind.I am still alive today and still myself, it was very hard to accept the limitations when in my early 20s. Twenty somethings know it all !!Whether it be a disease or survival mech, it's irreversible, unless they make back to the future 4. Everybody hurts, but not all the time, they will cure you and you have a heart attack from working 60hrs a week.
