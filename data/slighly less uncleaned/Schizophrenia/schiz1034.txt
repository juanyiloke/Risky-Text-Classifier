Medication and the voices?Dear all,I am a paranoid schizophrenic diagnosed in 2005. I have suffered a mulitude of symptoms and have been placed, most recently, on Abilify for my illness. I am currently taking 20mg a day. Lately, I have been experiencing auditory hallucinations, particularly at night. I would probably classify these voices as benevolent in that they do not impart any negative messages on me. They simply repeat my thoughts aloud. This is quite distracting and affects the clarity of my thoughts. It is a single voice and is feminine in identity. I would like to be rid of this voice but have several anxieties regarding the issue of changing or even adding anti-psychotic medication.I am aware that the scientific fratrenity does not really understand voices. Anti-psychotic medication and the dopamine hypothesis is just a shot in the dark. My question is whether anyone has experienced remission for voices under medication? Which medication is most effective for the voices and how long does it take for the voice to subside? Also, is there any other means of tackling the voices?Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
