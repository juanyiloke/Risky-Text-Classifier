My Whole Life Has Been a Delusion.by Thedevilwearsasmile » Tue Mar 31, 2015 2:00 amIn therapy my therapist asked me if I often question myself or what is real or not real, my boyfriend says he noticed I do this a lot too, I ask other people how they see it, or even sometimes, if something I see is really there, or if they heard that.... I have been living a very peaceful, normal life... I am on meds and I noticed that when I get stressed out I start to get sick, how I deal with stress is to be super hypersexual... I have not had any real problems in 6 months, but the other night I was really stressed out... I've been going through a very hard time dealing with the DHHS and with a stalker neighbor... I could not sleep because I could hear a lot of people whispering, and in the background was a lot of music, but it was 1am in the morning... No one in my building would do that, when I asked if anyoe else heard it, they all told me "no". So, I guess it is true, it is the stress that makes me get sick, or maybe I get sick and it causes me stress, I don't know. I never knew what to believe growing up.... and at 32 I still don't know what to think. In these times all I want to do is sleep, and I can sleep for days at a time.... It is better than trying to sift through the things in and out of my head... I have also been looking behind my back a lot when I leave, doing parameter checks to make sure no one from my past has found me, I am also locking down my facebook account and a few others, because I think something is going to happen.... Or is it all in my Mind?
