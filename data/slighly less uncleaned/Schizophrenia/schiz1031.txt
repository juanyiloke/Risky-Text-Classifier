Project on SchizophreniaHi all,I'm currently a final year Computer Science student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Currently, I am embarking on working on a project related to schizophrenic people. Based on research, I have read that we might actually be able to predict whether a person has the possibility of getting schizophrenia in their lifetime based on the number of secondary creases on their palm prints. However, this is still very preliminary and thus we would like to focus on this area. I currently have a software program to take in the image of the palm print to determine the number of secondary creases on the person's palm, based on the image. We also have a list of image files of "normal" population, or people without schizophrenia. We would like to obtain samples of palm prints from people suffering or have known occurrences of schizophrenia. After processing their palm print images, we can then use the application to do further processing to generate reports for the "schizophrenia" population. Through the reports, we can then compare them with the "normal" population and can definitely enhance our research and understanding between the palm prints. From the reports, we can also come up with a baseline for our application to read inputs of palm print images and predict the possibility of the particular person owning that palm print,their chances of suffering from schizophrenia. In this case, prevention methods can be made early, which is definitely better than cure.If anyone is interested, it would definitely help me out a lot if you could provide me palm print images of anyone you know having or known to have schizophrenia. Also, if you have more questions on this project, please feel free to post a reply or contact me directly at jlkwek1[at]e.ntu.edu[dot]sg Many thanks in advance and would definitely appreciate a replies and feedback!
