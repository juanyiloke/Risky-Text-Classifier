 ScaredAm seeing things i have done for a long time Am on medication but i think am medication restraint with it unsure if even normal for those who have something like this I see a psych and therapist they try to help me I feel that sometimes am not really ill that am making it up Other times i feel like i am being watched by everyone and that they can read my mind and they can influence me to do bad things Am scared all the time now thinking that the things i see are after me and will hurt me I cant sleep on my own because am too scared to my therapist told me away to make myself feel safe av been trying to do it
