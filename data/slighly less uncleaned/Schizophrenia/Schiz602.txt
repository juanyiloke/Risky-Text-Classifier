ÊWhat is this...?Hello. I don't know if this is schizophrenia or what... First, I'll start by saying, I do NOT hear any voices, I know what I'm doing is abnormal... I have Agoraphobia, and anxiety/ depression issues, and several other physical health things. But as long as I remember, I will have these random bursts of talking to myself, and blurting things out. These things normally happen when I'm alone. I'll randomly go "123... ring ring, service desk here how may I help you?" or other phrases, that are randomly repetitive. I don't "hear" someone else respond at all.. It happens somewhat randomly.. and not sure why I do it...? I also have very vivid day dreams.
