Reality Testingby Abstract_Logic » Sun Dec 06, 2009 10:49 amFrom what I understand, a reality test is something you do to help yourself come to grips with reality. When you have paranoid/delusional ideations, you have to do reality testing to help remind you of what is truly real and what is all in your mind. However, this can get quite paradoxical. For instance, if you currently have a faulty perception of reality, how are you going to know what is real so that you can test it against your fantasies? Soon you'll be doing reality testing of the reality test, and reality testing of the reality test of the reality test. If you ask me, reality testing is madness. I'd like to believe my paranoid ideations are not real, but who am I to say so? Sure, I can do "reality testing" to convince myself that they aren't real, but am I just deluding and deceiving myself further?... or am I truly combatting non-real thoughts?Something to think about I suppose.
