On the verge of crackingI started hearing voices/intrusive thoughts when I was 10 years old. I had terrible thoughts. To experience those kind of voices at a young age was terrifying. The voices left and didn't resurface until several years later. When I entered high school I became depressed, and just all around self-conscious. I had no friends and everybody bullied me. I was taunted and called several names. Due to my peers calling me names I believed I was ugly all through my teenage years. I had no self-confidence in my own skin.Around that time I started hearing voices again. It was terrible. I was distraught and just down. Due to my voices coming back I checked into a mental hospital. I ended up meeting my first boyfriend and falling in love. He broke my heart several weeks after. After leaving the hospital I realized I had to give my life over to God and to keep it all in his hands. So one day I got down on my knees and prayed to God asking him to make me life better and I left everything in his hands. I was 17 then. From that day on my voices and mental instability left for several years. I became a more confident, outgoing, happy girl. I made friends, got a job, graduated from high school, met my first serious bf. Fell in love and broke up a year later. I thought things were getting better but I was wrong. After breaking up with my first serious boyfriend my mental issues came back. The voices came and started again. Today I'm 20 years old, and I'm suffering from voices and intrusive thoughts more then ever. It's worse as ever. Now I'am having thoughts <that are> really bringing me down. I can't take it. I feel like a horrible person and I feel like I'm gonna have to pay for what I think about. It's terrible and I'm suffering greatly. I just wanna have a normal life free od voices and intrusive thoughts. It's going to ruin my current relationsip, my friendships, and college education what should I do?
