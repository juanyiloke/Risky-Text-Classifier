ÊE.C.T for schizophrenia ?Does anyone know if e.c.t is suitable for schizophrenia. I am at my wits end, I am on 300mg of haldol ber month (depot) and although it seems to be working well it has given me terrible akithisia. I was hoping to start clozapine but my white cell count is too low again. I am hoping that they will let me have a couple of sessions of e.c.t to help break the cycle of voices and ruminating thoughts. I feel like i am running out of options as I have been on most drugs and they only seem to get half the job done.
