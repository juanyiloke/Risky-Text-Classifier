I have had this trouble for the past two years. Spirits of people I have heard of or know of come into my body. They come in and never leave. It feels like they come in and sit inside my body. I feel tortured all the time and they never leave. The spirits are of people that I have heard of or know of. They come in, sometimes having spirit sex with different people that I know. I have setup a system inside my head of banning them. Whenever they come in , i call them by name and tell them to leave. Even movie stars and celebrities have been inside of me. Sometimes they have hurt family members of mine and I have to make other people stop them from hurting them and me. Its a really big bother to have this problem and I want a solution to it. A spiritual worker who I have worked with told me its all happening inside my head which really seems the case.I don't know what to do to make them go away and stay out permanently. Some of the spirits even give me a taste in my mouth from their body parts. They torture me and give me nasty tastes.I am on medication and I do pray to make the situation less worse. Please somebody give me a diagnosis and answer me back about what you think. I think it is a form of schizophrenia.
