what are some fallacies and stigma have you encountered with your illness?i'm curious to see what false beliefs and judgments you've come across living with schizophrenia or knowing someone who lives with schizophrenia. here are some i've seen:1. schizophrenia is your fault. you could snap out of it if you were stronger.2. it is caused by an overactive imagination3. meds are poison and you should never take them4. schizophrenia is caused by bad parenting, such as an inconsistent mother5. it is the same thing as multiple personality disorder/dissociative identity disorder6. all people with schizophrenia are violentwhat else?
