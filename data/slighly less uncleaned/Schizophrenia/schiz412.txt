ÊNon-complianceSo I've been stable on Flupenthixol for two years after two years of paranoia and hearing people talking about in the street. However the tardive dyskenisia has been progressively worse and I am beginning to develop twitching in my face which the orphenadrine doesn't cut.I just sat down to do the metta bhavana meditation and couldn't keep still. I'm not going to comply with this medication any longer. Going to phone my CPN tomorrow when I've got credit on my phone and tell her I'm not coming in for my depot next week.Due to see the Psychiatrist on the 2nd of June so going to ask him to try me on Abilify or something./Minor Rant Over.
