Êin languagein my time i've had my anger voided, had assertivenesss training, been sexuallly abused, been empowered, been socially included, had user rights pushed, latest seems to be safeguarding me, i forgot to mention had cbt, also been respected at one pointThe only language that makes sense to me now is the language of sacking the lot of them, maybe the torys are into that, phoned some public sector worker today got treated like shit, if nothing else i can rely on the torys to treat him like shit
