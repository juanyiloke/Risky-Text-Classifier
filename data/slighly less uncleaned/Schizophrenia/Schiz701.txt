ÊHow much does medicine fix for you?I am just trying to figure out what i should expect... I am pretty new to being on AP drugs, and it doesn't really fix everything for me... I still hallucinate from time to time. (A LOT less frequently than I did while I was off medications) I still have paranoid thinking/thoughts... And most of my delusions are gone- Or at least, I am better able to recognize what is a delusion and what is not. (EX: My mind still tells me people are spying on me through mirrors/cameras, and my mind still thinks I am a lizard, but I am mostly able to tell myself that those things are not real..or at least that other people tell me that they aren't real. (sorry if this is confusing its difficult to explain.) ) I am mainly glad that I hardly ever hear the voices anymore... Anyway, what all do meds fix for you (if your comfortable sharing)?
