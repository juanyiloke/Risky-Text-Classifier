ÊIntense boredom/dull feeling following psychosisHi everyone. So I had an intense psychotic/delusional episode a few months ago which I've been recovering from slowly, and things are going alright. I'm regaining mental function with some regularity and my self-esteem is slowly improving as well. However, I have this problem where everything seems incredibly boring/two-dimensional. I remember when I used to play the sims as a kid I would think "yeah well they can get on their computers and invite people over and move from this side of the house to the other but they're so confined" and then I would feel momentarily sad/claustrophobic for them. This is how I feel ALL the time now. Every news story I read or anecdote I hear or situation I imagine just appears to me so dull and un-inspiring. It's like the first 10 minutes of the matrix when neo is just doing nothing. I know I'm supposed to be trying to get back to normal and doing things I like and maybe even picking up a hobby, but everything seems so dull and pointless. I know this sounds like depression, and maybe it is in a certain respect but it also feels like I'm missing some vital part of my mind. I used to be interested by so many things and now I'm interested by almost nothing, I find. Does anyone else have this problem?
