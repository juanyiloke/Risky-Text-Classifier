Êprescriptionthey're giving me hassle about getting a prescription again, i changed to e prescriptions and the receptiionists don't know how to handle it, i said it says on your web site you do e prescriptions, they started laughingSaid to the gp it's a bit rediculous you making a fuss over these drugs as if i didn't take them you'd be forcing them on meI seem to have to fight a battle to get my pills, should sell my story to the sun. nhs in crisis paranoid schitzoprenic can't get medsI've just got back from seeing my senile mother in brum, i've got enough on my plate without dealing with drs receptionists who i feel are rude and discriminate knowing if i complain it'll be put down to illness
