ÊTalking out loud to your voices.I was just wondering if anyone else has had conversations with there voices? They would always respond to me and in no way did it seem internal everything felt outside of my head. The last time I really heard any of my voices was on Christmas eve. It was like 2-3 AM and the voice (I think named Sam) called me a asshole because I didn't want to take the full dose of my medication to make him go away as I was already on Consta. I decided to take it and that really was pretty much the last time I head voices.
