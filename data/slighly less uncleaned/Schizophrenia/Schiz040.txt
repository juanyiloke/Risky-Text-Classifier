Schizophrenic symptoms or possible physical conditionby DearJaneDoe » Sun Apr 05, 2015 6:27 amHi,Last year, I hadn't been able to go to sleep because I thought someone was talking to me in my mind. I didn't hear anything or have voices talk back to me. I would just have this feeling that the people next door were watching me and hacking into my phone and laptop. I thought this because my phone at the time would shut off and take screenshots randomly. Also my laptop had issues booting up. Also at the time I was experiencing drilling headaches, a burning sensation at the back of my head, and was feeling off balance the day after that. A couple of days I was hospitalized for having delusions and had a ct scan but everything came back normal. Could this possibly be schizophrenia?Thank you
