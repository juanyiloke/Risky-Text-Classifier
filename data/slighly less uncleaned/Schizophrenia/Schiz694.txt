ÊHallucinations and Voices

I suffer from pschosis related to severe depression. I have experienced hallucinations but mainly heard voices. These voices are sometimes just whispers. At other times, when i have been very anxious and in a dream like state with no sense of reality or sound judgement, the voice commands me to do things and will not stop repeating the instructions. I then find myself doing what I have been commanded to do. Then a while later the dream like state disappears and I realise what I have done - sometimes immoral or illegal BUT totally out of my normal non-psychotic character. I then feel massive guilt and remorse.Ê

Has anyone else heard voices commanding them what to do and then with no control of impulses , carried out the actions with no thought of the consequences ??
