ÊOlanzapine and the munchiesWe all know that olanzapine/zyprexa is among the meds that cause weight gain. There is early work by nobel prize winner Solomon Snyder showing that some of this is due to phosphorylation of ampk in the brain but this new research suggests that it is at least in part that endogenous canabinoids are responsible. This is interesting because cbd a canabinoid has been suggested for use in sz and psychosis. Anyway olanzapine has always been postulated to work better than other APs mch like clozapine and I'm wondering if this might be the extra burst of effectiveness at the cost of additional weight gain. While the weight gain is not funny at all I have to admit the idea that it's similar to drug induced munchies is a little amusing, makes sense to me. I'm not sure if this applies to other APs or not.
