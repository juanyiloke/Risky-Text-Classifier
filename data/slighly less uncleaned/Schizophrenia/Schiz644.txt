ÊThoughts of being JesusYears ago in hospital i was sat on the toilet in the ward, & i had a deep & clear realisation that i was Jesus. i challenged it all & decided that i wasn't.During my first episode for a short while i also had the same experience for an afternoon. i have at various times believed that i am the reincarnation of St Paul, the Creator of the Universe, the Devil & the anti-Christ. There has been a lot of religious themed delusions.Êi was raised with quite a religious upbringing in Christianity.ÊThe past 10 years i have been relatively stable on a medication. i have tried to 'de-program' from religious thinking & instead focus on spirituality & in working through a lot of the delusional thinking & experiences.ÊHard to put a lot of all this into words. For quite a few years i keep getting thoughts/feelings that i'm Jesus - i can challenge it all, entertain & play with it all, & put it all into different perspectives. i don't think it is literally true.Ê
