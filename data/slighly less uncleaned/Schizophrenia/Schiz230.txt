I've been volunteering for six months at this place but recently I've called in ill the last 3 of 4 days. I've been too depressed and some days paranoid/anxious. Then I sleep 12 hours and wake up have my coffee and I feel a 5/10 in mood. But when I'm supposed to wake up my mood is 1/10. What to do. I'm doing big things in my life such as finishing my novella which I've gotten great feed back from the three ppl who've read it... I started a summer online class that's stressing me out though...but I can't drop it because its 500$. Maybe I am stressed out with everything going on though. Idk what to do.
