Êsaid to sister "cameron expects you to look after me"I'm feeling a bit low, i at one point said to my sister cameron expects you to look after me she said he may expect it but it's not going to happen, it started as a joke now it's less funny, i said to her what will you do if i end up on the street she said i'lll say thats a very nice street your onWorrying a bit, just put another 60 30 elecy 30 gas, whatever my ability to cope i'm dependent on the benefit system and thats one i sometimes feel holds coping against youI was also housed in this area when i had no where else to go, knowing no one, there was talk about housing people miles away from anyone they know was a breech of human rights, and the right to life, but whatever, in the currrent climate no ones likely to test that in the european court, i should be grateful theres london familys been rehoused in brun or leeds, god knows how that effects the kidsFeeling down maybe if i take my pills it'll help though hate that
