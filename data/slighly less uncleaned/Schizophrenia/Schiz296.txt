While I was in school some years ago, a group of us were enlisted to join a bunch of different dating websites, as well as common interest forums. We were to follow a set of specific instructions so that we could come up with observations about particular patterns of behavior both in and between the participants. We discovered all kinds of things, not in the least the one I will describe below:We began to call them the "bait & bite" girls. They posted mildly seductive photos of themselves (one hopes) (well, how do you know for sure?) luring men into conversations that in time turned increasingly pithy and abusive. It was as though the woman on the other end was looking for men to not only float her egotistical boat, but to abuse when they became sufficiently attached to her.Virtually every male in the research group ran into at least one. I encountered three, and got my lonely, stimulus-seeking, sex-and-romance-addicted, co-dependent clock handed to me twice.One may have to learn by doing. But I was a lot less bipolar and impulsive by the time I was doing that research, and I could learn.It's a dynamic that pops up again and again on any Internet forum. This one is no exception, it appears.I will suggest a reason (because it is a reason I have seen before a few hundred times): The ego that is damaged needs so badly to assert that it is not.My own psychiatric problems were almost entirely wrapped up in compensatory ego defending until I began to observe to notice to recognize to acknowledge to accept to own to appreciate to understand what my ego was doing and why it was doing it.I surely do not believe that this post will have any effect upon what others do, however. Because (right or wrong) I have learned to expect that most people whose egos were battered into resentful submission will defend their compensations forever.
