 Is there a connection between demon and hearing voices?i read this post from other forum and i want to chare it with member : """" I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and have been hearing voices for the best part of 3 years. These voices are a constant strain on my life, although i have learned to live with them, My first experiences Where very scary and had me feeling like i had lost my mind! i don't consider myself to be mad at all, Im just experiencing something paranormal in my opinion maybe something in a different world. I have been searching as many of you have for the reason why these voices have came about from My psycologist and social worker who have only offered advice from a medical and scientific perspective, They just offer treatment in the form of counciling and medication But i don't consider myself to be crazy or ill!Recently I have been exploring thinking on a spiritual level of which i believe (I may be wrong) there my be a connection. This came about the other day when i was watching a old film 'Ghost' with Patrick Swayze, If you remember at the start of the film Patrick (sam) died in a violent death.... (i later learned after some research that, this is the reason some ghosts are unable to cross over into another realm and become trapped in this one) .. his spirit remained, as did many others, These Ghosts are able to interact with people at the right frequency.. I don't know all the specifics there may be someone that can add to or poke holes in my theory but its just a theory Ur welcome to comment What if there is much more to this film then we first perceived and the same principles apply in real life.""""
