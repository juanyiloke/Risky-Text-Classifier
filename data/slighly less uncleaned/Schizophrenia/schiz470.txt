ÊStressed to the Max!Over the past fortnight, I have been becoming more and more unwell due to stress. In the beginning I could handle it, as it was just because of my studies and home life which were stressing me out.ÊNow I feel totally stressed to the max and I have no idea what to do. My flat looks a shambles, I haven't eaten properly in days and now my schizophrenia is deciding it wants to play a part in making me stressed. I hear constant voices now which aren't that nice and keep telling me to commit suicide. I don't necessarily agree with their reasoning but I've lately thought about methods in which I could kill myself.Even when I am with my best friend (who lives across the street from me), I feel isolated and depressed. She is a voice hearer too (but doesn't have schizophrenia) and understands about the voices, but she thinks I need to find some way to relax and see if the voices calm down a bit.ÊMy psychiatrist wants me in hospital but I am determined not to go. Who would look after my pet rat? He needs me on a daily basis! Besides if I did go, it would interrupt his training. I have many assignments due for college in the next three weeks. I am scared I will fail, but seeing the amount of apathy I have for the actual workload, I probably will fail anyway.ÊI keep on seeing things I have to remind myself aren't real. It is scary, especially when you are tired. I haven't been sleeping that fantastically but you get that I suppose (I am averaging 3-4hrs sleep a night).ÊI am scared, really scared of what is happening to me. I dare not share this with my friend or any doctors or workers involved in my care. I know I am probably going to relapse soon and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. It's like a cyclone... you know it is going to hit, it's just a matter of when and how much damage there will be.Anyway thanks for my rant.Ê
