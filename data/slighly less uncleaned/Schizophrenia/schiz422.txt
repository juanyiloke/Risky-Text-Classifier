Êlabels and namesI find a lot of people debating over the names of mental illness and even over that too. nobody cares what its called, when my doc told me i had schizophrenia the name meant nothing to me the illness did. you can put whip cream on top of it and a cherry but it'll still be schizophrenia. so stop with the changing the names cause changing the names of the illness won't cure you at all. you'll still have it instead put the focus how to actually help these people. when a doc walks into a room and tells a person they have cancer you think that person cares what the name is lol not at all
