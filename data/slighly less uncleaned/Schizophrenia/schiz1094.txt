My thoughts wake me upI have bipolar disorder but am recently rediagnosed from schizophrenia. Since being put on my new medication, sleep has become an issue. I have been pretty good about taking Ativan to get to sleep which seems to work for a few hours.Lately, however, my thoughts have been waking me up. They are not thoughts related to the day's events or anxiety about what I have to do, because this happens on my days off as well. Instead I wake up with a question, usually philosophical in nature that starts a racing thought process until I get up. Does anyone else have a similar issue?
