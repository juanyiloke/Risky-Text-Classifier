My day is a terrible one. My mother in law's mom passed away so everyone is up north. I was told that i can't be there since they worry i might flip out. Their words not mine. I wasn't really close to her but my partner loved her like her own grandmother. I cried for a minute or two but that's about it. I think sometimes the medicine affects my emotional responses.I've also been getting pressured by my parents to move closer to them. My mom wants me to take care of her. I don't know if i can handle that much responsibility. My partner may have temporarily lost her job which my mom thinks is good since there is a hardees just down the high way but i'm not comfortable with my partner riding her bike down the high way.I've been paranoid lately, i walked a mile to the nearest store a few days ago and i thought the dogs were talking to me and the small bugs on the bridge over the river had tiny cameras on them and were following me. I forgot to take my meds that day and the night before.
