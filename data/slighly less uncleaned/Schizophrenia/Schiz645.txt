ÊPsychosis getting worse. Should I wait to see therapist?Hi, my psychosis is getting much more intense and constant. I'm feeling really scared, and I had to wait three weeks to see a therapist, who only said she thinks I need intensive cognitive therapy, and referred me to someome else, who I have to wait even longer to see. I know that I should be grateful that it's not longer, I'm just feeling so frustrated, and I want to help it before it gets even worse. Should I try and wait, or should I go to my GP, and tell them that It's really starting to get worse?Last night I went to see a show with my friend, luckily I told him about my psychosis, and I was seeing horrible things throughout it. Then we had to walk about two miles home, and I was even worse then. The worst was when a car went by, and as it did, it lit up this horrible monsterous thing dressed in white, with blood all down it's front. It was hiding in the bushes, and jumped out at me. I screamed and really got upset,but my friend was so supportive, luckily.__________________
