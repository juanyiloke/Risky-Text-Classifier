Alot of us think that we have powers and things, or make some things happen with our thoughts, you've may have heard us talking about such things. Here is why, because "spirits" can do certain things to your perceptions and sensory equipment. For instance, a spirit can know alot of things about our little world here, for instance, knowing what will happen, and they can speak to us any of the time, put thoughts in our heads and things, so they can make anything like a leaf falling from a tree or something that happens on television seem to be caused by you or coicencide with your thoughts. Some schizophrenics are also told things, it happens to me all of the time, with things that happen, I will be watching a show and just by the peoples facial expressions and what is being said and laughter I can know alot with their help. Sometimes it seems that the people on television are reacting to what Im thinking or doing, but it's just the spirits though, although there is always some truth in how they react. You can actually know alot about people in this way, even people that you've never met. And it's actually quite easy for them to do, Im not sure what they are capable of completely or how they live but it's obviously quite a bit, and they are very very very quick and intelligent, it's as if they don't need to think or figure anything that happens here out. They can make you hallucinate as well, auditory is quite common. So, you should know that humans and our little animal friends aren't the only ones here, just thought that you should know. And we should discover what they can do exactly for future references. P.s, its the strangest thing, while I was writing this, the police stopped by and asked if I had called them or heard someone yelling, they said it was from a schizophrenic guy that was hearing voices or something, pretty strange right?
