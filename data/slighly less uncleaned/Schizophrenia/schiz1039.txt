 Telling parents or psychiatrist about shizophreniaWhen I was little I used to stare at walls or run around talking aloud to myself and playing "make-believe". I've been doing things like that for as long as I can remember. When I was in 6th grade I was diagnosed with ADD. I have stopped talking to myself but I still stare a walls and in my head a million stories are being told about things and people who aren't real and who have no connection to me. I am a senior in high school now, and this is still going on. Recently these stories in my head have been following me into real life. Sometimes I see things in the shadows that have the clarity of a reflection from water, but they're there. Things that jump out at me through windows of doors after I close them. Things that sneak around corners so that I can barely see them. Its hard to describe how they make me feel. I kind of like them, being able to see hints of things other can't and having all these magical, sad, scary but beautiful stories swimming in my head. But I know it's bad. I don't know how to tell people. I feel kind of selfish, like I don't want to sharewhat's in my mind. My parents would brush it off if I told them, and I would probably start crying after the first word came out of my mouth. I don't want to cry. What should I do? Should I talk to a someone? What if I don't want my parents to know? Would a person from school like a teacher or a psychiatrist be required to tell?
