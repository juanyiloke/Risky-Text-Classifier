Thoughts about my diagnosis?I'm just curious about my paranoid schizophrenia. Like if I was diagnosed correctly. Before I was put on a med, little things like putting a cigarette out on the garage floor would keep me awake all night wondering if the garage was going to burn to the ground. Or when I sat on my front porch if there were animals or people watching me across the street in the woods. I would get extremely paranoid over leaving appliances plugged in or on while not in the room. I could go on but I'll stop there for now. So what are y'alls thoughts on it? Was my diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia right?
