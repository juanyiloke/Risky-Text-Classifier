Does this sound like schizophrenia?Some things that have happened to me (some older, some more recent) which seem like they could fit into schizophrenia. I am going to a psychiatrist soon, so I will also get a professional's opinion. I am also interested in which ways your thinking is different from those around you.. as I am not sure what is merely my personality and what is 'pathological' So this is the list;- Friend was talking, his voice gradiently silenced and a song started playing instead while his lips were still moving- I was listening to music from another room and a song I vaguely heard maybe 2 times in my life came on, played through (lyrics, everything) and then ended. I wanted to put on another one, only to notice this one never played, in fact there was silence the whole time.- I hear people calling me by name when they're not- I hear people near me say things when they're silent (not sure)- I saw a small object being thrown and disappear when touching the ground, I followed it with my look and my friends were all staring at me, shocked- I lose vision sometimes- I saw my room warp and my roommate grow larger- My mentality is alien and I've been paranoid since ever- I dropped acid and realized it's how I feel all the time; my thoughts can inflict physical pain/choking/paranoia or a very good trip, I draw same art sober or not
