Alone In The WildernessI will tell you, I feel real alone in most mental “health” chat rooms and forums. There are so many parrots out there, that just repeat what they are told and do no research and take no chances. A lot of very frightened people, so afraid of doing their homework and growing up. So afraid of pain and suffering they will use any means necessary. How they attack me on any level they can! It's not only in so called “mental health” chat rooms that I feel alone, I feel alone when I go to the mainstream psychiatrist, social worker, talk “therapist”. Often I feel like I am standing in front of my judge, jury and executioner. Just another arm of the broken and steadily more an inverted-totalitarian state, that can incarcerate me, drug me into compliance, or refuse me treatment, based upon what I tell them. So called mental “health” chat rooms and forums are no different really, they argue and shut me up, ban me, edit my words, delete my posts, lock posts from comment. Yeah its getting real totalitarian everywhere. Expressing incorrect thoughts, brings out the thought police. They tell you PROVE everything you say, like the scientific method APA citation should be applied to every discussion that is contrary to their view point. Their screaming for proof just proves to me they have not researched and they are essentially in a fall back and comfortable position of following the lemmings off the cliff and taking down with them as many as possible.When everything we do has some sort of corporation or group (other than WE THE PEOPLE) attached to it that makes the rules, when the tyranny of the majority is dictated by the minority – where is the freedom of press or speech? Where is freedom of choice -- is it only between which drug, which corporate product?I am at a cross roads --Fight or Flight? What do you think I will do?
