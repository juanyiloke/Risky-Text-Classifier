One of my old pdocs told me this was unusual. I see these little monsters. Sometimes just one other times hundreds. I can hear them in the walls they skitter like cockroaches. My old pdoc i told right away about them and she said it was unusual for patients my age to see little monsters like i described. I don't know if she believed me or not. I haven't told my current pdoc about them for fear he will lock me up or not believe me. i started seeing them about a year after my illness started at first i thought it was just stress induced since at the time my partner was about to have surgery on her ovaries for cysts.I saw the first one in a coffee cup i was drinking out of so i threw the cup across the room. Then i started seeing them more and more. Should i tell my current psychiatrist or wait until they become a problem?
