There was an oprah on yesterday about childhood schizophrenia. It was weird. They didn't say anything about what happens internally at all. They just showed this little girl saying weird things that nobody understands because they can't see whats happening, nor hear it. I suppose that you'd have to be in our shoes to understand. It was the strangest thing also, they showed this one part of the show, this little girl had made a friend in the hospital, and this other girl was on camera, and she brought up seeing shadows, if you've ever seen shadows you'll know what Im talking about. she said that when "they" "spirit" you, you get migraines upon other things. It was wierd. Has anyone else seen shadows, and do they "spirit" you? Did anyone else see this show?
