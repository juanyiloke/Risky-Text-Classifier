Is it normal or...?by CatSlave » Wed Jun 03, 2015 10:29 pmWhen I study a lot or when I'm very stressed sometimes I start hearing my thoughts. Yes. I know they come from my head but I can't control them. They don't let me concentrate in studying because they stress me and they neither let me sleep because when it's silent and I'm trying to sleep I suddently hear my voice thinking by itself and the noise of it disturbes me and don't let me sleep peacefully. Those thoughts don't say anything scary or coherent. They say things like for example: window, exams, dogs... They usually are related to what I'm thinking about or i've heard during the day. Also I have read that this is a common thing and means that your brain is working but it happens sometimes or rarely. In my case I think that if I'm not stressed it happens to me sometimes but I don't pay attention to it. But now it is almost constant and it annoys me.How do people study without hearing or being annoyed by their thoughts?
