ÊInternal vs external auditory hallucinationsSo I'm kind of confused about something. I've been having "external halllucinations" i.e. hallucinations that sound like they're coming from somewhere like another room or downstairs or right behind me. But lately I've been having voices that sound like they're coming from inside my head. Are those hallucinations too or are they just some weird form of intrusive thought that has a kind of sound component? I'm new to these so I'm wondering what the deal is. Is there such a thing as internal and external hallucinations?Diagnoses: Bipolar I, GAD, ADHD? Schizoaffective? (My pdoc refuses to eval. me for ADHD and I have to get a brain scan to rule things out, and if it comes back clean I'm probably going to be diagnosed Schizoaffective.)
