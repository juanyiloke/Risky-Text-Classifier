VoicesI have been taking medication for 3 months, they are controlling my delusions but the voices are still persistent. i have learnt to live with the voices in that i just ignore them. They always come from the outside of my head, and they are always the same voices. They are usually negative in that I am useless but sometimes they can be positive by encouraging me to do but they turn nasty when I don't. It is a noise I have been living with for 15 years.I don't mention it to my doctor as I am afraid I may get scheduled as I have been on medication for awhile and therefore she may think I am not responding and thus make a case for containment in order to be treated. I probably should because the voices do get in the way of making rational decisions especially when my mood is really affected as it often is
