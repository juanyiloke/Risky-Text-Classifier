You can become symptom free with the help of the doctors and medication. I testify to that, I have done all the anti psychiatry anti medication stuff. The docs and pills can only do so much, it's up to you to help yourself also, they can't live your life for you. The internet can be a useful "guide".You have heard all the stories when people stop taking their meds and they end up in hospital. Your personal shame is being directed towards the doctors and medications. Denial and rejection of treatment/help is a way to cope with the emotional pain.If you want to get your meds reduced by a doctor, you have to help yourself. They can help you to help yourself. A former mental patient is telling you to go to a doctor and use them as a resource tool. Even if you think I am some undercover doctor trying to entice you to a doctors office. If you have the strength to ask for help from a doctor, you have the strength to move ahead in the dangerous world we live in and possibly have your meds reduced. The best way to get off the meds, is to take responsibility for your emotional pain and accept you feel shame about thinking you can't cope.Otherwise the unconscious will decide for you.
