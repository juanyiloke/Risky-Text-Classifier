Doe you have Auditory hallutionations about god and the devil?I have Auditory Hallutionations..they started at the age of 36 at a hotel room, at first it was just about the guy i was sleeping with then it gradually turned into a god and a devil thing talking to me like im special or something plz.. and still with the guy saying he has telepathy with me and can read my mind...it has been so real that i have believed that i have done the worst sin in history - cheaty on my husband who verbal mainly and physical abused me.Before this I was trying to move on with my life and was feeling good but not great, i was getting over a 14 yr marriage.. The first episode was just a voice but then turned into some out body experience of visual hallutionations of bugs and spiders...it has been even sexual where my interupted thoughts turn into electric impulsed that stimulated my privated area to contract...to make me believe this god and the devil said that i cheated, But supposly i was supose to get pregnant..figure that one out hmmm!!!! All day long...Ill keep you post on these thoughts because we are all sinners and i believed i loved jesus and god before this...your not alone!!! specifly who here deals with hearing voices from god or the devil? and how is this affecting ur memory.
