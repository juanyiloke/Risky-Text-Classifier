ÊPsychosis & Visionary StatesHow many people here can identify aspects of psychosis as a visionary state?When i was 17 i had been out one evening, & upon returning home i became very euphoric, & was convinced that everyone was going to heaven. i felt like i was on the verge of discovering the meaning of life. i had been reading a lot of spiritual & obscure books at the time & sat down on the bedroom floor & opened one of the books. There was an exercise i'd been practising about turning conscious awareness within. In an instant i heard a disappearing scream inside of me, which i was immediately convinced was me losing my soul, & i went into a extremely altered state. Very hallucinatory physical vision, & i was in a state or sheer terror.ÊIt was like waking up to the Universe & having a massive 'download' of information - i saw a vision of a Global conspiracy & the end of the World. i was in a highly distressed state. i was living with my mum & brother at the time, & was so panicked that all i could think of was escape & some idea of finding a 'Christian Underground'. i kept running away & the people around me were very worried about the state i was in. After some days of not sleeping & the police being regularly called, i was sectioned & spent 4 months on a locked ward.ÊThat was the beginning of my journey with severe psychosis 25 years ago. Things have never been the same since.Êi can't find definite answers to it all, & i have kind of concluded it's what psychiatry says it is - a severe case of schizophrenia - whatever schizophrenia is meant to be exactly?i went on to go through another 8 major episodes/breakdowns, & years in florid psychosis, & 3 more hospitalisations. A lot of the experiences i had i would describe as visionary.ÊHave maintained the medication for the past 10 years, & it does seem to take the edge off things. i have also found the work of John Weir Perry interesting (among other things) & it has resonated with me -
