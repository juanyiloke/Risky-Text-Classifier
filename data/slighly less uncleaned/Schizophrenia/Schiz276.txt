Hello,,I have posted here many times about my delusions of persecution. I had visited a lot of Doctors and everyone one of them diagnosed me to have Schizophrenia and prescribed me medications.I have however recovered from this illness without any medications. I used Rationality, insight and as the picture of my marriage became clearer I got better. I found out that my Wife was cheating with me from the first week of the marriage and the entire environment caused me intense stress which could have caused these delusions. My delusions of persecution against my parents were caused by this.I am feeling better now.I really feel that we need to give time and not jump into medications immediately. Many times Life stressors causes Delusions and once the stress is gone the delusions too go away automatically.
