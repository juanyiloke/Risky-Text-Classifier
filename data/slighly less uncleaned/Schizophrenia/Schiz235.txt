I have schizophrenia and I am beset with a strange sort of phenomenon- Staring spells that last hours. I have to shade all light from my eyes. Physical exertion causes them, over stimulation of my mind, emotional stress, alcohol, etc. Valium and clonapin are the only drugs that work on them. I take Haldol, although I stopped it as of today and went back to Abilify, but while I was on Haldol, my nurse-practitioner told me she had a patient with schizophrenia who would stare at the ceiling and benadryl or cogentin worked to stop them. I have been injected with a high dose of benadryl in the hospital when I was having one of my "spells" and it did nothing for it, neither does cogentin. I am seeing a neurologist and he doesn't know what it is either. I can't take valium forever as I am gaining a tolerance for it and eventually it won't work. I've had a spell that lasted close to 24 hours and afterwards my eyes were blurry and I had to wear reading glasses to read even large print for about 2-3 weeks, then my eyes returned to normal. Anyone have anything like this?
