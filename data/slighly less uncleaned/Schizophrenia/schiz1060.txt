dystonia tremors?I have been afflicted from dystonia before (uncontrollable movement or paralysis of a muscle) because of my meds (i'm on seroquel and clozaril all the time, and thorazine on an as needed basis.) however, i haven't had problems for awhile, and my dystonia always manifested itself as paralysis of the tongue (it can manifest in many different ways.) however, last night was really bad. my back was seizing and spasming every few seconds. it wasn't a panic attack and it wasn't a seizure. my mind was fine, and after it stopped being scary it was simply annoying. i was in no pain. i have been having some trouble so i had taken a high dose of thorazine a few days prior, but i would have thought the results would be immediate if it was from the thorazine (thorazine has been known to be bad for dystonia.) i must add too that i have been on prescription painkillers for the past year because of a nasty chronic illness. i have been trying to take less and have been wondering if this is affecting me (either the taking less or the commutation of build up of the meds.my mom talked to my doctor and she seemed stumped, saying that having spasms over and over isn't like typical dystonia. has anyone had anything like this? it doesn't seem like tardive dyskenesia but i'm still a big scared.
