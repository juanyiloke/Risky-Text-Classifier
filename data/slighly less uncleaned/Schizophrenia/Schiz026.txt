Was Diagnosed Today, Please Help :(by Choong Jing » Thu Dec 12, 2013 12:47 amThree days ago I went to a psychologist because I was scared that I might be in the early stages of Schizophrenia. The psychologist gave me this MMPI-2 test, and I took it. The few questions there that were obviously meant for psychotics (like "Do you think people can read your thoughts) I answered as false, so I went home feeling safe. Two months prior I had massive anxiety of becoming psychotic and I thought I am seeing things in my peripheral vision etc, and that test let me calm down.But today when I went back to the psychologist she says I am diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. I was shocked, the psychologist kept saying that if I take my medication and keep on with the recovery plan I will be just like normal people. But I don't believe her, the future just seem so hopeless for me and I am only 19 :'(. What can I do? The SZ result from the test is Skyhigh along with PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety. Along with that I am stuck with a father that abused me as a kid and a schizophrenic mom. Online say that recovery highly depend on the support of family and I know I will get none of it. I told my dad that I am going to become just like my mom and he started getting angry at me. I am so sad, I do not know what to do. Do I have any hope?? Does medication guarantee that I will have a normal life?? I haven't had my first psychotic episode yet but if I take medication does that mean I will be functioning completely normal? This is all just so crazy right now. Please give me advice on what I should do.... My life depends on it. I swear I am about to kill myself
