I have a friend, she's a bit older than me. She really had a lot of ???? in her life, her husband has cheated on her, her mother recently died from the severe brain strokes after which she was diagnosed with the neurobiologically induced psychosis. .. She took care of her mother as she was unable to funcionate by herself.Still..she's very positive, very joyful person. Doesn't see a psychiatrist, doesn't take antidepressants. She says that her gym classes and caring for the kid heals the anxiety and negative thoughts.Always wondered whats the deal with that. How some people can handle the stressful events just with a "natural" self help.?ÊPositive thoughts, faith, exercise and all that ????.
