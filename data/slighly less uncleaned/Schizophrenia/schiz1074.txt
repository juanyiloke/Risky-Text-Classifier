schizophrenia--when will i recover???I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, two years ago. My dad is an ENT specialist. Since he is a doctor, he immediately found that something is wrong with me psychologically, and he immediately took me to a psychatrist. The psychatrist advised me to take medicines. Amisulphride tablets were prescribed for me. i took the medicine for almost 1.5 years. With regular visits to the doctor, i became normal again. The doctor also kept on tapering my dose gradually as my conditions improved. Since the doctor is going abroad, i was referred to another one, who prescribed me another set of tablets.(which he said was the most recent one).My problem now is that, the doctor and my parents are constantly discouraging me, saying that since i am taking medication now,i am different from others and i cant achieve things in life like other people. Actually, i am planning to do higher studies abroad. They are saying that schizophrenia, is a life long psychotic disorder, from which i cant recover throughout my life and has to take tablets for the rest of my life.....Many of my friends have gone abroad for studies,, but they wont let me go, because i am in medication....I have cried many nights thinking about my future and how this dreadful disease has shattered all my dreams.All i want to know is that, when will i be able to survive without the medication like a normal human?????please reply....
