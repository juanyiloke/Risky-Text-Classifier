I'm moving at the end of the month. At least I learned how low and rotten some people are and how they don't have any pride. And then they have the absolute f-ing nerve to set themselves up like they are somehow superior. Sorry, I'm in a bad place in my mind right now. If I scared any of these losers that I live with than that makes me happy.ÊOK, I'll be fine now. I got paid today, had a good day at work, looking forward to the weekend. My goal is to get out and either hit an AA meeting or go across the street for coffee. And I've been walking a lot lately. I take laps around my complex.ÊOK, I calmed down. My step-dad is probably right. They think what they're doing to me is perfectly alright. They don't know it's wrong. Please don't ask me what they did to me.You can't put daily insanity into words.
