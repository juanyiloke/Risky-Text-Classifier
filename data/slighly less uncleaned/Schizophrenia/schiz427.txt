DrugsEssentially I know enough about the drugs, especially for psychosis (the anti-psychotic variety) that to tell people to get on them is unconscionable to me. At the same time I know of treatments, a variety of them, that tend to have better results or comparable results with out drugs. If I even mention the dangers of the drugs in a forum or chat room starts a conflict with the Moderators or Operators of such sites which usually leads to a ban. Anyone that can read the inserts that come with these drugs, should know how dangerous they are. But there is more to it than that Ð its what they don't reveal that is worse. Brain and nervous system damage, shorter life expectancy, addiction, withdrawal, organ failure, severe illnesses such as diabetes, and instant death in some cases. To not discuss this is essentially standing around while people are murdered and maimed.Ê
