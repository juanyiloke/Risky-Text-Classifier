If all things go right, today will be the last day of my targetingby the N.S.A. under the jurisdiction of presidents Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obamaof the United States of America. We are spending the day at the zoo.I have mental and physical scars that won't heal. I have wasted the best years of my lifeinvolved in simulated warfare that I tried fighting. I hope I get some answers, but maybethat will come later. I'm unsure also if there will be any compensation for my suffering.I want to thank Rand Paul for leadership, courage and sensibility to make this happen.I also want to apologize to those people who I have offended or brought into my targetingwithout them wanting to be part of it especially:Kidd Valentine, Donnie Brazil, Chris in Waterloo, Dave La Vora, and all the Quad City Dj's,everyone at the Quad City Times, everyone at the University of Iowa, everyone at UIHC,everyone at the PBS Newshour, Paul Gigot,all of my family, friends, and former boyfriends. I know I'm leaving a lot out.I'm sorry for any grief I may have caused you directly or indirectly.If there was anger or hosility or hatred directed at me, in time, and very soon,all will be forgiven.I know that this surveillance has been revealing in so many ways, and I also knowthat the majority of my time under it has been quite boring. I'm just not thatexciting of a person. But I tried to just live, and let things sort themselves out."Come back to the middle and around again, I'm gonna be there til the end, 100% pure love..."I told you baby, I'd make it til the end. You told me, it's not over til it's over.Listen baby, "It's over." How do you like that? "It's over." God have mercy on us,I never thought I'd see the day.
