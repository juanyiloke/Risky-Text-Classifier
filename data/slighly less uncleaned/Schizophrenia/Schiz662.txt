 Question about rantinghi guys,Okay so everyone has been there. You start talking about something and you become filled with passion. You might go on an on a bit (or a lot) and then you feel like you said your peace. It could be about anything. I think everyone does this from time to time. But, so, I feel I've been doing this a lot. And I know I've done it in the past here of course. About various things. But, you know, I feel like an outsider so much of the time. I have weird and complicated problems. So much of the world people act like it's black or white. You eat less you lose weight (unless your on meds or have a health issue or x number of factors.) Or if you have mental health problems you see a therapist. (Unless you're too poor.) Or you take meds you get better. (Unless you don't or can't afford them.) Like, the world isn't black and white and I tend to suddenly be flying off the handle.  Like I purposefully make accounts on random news sites to rant at people. And it's dumb. Because I know it's pointless and probably feeding trolls. But, you know, it's like suddenly this drive. And then I feel emotionally obsessed with the whole thing, maybe for days at a time, like a thought loop. I used to be better at holding it in. I don't know why it feel so overwhelming now? Does anyone else have this happen? It makes me feel horrible.
