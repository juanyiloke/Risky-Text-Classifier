ÊStrange thoughtsI just wanted to share a few experiences. I was an avid drug user I took a cocktail of drugs for several years before being sectioned and stopping drugs eventually altogether. The thing is it was when I decided to think more about the future without drugs that I was sectioned. I got into architecture. And I think it was this obsession that triggered off my psychotic episode - ok so I was mixing acid with ecstasy, but that was nothing new. Thinking about the wider world seemed to trigger me off.Now I'm completely obsessed with architecture I love buildings and when I lived near London used to walk around it for hours. I read about architecture all the time. one of my favourite buildings is canterbury cathedral and I used to spend hours in there when I lived there. I love the rich diversity of styles, fabrics and different periods that juxtapose each other in London. My favourite places are cities I love Venice and New York. When I go on holiday I visit cities like Rome instead of going to the beach and I do so in the spring and autumn.ÊI love all styles of architecture and can't decide which is my favourite old or new I think I prefer old though - New York was amazing with all its sky scrapers. I'll never forget.The thing is I live in a rural area now and don't get into cities much apart from when I go on holiday
