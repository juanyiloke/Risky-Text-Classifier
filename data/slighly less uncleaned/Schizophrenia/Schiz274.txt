The last one that was a jerk promised that he would give me a kitten 2 weeks ago, he said he would have called until yesterday, but he didn't, so I called the animal shelter for a second time, I got exposed to so many people (I also asked for a kitten on some forums) and finally he called today and my mother told him that we will take the kitten. I am both angry at my parents, but I also don't want to have a kitten from that jerk, I am also exposed to the shelter, I am not really a person that doesn't keep their word, I am an honest person, I am not like others, I am so angry right now, he used up my patience. Bad people should die.
