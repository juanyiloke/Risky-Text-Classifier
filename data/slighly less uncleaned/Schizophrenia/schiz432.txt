ParrotingWhat I find most striking, is how effective the psychiatric \ pharmaceutical propaganda is. How you can take a person that is opposed to drugs (like I was), give him a disorder (socially and culturally induced like mine) so he suffers, send him to psychiatrist, make him dependent on drugs, and for the next 8 years he becomes a parrot for drug companies and psychiatry in mental health forums and chat rooms (LIKE I WAS). Thats really effective, creating an unpaid sales force thats dependent on your product. Genius. Not talking about this in a chat room or forum is like watching Tom Cruise peddle his Scientology crap and not laughing it up with your friends.Ê
