i stopped my medication 12 weeks ago (cold turkey) due to having a physical illness which is still ongoing now, my cpn has said that hes seen me go downhill since coming off the medication....although i feel fine and dont feel ill...i am struggling with the voices at the moment but told the cpn its a 'blip' it will blow over as i am not ill....but because i stopped the medication my symptoms have come back and the voices are telling me that the medication, food and drink are poison.....i have lost 2 stone since 12 weeks agohes seeing me on monday for a possible step up care or hospital...he said that it will be out of his hands if i am to have a mental health assessment which is what i am worried about.....when he saw me last wednesday i promised him i would take 100mg of quetiapine (i used to be on 500mg) to start me off but i only took it on wednesday night and i was out of it...had bad voices telling me to do harmful things so i didnt take anymore in which i left a message on cpns answer phone at 8am yesterday morning and he rang me at 8.50am to ask me if i wanted step up care over the weekend and i refused....he said that it has gone on long enough now 12 weeks and that i havent improved mentally just deteriorating each day and going into a possible relapse but i dont feel i am .....i dont know how else to convince him and the psychiatrist that i am fine.
