Those are the words used by Dr Abram Hoffer, an orthomolecular pioneer, who has since passed away at the age of 90. Personally, I am 72 years old and was first diagnosed to have schizophernia at the age of 28. I have been stable for many years and I am maintained on 2.5mg of Olanzapine daily. My good fortune was to have married my wife of 44 years who was a former RN who trained in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Canada where Dr Hoffer had a practice. My wife is a proponent of orthomolecular medicine (mega vitamins) and keeps me on track with a daily regime to this day. The benefit of mega vitamins IMO is to allow me to get by on a minimal amount of medication. Too many SZs have found the vitamin regime so beneficial that they have UNFORTUNATELY tried to discontinue their meds. I know because it happened to me in the mid 80s. Prior to my first diagnosis I was a military pilot on jet aircraft with 2700 hours logged. Subsequently, I was never able to get a licence to fly because of my medical status. I was lucky that the microcomputer revolution came along which became my niche. So in the context of Dr Hoffers definition of a "cured schizophrenic" where do I stand. In the 40 some years since my first diagnosis I have paid out over $890,000.00 in income tax on earned income. I feel the need to tell my story to help the many young persons affected by this condition see some light at the end of their personal tunnel.
