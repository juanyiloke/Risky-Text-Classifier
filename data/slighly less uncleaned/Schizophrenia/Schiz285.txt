I've noticed what I take to be a symptom of sz recently that I haven't read much about yet. It concerns a loss of trust in the language I use, particularly in writing. It is not that I do not trust the language to convey the meaning I intend to convey. It rather consists of concerns about grammar and spelling that I did not notice before until recently. So it would be a loss of trust in my ability to correctly employ language.Typically, most people will start to get doubts about the spelling of a word when they stare at it for long enough - it will start to look as if something is not quite right. I recently just happen to stare more at the language I am employing. Now I know that if I wouldn't stop to think about it, things will very likely turn out just fine, as I knowthat I am quite competent in the two languages I use. But it seems that I am more inclined to do stop and think about it, and then doubts seem to arise and things will just not feel quite right. It doesn't prevent me from writing, so it is not causing any real problems, but it is an unusual phenomenon that I seem to experience more lately.Anyone familiar with such a thing and/or knows any research on it?
