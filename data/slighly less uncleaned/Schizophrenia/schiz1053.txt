This world is my dreamHi,So basically I am really bad at reading so I will just write a short post!I hear voices all the time and see the other people from the other world, they do bad things to me and messed up things and scary things too. Hardly anyone knows because they punish me when i tell anyone cos they dont want people to know. I believe that this world with you guys in is a dream world and that the voices i hear are from the real other world.I saw a psyciatrist even though i hated seeing him and didnt want to. My only friend made me go. My family doesnt know because when i tried to tell them then they hated it and started to reject me. Anyway this psyciatrist talked to me a few hours and then told me to go away and never come back. He wrote a report saying I have psycotic-like experiences and emotionally imature and need help but he did not give me any or suggest any.Does anyone know what this means or how I can get more support.I try to wake up sometimes, i think if i die then i would wake up but i am scared. Is anyone else here from the same world as me?Stacey x
