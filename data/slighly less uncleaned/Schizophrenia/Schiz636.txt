ÊHospitlizations/no pdocI know this is a touchy subject, but I was wondering if anyone here can actually look back and say they had a positive experience. The only, half-way, positive experience I had was my first hospitalization. Oddly, I was involuntary at the time and in an extra secure ward. Also, I'm not sure if that was just due to the fact that I was literally starving. (They had food, okay.) I'm kind of scared; because, the last time I was in the hospital they threatened to put me in a residential facility on a permanent basis. I've recently quit taking meds. I'm doing okay, but even if I wanted to go back on them, I have no pdoc. (She left for a different job.) At this point, I can't find any pdoc in a 2 hour radius who will take me. I'm not so much scared of the auditory hallucinations putting me in the hospital, but when I used to try to fake "normal," the catatonia gave it away. The catatonia and visual hallucinations are what I'm scared of, and it's just a matter of time, really.
