When they wonder how difficult it is to be mentally ill, imagine this car chase with reality,and reality is gaining all the time, and reality has guns, and reality has every intention offooling you with thinking you are getting away, when really you are going right off a cliff.I knew last night in bed when I got vibrating tailbone that the targeting had not ended,and when I got up today and checked the phone, it was brimming with static on the dial tone,so certainly I've been duped yet again by the government and by the maker.When this moment was certainly to come, I wanted to get really angry and tell them all whatI thought of them, just where they can go, even deeper into hell than me, even farther intoinsanity, but my heart caught in the snare of this feels so defeated by my own deceit.I'm afraid I have led you all astray, there is no God. There is only this king of mental illnessthat traps and fools and relishes in endless pain. I looked so often to the sky, wrote the book,and waited these 5 years now, but nothing could be answered because there is no one.
