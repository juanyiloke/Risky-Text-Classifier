ÊSchizophrenia SongI'm 31 years old now and since the time i was 9 i've had obsessive thoughts that i could never turn off. They were always saying i was a bad person and i would go over my life again and again trying to find proof that this was true. I couldn't turn it off and it ruined relationships and so much more.ÊOne of my closest friends is schizophrenic. When we met we hit it off instantly. What we struggled with was completely different and yet we could relate so well.We were both always into music, hip hop specifically and have been making music for almost 14 years.
