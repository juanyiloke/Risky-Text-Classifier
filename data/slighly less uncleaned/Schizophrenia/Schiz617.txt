Êhelp?isn't schizophrenia related to believing electronics are watching u?Êa while ago, i was showering and i thought my leg was absorbing water. i got very scared. i also thought i could pull my forehead down over my face.the stuff disappeared and my therapist called it a "psychotic break."Êthe past few weeks I've been feeling terrible. yesterday i saw the ground moving in front of my boyfriend's car. it was only one section; nowhere else was moving. i also saw pictures of my family on FB & texted my siblings they are brainwashed and my mom did it.Êi was severely abused growing up.i feel scared. my therapist recommended i go to the hospital, but why? I'm not a threat or feeling suicidal. just very depressed and scared. maybe i have dementia, but I'm only 34.Êi don't want a schizophrenic diagnosis.Êam i worrying too much or does this sound schizophrenic?Êthanks
