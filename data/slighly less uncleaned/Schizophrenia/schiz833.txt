I think my paranoid and somewhat schitzophrenic thoughts have developed from my use of marijuana, I have a really bad trip and it sort of altered my reality. I thought for a night and a day that people could see and hear everything I was thinking at any given moment, everything seemed to make sense. Although I knew better, it continued to mess w/ me, at work and w/ my coworkers, everything just seemed to be correlating to my thoughts and actions, and not my actions alone. After seeing a psichiatrist i'm now on rhisperdol and it's been about aweek, and although my anxieties are slowly going away after exposure, i'm wondering if it's too early to say that the medication isn't working? Anyone in the same position? After having smoked in a similar situation and if I will be cured or not?
