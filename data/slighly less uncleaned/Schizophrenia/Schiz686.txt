ÊFound someone in me today. I couldn't get out lost hoursI'm still a little shaky from this happening. Today someone took over me around my kids she kept rhyming everything and weird rhyming at that. I was trying to get out she would scream out loud crawl back in or I'll kick you deep down in. A couple times I got out a get out and stop it what do you want. She would say Tickety tock I watched you let the last tick tock open the lock. She's mean to me.She Laughed at her stupid cluckety cluck the duck gets plucked plucked plucked now he's never going to cluckety cluck cluck. She was uncontrollably laughing at this like she had lost her mind. Finally I was just in the bathroom staring at the mirror and my dog had been with me but gone found her in bed. Will she come back how can I kick her out. Please someone tell me. I lost more then two hours.
