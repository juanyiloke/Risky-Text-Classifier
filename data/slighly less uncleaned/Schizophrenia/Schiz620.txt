ÊAfraid of being locked up in a psychiatric hospitalHi,I am 18 years old, and I hear voices since many years. I don't have family or friends, so I have to deal with life by my own.I am really done with life, It is too hard, I can't concentrated at college, I don't feel to do anything. Everything is boring... I don't know.I have nothing...I don't know.Lately I have been thinking on seeing a psychiatrist. I was medicated until I was 16, then I stopped because they didn't work and caused me a ton of disgusting side-effects.The matter is I am afraid the doctor forces me to take medication (if they think you can't decide by your own because of your illness, you can be forced) or he locks me in a psychiatric hospital.I know they treat my things only with medication, I know they will see my things as a problem, but I don't want them to go away. I just want to achieve some peace and I need help to do so. But NO medication.I don't know what to do.I need help, but I don't want to be medicated or locked.
