ÊI have picture proof that they're trying to poison my tap water.Every time I get water out of the sink, I have to rinse out my cup at least 4 times before it feels safe enough to drink. Since it's 5:30am, I decided to just rinse it out once and I had a feeling that I should have contiuned but I didn't. I stopped at one. I went to my room and noticed that my water was foggy. Look at the pictures in the attachment. I took the after picture not even 10 seconds after the before picture. I have proof and everyone still wants to just tell me I'm crazy.
