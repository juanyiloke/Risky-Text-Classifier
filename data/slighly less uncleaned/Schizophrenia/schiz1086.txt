Is this a Hallucination?Hi, Im not sure if I am on the right board or not, but I have recently been diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety. I have had this fear that I am going to start seeing and hearing things. Lately I've been worried I have seen things. Then all of a sudden last night i watched a show where someone was talking about Jesus and then in the corner of my eye i saw something moving and imagined Jesus walking past. It was only brief and when I looked back it was gone and I knew it wasn't actually Jesus (obviously) but how do i know if this was a hallucination or my imagination? Also the other day i was looking into the fire and I looked away and saw a bright white square could this also be a hallucination or was that just the light from the fire?
