ÊI don't know my diagnoseHi, I am 27 years old, male. A year ago I had some sort of delusion (that I was followed by police), doctor prescribed me haloperidol (1/4 of 5 mg), after three days that I took medication delusion went off, but after a few months I developed horrible apathy/depression, It has gone more than year and I am still on medication ...I am taking now amisulpride 100 mg, and aripriprazole 5 mg. I am gaining weight and I am very concerned as I don't know what is my diagnose, I did visit doctors in Israel and Georgia but they could not tell me what was my pshycos exactly, somehow I suspect that I have schizophrenia but I don't know, any suggestions?
