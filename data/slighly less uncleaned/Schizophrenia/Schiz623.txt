Êlatuda vs loxapinei bet this will get moved to the med section but no one replies there. i was wondering who here, with schizophrenia has been on both latuda and loxapine. I would like to know the differences. I'm currently on the max dose of latuda and if my symptoms dont get better by june 4th my psych will probably switch me to loxapine, she said. which one is stronger?i've been on a host of antipsychotics with no help. latuda is the first thing to even midly help me but it still isn't enough sometimes. She also mentioned some other typical antipsychotic that began with a P but im not sure what it was.
