ÊDo I have schizophrenia?Hi. I'm new here. I have a big concern regarding my mental health. I won't explain it all, since I think it's quite personal. First of all, I'm young. I'm worried because ever since I was a little girl I've experienced some things that are not normal. I've seen things and hear strange things. I hear voices telling me awful things sometimes. There's one inside my head. A bad one. But, sometimes it makes me feel like I'm some kind of special thing. It's strange. Special in a bad way. I tend to get paranoid quite a lot about different things, like for example demons watching me and wanting to hurt me. I have the same fears with some men. The ones I "tell" myself are bad without knowing them. I have the worst nightmares from time to time which increases the fear. One time I got so scared, my chest started to hurt badly. I have heard noises too. Like crystal being shake, doors opening even though they are close and scratching if you can call it that.ÊI have various experiences (horrible ones), which I don't want to talk about, but here is some things. I hope someone can help me understand if maybe I do have something. Thank you for your time.
