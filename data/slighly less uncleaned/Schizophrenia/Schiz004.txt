Constant/Unending Deja Vu, Voices,by Vivid_Crossroads » Tue Jun 09, 2015 1:09 amI feel like a storybook character who overheard the rest of their story in several short conversations between random friends/strangers and another person. Or I feel like these people were narrating my biography of my whole life as the events and dialogue I overheard plays out exactly the same later in my life. Also I have constant/unending deja vu from a series of dreams I've had, so I feel like i'm on a repeating dream/timeline or trapped in an artificial reality loop. Is this common? Is there a cure? This is very real to me, but I know how impossible it sounds... Also I hear voices as whispers that say random things and then later in life like a month or so i'll come into contact with those things mentioned or think the same thought that they quoted. Sometime people will say something out of the blue like "you're doing this aren't you? and this happened didn't it?" and then later in life I find myself doing that thing and that thing happened... What's creepy is that I have a very good memory, can remember my first word so I KNOW that what I witnessed happened or they were saying completely different things and I imagined it all. I have this feeling there's something or someone behind all of it, like i'm a somniator in a mental hospital that someone is keeping as a puppet and doing all of this to. What are your thoughts? Anyone else experience something like this?
