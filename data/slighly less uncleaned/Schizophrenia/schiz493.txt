ÊHow long before meds take effect?Hi there,I have recently become unwell and i am hearing increased voices and was seeing things too. I had urges to do bad things but managed to resist it, it was assessed by the home treatment team and they took me on but in the end I ended up in hospital for 7 days on the psychiatric ward. I am now released back to Home Treatment Team and I am currently taking Abilify 25mg when I used to be on 15mg and also they've added Citolapram 20mg to try lift my mood.ÊI'm glad to be back at home and HTT are seeing me twice a day, I was just wondering how long before I start to feel a difference with the new and increased meds in other peoples personal experiences?I feel low today and I'm alone at home for most of the day so I am looking forward to the HTT visiting. Also, I was discarged back to my GP before and I told them this would happen yet they never listened and now a few weeks of being discharged I'm back in hospital or was.ÊPlease could anyone give me any advice or information on my next steps as I am wanting a care co-ordinator back to help me keep on top of things. I do realise cut backs are in place with this government but I'm desperate.Many thanks in advance.
