ÊWould having had psychosis in the past, and still taking an antipsychotic prevent me from getting a London Private Hire Driver License?Hi,I am interested in getting a London Private Hire Driver License, so I would be able to do Uber driving.I had psychosis at the end of 2009 going through to start of 2010. I was given a diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified. I am still taking at the moment 300 mg/day of modified release Quetiapine to prevent relapse.Does anybody have any experience of applying for a Private Hire licence? Does a prior history of mental health effectively bar you? Or if it is now controlled are they willing to licence you?Please don't say ask them - because they just say it is assessed on a case by case basis, but the application is expensive.Many thanks for any help.
