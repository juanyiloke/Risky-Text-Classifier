ÊHelp or advice pleaseHi allI'm not sure where to begin with this. I'll try to keep it as short and to the point as I can.I have a close relative in his mid 30's. We only see him maybe twice a year, as we live quite a distance away.ÊOver the years we have seen his behaviour become dramatically more erratic:ÊHe believes people (his family) are plotting against him, he thinks a chip has been implanted in his brain (by his family) to control his thoughts, talks to people that don't exist, bursts out laughing (when he's alone), randomly shouts out nonsense, writes messages on walls in the house, keeps strange hours, the list goes on....ÊWe have seen his marriage fall apart and his young children are afraid of him. He now lives with his mother, who understandably refuses to see the severity of the situation. She either doesn't know what to do or is in denial and buries her head in the sand.ÊWe were staying with them for a few days recently, until he unexpectedly burst into an aggressive rage: He began screaming out profanities, arguing with himself, acted threatening towards us - saying he is going to get a gun and kill us all. We have heard he has 'aggressive episodes', but this episode really shocked and scared us.ÊWe no longer stay with them in the house, but are terrified for his kids and his mother.I have so many questions:Is this schizophrenia?Obviously, he will not seek help (he thinks we are plotting against him). Also, I don't think he believes he has a problem. What can we do? Who can we speak to?Is he likely to harm someone? Or himself?I understand that ideally to answer these question more information is required.ÊI am really worried and feel completely helpless.ÊAny help, advice or information would be greatly appreciated.Many thanks
