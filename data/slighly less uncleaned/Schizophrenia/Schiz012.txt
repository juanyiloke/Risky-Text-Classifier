At first, it may sound like a stupid question, but...by ZonedOut » Sat May 23, 2015 8:12 pm...do/did you somehow 'like' your psychotic episode(s) and/or do you sometimes secretly long for another one?I'm asking this because a while ago, during a group therapy session, someone said he actually 'liked' his last psychotic episode in some sense. He does so, as he said, because he now experiences life as being very dull, and during his psychotic episode, at least something was happening, and he felt great. He misses that presence of feeling he had during his psychotic episode. Some group members agreed. Others didn't. But it makes sense to me.His remark made me think of my own situation, and made me think of what I would prefer. I'm familiar with the dullness of experience he describes. However, I've never been psychotic. All I've experienced is some paranoid thinking, with reality testing still intact. I guess it depends on what kind of psychosis someone is familiar with, don't you think? I cannot imagine a paranoid psychosis being pleasant, judging from my own, limited, experience with paranoid thinking. But what about a manic psychosis?
