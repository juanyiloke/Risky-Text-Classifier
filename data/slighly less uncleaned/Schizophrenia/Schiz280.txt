Did you ever whittle wood with a knife as a kid? That was a big pastime for me and my friends when we were kids. We took a chunk of wood and carved little boats or canoes out of it and sailed them in puddles or in the gutter after a rain. I think it's a lost art, my nephews never did it. We carved bows and arrows out of tree branches and a string to shoot each other or to shoot stray cats or dogs. Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn would have been proud of us.
