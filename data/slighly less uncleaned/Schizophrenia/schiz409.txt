Ê15 yra ago perceived wisdom was that schitzoprenics shouldn't workOne psychiatrist said 15yrs ago perceived wisdom was that schitzoprenics shouldn't work, that was what i was up against when i came to london 30yrs ago with a schitzoprenia label to seek my fortuneGot a degree not bad before any disability discrimination act then couldn't get a jobMade up a work history got a job interview, they sent me a form asking my permission for my gp to give medical data, if i hadn't signed it they'd have known something was upI asked the gp not to mention schitzoprenia he said there were medical benefits to mentioning it and refused, anyway they realised at the interview i'd made up the work historyGot a job in social services was asked for 2nd medical, told my co worker who was training me i was schitzoprenic she went off sick, when she did turn up she was on valium, she applied for redeployment on stress grounds, got it and left me doing 2 peoples job without trainingAfter a year they brought in someone to help me, they suggested i apply for redeployment on stress grounds, i saw the council dr then the boss called me in said he'd said i was unfit for work and to go home and sent in sick notesI fought that with the help of the union turned out the dr had said i was unfit for my present job but fit for another job with the council, they were all nimbysI had so much hope thought i could get better theres that american schitzoporenia org that says the worst thing stopping recovery is the labelParadoxically i'm now having to prove illness to the dwp, i doubt after all i've been through i can workMy health hasn't been helped by been left in poverty and bad housing, i mentioned that psychiatrist who at one point said i could lead a normal life, allowing my family to cut the ties and allowing social services to leave me harrassed by problem kids before problem kids or disability hate crime, assuming at the time i could have argued disability
