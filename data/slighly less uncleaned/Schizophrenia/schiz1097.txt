Whats wrong with me?Since I was little I would have Daydreams or images of killing my friends and family.I would never do it but I cant stop the thoughts.I have gone as far to thinking of how I would do it and deal with the after affects.ÊRecently I have thought of killing everyone in my house while they were sleeping by stabbing them.I talked to my mom and she said a lot of out family has those problems and schizophrenia runs in our family.The only experience I have had with it is sometimes while in trying to sleep I would hear people I know calling my name in my head once or twice. No it was not a dream or a hallucination. The voice came from my head!What is this?
