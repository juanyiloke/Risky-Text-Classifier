When I was 12 I experience a form of tactile hallucination. I truly thought that my eyes would fall out and I consinally touch and rub my eyes to make sure they didn't. It felt so really that I told my mom but she told me it was all in my head that nothing was happening. It got so bad that I got parinoid. It happened for a year and stopped. The other experience happened in March of the next year and it happened while I was eating dinner with my family when I couldn't swallow. I really thought I couldn't swallow and I ended up losing weight and was hopialized. But a year later I was fine again like nothing happened. And sometimes when I'm laying down in bed my bed shakes but when I look noting is there. Tell me what you think about this! I'll like to know your guys experience too.
