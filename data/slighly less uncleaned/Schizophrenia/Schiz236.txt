It just occured to me tonight that no matter how badly I may want to smoke weed that I should just forget about it. The only connect I have right now is my nephew in another town and every time I get it at all I pay through the nose for just a joint. I almost did it today and I cancelled it before it got here and now I know that I should just forget about it. No more pining, no more desperation cleaning out my pipe for the umpteenth time just for a hit. No more poverty from buying it !! I know many on here don't like weed and I have been silent about it but no more. I am shouting from the rooftops. I am done with weed. for good.
