Schizophrenia, or reality.Explanation: the voices started in the head like they're entities searching for me on the streets, everywhere. Then I realized it was nonsence, and then they transformed to real voices like a man transforms to a werewolf. Not the persons walking on the street for me like before and I could see them. Then came the dead, yes and I thought for a long time I m media. Cause they banged on the upper floor and I couldn't do much. I also believe I can control them with vizualizations so as they can. Some med just put me asleep or take down my agression from me, but they dont interact with voices, excatly. So, am I media, six sense activated, or just having those shizophrenic voices in the head for few years, and am I chronnicaly attached to that disease, I wonder? How did someone broke them, cause I m battling with them with my thoughts and still have no result on winning them. I talk with them everytime I hear them and so the talk-talk begins. I think talking to them is good, otherwise they would swallow me like a candy bar.
