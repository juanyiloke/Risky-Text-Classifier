Ê4 R's of MindfulnessSo I've been watching practicing mindfulness an introduction to meditation by Mark Muesse. He came up with 4 R's that remind me a lot of cbt/dbt.The idea is you have thoughts that are negative or otherwise bad and get rid of them using the 4 R's.ÊThey are as follows...replacement, reflection, redirection and reconstruction.Replacing is just swapping out a negative thought for a positive. So let's say someone cuts you off in traffic instead of flipping them off you're supposed to replace it with something friendly or compassionate so maybe I'm sure they're running late perhaps there is an emergency or something else forgiving.Reflection...the idea is you think about your thoughts themselves this is meta cognition. Do you want to be the kind of person who thinks the kind of thoughts that you are having or would you rather be different/better.Redirection is just distraction this is the typical cbt/dbt technique where you do other things that you like better..in meditation you simply refocus on the breath.Reconstruction is a lot like what we did in cbt for delusions.....so in reflection you think about consequences of the thought but in reconstruction you think of what lead to the thought and you can challenge those assumptions.Anyway hope this helps someone....mindfulness has been shown to help with psychosis specifically.
