Êschizophrenia great newsI've long believed that schizophrenia could have a very simple cause. My pet subject interest is evolutionary biology and I always felt that , the modal of a simple process causing complexity , fit schizophrenia as a disease perfectly.There is some good news , the possibility of schizophrenia being linked to one gene is growing. Why is this good news? It means that the chances of an effective , highly targeted treatment improves immeasurably based on this research , it also improves the chances of preventing and stopping the disease.
