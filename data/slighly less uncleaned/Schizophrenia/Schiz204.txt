I'm Diagnosed as a Paranoid Schizophrenic since 1992. I would like to hear stories about other Schiz experiences that were Grandiose.For Example: During my last Med Change I became very Psychotic. I wanted to goto a nearby Buddhist Dharma Center that was about an hour and a half away. I drove well.. I didnt speed or violate traffic laws. However the whole trip to this place I thought People were shooting at me. I thought Snipers were firing at me and Assassins were driving by and shooting at me. I would feel the bullets but they didnt hurt.. It was like my Body healed right after the shot. The whole trip to this place was just filled with people trying to kill me. Now This was a Grandiose experience because I thought I was invincible. I wasnt being stupid by it. It wasnt like I was gonna get a gun and shoot myself.. I just thought I was surviving attacks.I'm just curious about what others stories are that are on the Grandiose scale..
