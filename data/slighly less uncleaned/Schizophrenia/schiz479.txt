Êperceiving realityIs it common to have problems perceiving reality for someone who has been diagnosed with schizoaffective?ÊIf you do, please post here and describe what kinds of issues are most affected by the disorder.I do have problems perceiving reality. I don't hear things or see things, but my mind is tormented much of the time because I'm trying to believe in what I think is real, but it doesn't come naturally and it pains me to try so hard. Usually it centers around religion and spiritual issues.Just wondering if anybody else has the same problem. Does it get better?
