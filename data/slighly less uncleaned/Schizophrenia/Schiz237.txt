I can't rely on my dreams I can't rely on my old skeems. its so hard to break free for my illness that every day it becomes what kills us never knowing what the mind my do. Never knowing what to do. living in parwarish moment. never saving what is best for us choices we have our view and view but who is this sick point of view. They that laugh at you! Lord don't laugh when I come to you and ask for the things I do you may have your struggles to but our lives together is not to view.they speak of something that they cure me soon as if the research was there to soon.maybe years down the road 80% is what I'm told.but I will take what I can get.cuss life now an"t earth a ????.
