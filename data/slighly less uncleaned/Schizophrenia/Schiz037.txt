Intrusive Thoughtsby WhiteCrow » Tue Apr 07, 2015 10:52 amHi there I have schizophrenia and OCD, I regually get horrible intrusive thoughts which create mass anxiety within me. I would like to ask other peoples experiences on this, as I often ponder, My Intrusive thoughts are like the thoughts of a 'Violent, Murdering, Sex Offender,', yet my character is nothing like that. Am I inherently Evil, or is this just my horrible condition??? Need some help, because its killing me having to avoid friends and people because of these awful thoughts that i just cannot control. Does anybody else have anything similar? If so, how do/did you cope with them?I have had some CBT over 6 years ago, but need to speak about this to a professional, but there is just no help for me in that regards right now. Anyone have any experiences and or help on this subject???
