ÊHello everyone..need help.Hello, I'm new here and this is the first time I've ever posted in a mental health/schizophrenia forum. I've had three different diagnoses over the years one of them being Schizophrenia. I am currently waiting to get another assessment done since I'm showing symptoms of Schizophrenia but not anything else. I am also not currently on my medication, even though I was on Risperidone but it wasn't working. I am currently very symptomatic, hearing voices that I do not believe are hallucinations anymore and my family says that I'm delusional but I don't think I am. I believe that what is happening is very real and if they'd only see that and believe me then I know I could help them. Since I know that I've been "chosen" by two entities named Him and Six that are from a different dimension then ours. I've been chosen to stop the epidemic of people in society (and two people in my family) who are contaminated with technology inside their skin that is being used to control and steal their thoughts. I've been doing extremely well thanks to Him and Six at not becoming contaminated myself but because of this I'm very paranoid and scared about going to the doctor because I believe they'll try to contaminate me. No one in my family (I live with my dad, sister, her girlfriend and my boyfriend) really know how to handle what I'm going through and they don't really understand. They're being as supportive as they can but right now I don't believe that I need to be hospitalized and my dad is taking care of me anyway. I've been dealing with this ever since I had my first psychotic break at 16 and I'll be 24 next month. I signed up here to meet other people who are going through or have went through the same thing as me and who truly understand. I wish that I could just be normal and I feel like such a burden on my family because they have to deal with me.
