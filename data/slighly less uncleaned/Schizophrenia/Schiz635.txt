ÊTerrifying nightmare inside of another. I'm terrified now that I know I'm awake.I just had a terrifying nightmare inside of another. There was these possessed dolls that were trying to kill me. But only I could see them move. My mom kept yelling at me that they hadn't moved and that I needed to be committed. Every house I went in, they were there. I tried explaining it to my mom but she just kept her usual "you're full off ******** Amber." I couldn't go inside anyone's house and I was stuck outside with weird green gooey spiderwebs everywhere. I was sitting in my driveway just crying because I was so terrified. My mom kept coming outside, telling me I was being stupid and I kept yelling back at her to have me committed. She kept saying no. So I kept yelling back that I would call 911 on myself. Then I thought I woke up in my now sisters room and I thought I was awake. My sister was using the computer at the end of the bed and I kept asking her to find my phone because I couldn't see or find it and I was too scared to get off the bed. Then in horror movie style, she slowly turned her head with a huge smile and said "Ashley is not here. We're back." in the scariest voice ever. I jolted awake and now I'm terrified. I was wondering why I was so tired but then seen its only 3:35.Now I'm terrified I'm still not awake. My boyfriend doesn't want to hear my dream because possessed dolls scare him badly as well.ÊI'm trying so hard not to cry. I've taken my Xanax but it doesn't seem to be working which is why I think I'm still in my nightmare.ÊI'm suicidal at this point because I'm so tired of living this life. Schizophrenia is such a horrible disorder. My voices are just making things worse. I'm terrified to get off of the bed.Ê
