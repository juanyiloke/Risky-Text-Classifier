I am not sure how I feel about it. I just feel like some of my life is "hellish" and apparently it is legal to do it to me, like my super at work who harasses me daily. I went to the police and to my uppers at work that are above her and got not very far.suggestions?judyp.s. she -- the super -- mutters under her breath nastinesses to me designed to hurt me and also she tries to turn the rest of the staff to hating me sometimes in front of me even.
