My Fiance is Schizophrenic and having trouble with apathy. He just got out of the psychiatric hospital 2 days ago. Psychiatrists have told me that it's okay to let him have a few breaks to lay in bed when the day is stressful, these breaks are limited to about 20 minutes. My question is, how do I get him out of bed when he is resistant to the agreed upon allotment of time for these breaks? Trying to convince him to do little activities or go for a walk or even do something he enjoys isn't working. Please help!
