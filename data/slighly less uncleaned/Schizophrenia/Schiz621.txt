ÊIs this a smell hallucination?Today I was out shopping and I went into a shop, and from the moment I went in, It absolutely stank of rotten eggs. The smell was so bad, that I was trying to stop myself from gagging. I tried to move to the opposite end of the shop to make it go away, but it was just as bad. There were several people in the shop, and they seemed perfectly content, and it seemed like they couldn't smell it. I had to leave the shop very quickly, as I felt like I was going to throw up or choke.Could this have been a smell hallucination?I wouldn't have thought so, however the smell was extremely bad, and nobody else seemed bothered by it.
