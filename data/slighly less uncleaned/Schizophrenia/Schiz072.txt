It seems like my thoughts can't escape me.However, I'm not sure anyone will get the message. I feel so terrified and stuck inside that even if I were to talk to someone and not in complete panic, they wouldn't understand.So I'm looking for the best option and not just wait until things get so bad that I end up at the hospital.The day feels like torture. I feel like I have to undergo tremendous exercises just to remain placid.Last night, and sometimes during the day, a low tone voice keeps repeating over and over 'Help me'. I keep asking what to do and last time it told me to buy a gun.Now I have another voice telling my to defile myself over and over, but I won't because I don't think it's healthy; on the other hand wishing for others to be murdered because they show such lack of empathy and boast pride. I recall "I wish for the Earth to shake".I feel dead but conscious. I didn't know humans could feel like this.Any advice? I think it's worth fighting for the positive. I've seen that a strong negative can be attained with willpower, why not the other way around?I grew up in a religious family and sometimes the words "hell" keeps me from finding peace.Sorry. That must be a cringe read. Thanks.
