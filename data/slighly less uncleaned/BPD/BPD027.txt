I feel so lostby starlia » Sat Jun 06, 2015 5:24 amI was cuddle buddies with someone for a year. then tired of them not feeling the same way i wanted to end it. so they asked me out and told me they felt the same way. since then its been crazy. they told me they loved me they wanted to marry me they wanted to have kids with me. now they are saying they only meant they loved me as a friend. and that they are gay. I have just lost it. i keep contacting sending messages. they range between i dont want to see you again to im sorry lets be friends. my head is everywhere at the moment. i keep crying, i think about sucide but dont actually want to do it. i am only recently becoming aware of my long term diagnosis of bordaline personality disorder. and i guess i just feel like i need some support. maybe here. because all im doing is loosing people. and im afraid. my moods im just so impulsive and always making a fool of myself. and people dont understand. i often feel crazy and admit myself to hospital and they think i waste there time. i just want to feel normal.
