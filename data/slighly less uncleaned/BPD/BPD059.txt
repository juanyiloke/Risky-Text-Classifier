Do you tend to feel like you have an alter ego?by Ella55 » Tue Nov 06, 2012 6:51 pmI'm not sure if alter ego is the right word here, it's more like two personalities, but I can't think of another word for it.Sometimes (okay, more than sometimes) I feel like I have an alter ego. There is one me, who is shy, self conscious, almost passive, and calm. This me is devoted to her boyfriend and wants to settle down with him at some point, and longs for the stability of a family life. The other me is aggressive, almost cocky, flirtatious, and has quite a temper. This other me would rather have flirt or have flings with men then settle down with someone.I think the person who has to deal with the two sides of my personality the most is definitely my boyfriend, just the other day I completely lost it with him for just a small thing, and lashed out and tried to push him away as much as possible. After I had gotten it all out I felt so guilty and apologized, and tried to pull him back so to speak. I also struggle with the fact that I feel attracted to other men even though I love him. I have never cheated on him nor do I actually have feelings for other people, it is more that I need them to be attracted to me, if that makes sense.. I seek that high of having someone have feelings for me.Finding out that I have BPD is recent for me, so I am just trying to figure out if others feel like this too?
