New BPD member in need *trigger?*by AnxiousFox » Fri May 29, 2015 8:52 pmHi, I'm a female who was diagnosed with Borderline PD, I have a new born and things are going amazing in that area of my life. I'm a very stable mom, actually way better than I, or anyone thought. Her father and I have had a horrible relationship *trigger* He emotionally, mentally, and physically abused me for almost 3 years, even when I was pregnant *end trigger*He has isolated me before, making it seem like I'm the one who stayed inside his room all day every day from choice. He cheated on me more times than I can count (or probably even know), he has gas lighted me into oblivion, he lies and makes up realities of himself to portray on to other people, and he has very violent outbreaks. He manipulates people, and I can just go on and on. He has never been to a therapist because "they are for crazy people, and I'm not crazy"A few days ago we agreed to try to be together again, and part of the agreement is individual therapy, and a clean slate. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but try telling that to someone with BPD and "in love" with someone like him. I've heard it all, we both have. I would really like to make friends, get advice/support, and try to subdue my disorder naturally. I have taken medication before but I don't like it. I don't even take medicine when I'm sick, have a tooth ache, or anything. So I wanna try to just work on my psyche naturally. Thanks for reading
