I Have Borderline Personality DisorderArgued with my mom today... She«s in another country with my brother... and she left me here... It«s hard comunicating with her, she doesn«t get me... My family should be close, but we aren«t. I wish I could have some type of bond with her. But then she gets me so mad. people don«t understand why I get so mad. I want to tell them I«m borderline, despite not being diagnosed, I know I am. I just can«t tell anybody. I imagine her sweeping it under the rug, if I told her... when will I be set free? It«s like I can only tell "you" (virtual people), what«s really going on in my life. Everytime someone gets close, I always push them away... why can«t I just ask for help? why do I have to be stubborn?... and quiet...
