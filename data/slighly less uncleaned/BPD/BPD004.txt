at times i take my bpd too seriously*tw*by jaus tail » Tue Jun 09, 2015 4:55 ami think the bpd makes me superpowerful. it fills me with delusions. like:i imagine scenarios where there'd be a crises n i'd say: 'dont worry, i'll handle it.'one fellow: 'how will you do it? no one can do it.'i'd smile n say, 'well i have bpd. n u dont know what borderlines are capable'i often get delusional about it and say, 'oh dont worry, i'm a borderline, i can do it. my brain is 'blah blah blah...you dont know what a borderline can do...i'm a bpd...'as if bpd gives me superpowers.
