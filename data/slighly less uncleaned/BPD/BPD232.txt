ÊAm I wrong am I so abnormalSo I feel like my life is slipping away from me my moods change just like the British weather I put a front on that smile people will see but behind it is my real face the darkness in my eyes the pain like I have been hit by a bus the shell of a person I don't recognise in the mirror. I have friends and some family and I know it's hard for them to understand and I do try but I have serious trust issues you have hid this illness for 20 years the can popped open when my mum suddenly died and the emotions could not be held back for long. So this is nearly a year on and I'm stil finding it hard to learn I have a personality disorder as my doctor wrote when I was on a ward for 3 mths "multiple personality disorder" didn't have it explained to me was left on my own until recently I started Stepps a cbt course and the dr explained what I was feeling inside and it's normal for someone like me to feel like that. So I'm on week 13 and trying to put things I'm leaving in practice like communication so please tell me if I'm selfish today my so called boyfriend and I talk he wants to help me he feels he can do more ok deep breath and tell him how low I am how worried I am for my safety and how scared I am to let people know as it means letting my guard down and my self harming has got worse lately. So I wait for a reply and are you ready this is my reply...... watch channel 5 wtf I turn the tv on turn it to channel 5 to see he would rather me watch a programme on people with lots of tattoos what the hell am I wrong to think this am I blowing it up I told him a bit later that I felt hurt and upset and he has no idea why even though I expressed it on my blog but yet I will listen to him minor issues when he thinks they are major even though I want to shot grow up. So I've walked away to me this has been the last straw. Please someone tell me am I wrong to think like this. Thank you
