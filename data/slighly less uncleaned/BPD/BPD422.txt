ÊWhy, why why do I do this?It's like I just don't learn. I can't sleep and I simply, blindly PANIC!!!ÊLike what is going to happen if I can't sleep? I'm retired, in my own home. I can sleep or not whenever I want to.But, no. I head for medication. I'll take two of this and one of that and then in a little while I'll take a few more. Sometimes I sleep and sometimes not.BUT, I always feel dreadful the next day. Depressed and feeling the "S" word. Why do I do it? Why do I panic? I have to stop taking these cocktails every time I can't sleep. But when it happens it's like I'm possessed and not in my right mind. It all scares me.
