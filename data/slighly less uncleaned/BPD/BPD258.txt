Ê"Normal People"I've recently been chatting to someone and I think they want it to get more serious. I am worried, though, as she seems quite "normal", I suppose (Not that I think anybody is really 'normal', as the word lacks a universal definition, but you know what I mean) however I am worried that once she finds out about my BPD/self harm scars etc... That our friendship and everything might go down the drain. I like her, but for this reason I'm holding off and being passive because I'm anxious about her finding out I'm having all these issues. To be honest this is just one of many things. I deliberately don't go out and see my friends because I'm worried I'll have an episode and then they won't want to be friends with me anymore. Has anyone experienced this and has helpful advice? Just don't know what to do, as I'm becoming more lonely and depressed as I avoid people, but every time I think about going out anywhere I get massive anxiety. My doctor thinks I might be agoraphobic...
