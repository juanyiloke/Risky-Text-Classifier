ÊBeing alone seriously makes me crazyMy boyfriend, who I live with, is working out of town for the next 12 weeks. I am seriously losing it. I am over texting, crying, self harming and pushing pushing pushing. He has made it very clear that he isn't going anywhere and deep down I believe him, but then I just get this impulse to mess everything up. I get so overwhelmed with loneliness and missing him that it feels like I can't go on. I guess I just want to know if anyone has felt like this as well and maybe how I can make myself feel better.
