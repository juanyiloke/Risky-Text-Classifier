Êis this a BPD thing?ok i am sorry again for posting so much on here but i am new to this BPD thing and not exactly sure what is what at the moment. So sometimes i hear voices and stuff and like it is like whispering and it is outside my head and i also well ok this bit gets kind of complicated i feel like there are demons/bad spirits all around my house and i feel like one of them is waiting for me to take me somewhere cause i kind of well it is hard to explain but i dont always feel human and sometimes i feel like i am related to the devil and it is super hard to describe but i am wondering if this has to do with BPD or not...
