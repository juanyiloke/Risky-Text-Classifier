ÊI hate fall in love easily...Since my childhood (4 years to start) i've always felt the sensations of ''falling in love'' with someone (even a cartoon character) EVERY YEAR, it was like i couldn't even fight against, i've fall in love many times in my life (i'm 18).So...i'm starting to like a guy i've met on friday, last week... and i just think of him, i just want to know about him, i just want him by my side. And that's i mean: talk to him, sexual contact, be friends with him. But i don't want to date him, but this is not because i'm already dating, but it's because i'm a bit ''scared' or even better: insecure about dating someone again.Since 16 years i discovered i was obsessed about falling in love, the sensations of the feeling, of the passion. It's my drug. Or one of my drugs. It's horrible because i suffer, but i need that. I need that feeling. It's good, but at the same time i suffer. So sometimes i feel really confused: I like the person, yes. I feel attracted to the person yes. But i'm scared if it's only because of the sensation.I hate having feelings, i really hate that. It's always intense, so masochist and sadistic at the same time... i suffer so much and a rollercoaster of feelings, everytime.And many times when i discovered something ''bad'' or ''oh this person thinks this way...ugh'' or something i get a bit disappointed i start to...seeing this person more of a illusion, erasing these things of them. A mechanism of my mind to not losing interest and to not lose the sensation of passion.
