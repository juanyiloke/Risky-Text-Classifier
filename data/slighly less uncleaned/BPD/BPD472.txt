ÊIs anyone like me?So I was diagnosed at the age of 18 with borderline......every single symptom is me. However.....I am overly sweet and nice. If I feel anything, I hold it inside.....no one knows me (sees my mood swings or is the victim of them) unless your close to me and I feel comfort in our relationship and know you wont leave me.ÊI have a clowns face that I have perfected and Im just wondering if anyone else is like me?Sometimes I fake so much cheerfulness that I actually believe that is how I am.ÊGotta love crazy, lol.Ê
