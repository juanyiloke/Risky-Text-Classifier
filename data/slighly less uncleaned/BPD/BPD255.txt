Ê5-6 different personalitiesit was a weird experience i had today, i had a appointment and when i was talking to the psychologist, i heard myself, I like turned into 5-6 different people, from the way i sat, to how I talked, and my BF was watching me like he wanted to get the heck outta there. I wanted to get outta there too, but i stayed, I felt kinda scared, annoyed, and confused about this event. I've noticed the different personalities I had so many times, but I'm always on the go and never think about it. i remember everything about my day, I don't black out or anything, but i think its just normal for me to be like this, a coping mechanism for all the wrong things in my life. There's a shy one, a very child-like one that just nods and avoids eye=contact , a male one who hates everything including me, a really over female one...like you know....maybe another one, and me.ÊI think i understand and accept this now. i've been like this for many years and its so odd that i cant change this about Me, but i guess me will have to be We.
