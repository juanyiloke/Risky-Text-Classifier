Êwhere is my other half????Really having a challenging time at the moment. It seems to me that half of "me" is missing an actual part of my "self" or person. Imagine the effect/affect this has on functioning in daily life! It's an extremely dysfunctional and causes a lot of distress....for a long time and for everyone in my vicinity. Consequences are lots of shame.ÊHaven't spoken about this to therapists/clergy, afraid to, as they seem to imply that it's b.s. who knows maybe it is b.s., but it feels horrible, and if I could cope in a healthy way I would.Do I want to change? Of course! This seems like one of those odd mind things that I haven't a clue how to attend to in a healthy way.ÊHalf of me is missing, no idea where it went.Kind of a venty flavor here, even a rant of frustration/irritation....Jade
