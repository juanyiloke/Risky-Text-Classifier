ÊLast choice diagnosisHi I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. When I became aware of the diagnosis and researched on it, it left me feeling that it was a last choice option. Prior to this I was told I suffer from adjustment disorder as well as depression. A previous psychiatrist was considering if I may be suffering from bipolar disorder. All this has left me in a state of confusion. What's wrong with me I know I'm not "normal" I can't control certain aspect of myself but I have been left in a state feeling like an alien, if you get what I mean.I'm at a total loss with my life
