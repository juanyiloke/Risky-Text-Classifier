 Can't handle my impulses!Hi, I recently got diagnosed with BPD finally! After thinking for the last god knows how many years I was just a bad, mixed up person. The thing is I am having a real problem controlling my reckless behavior.I often partake in drug taking, drink driving and spending sprees as well as putting myself in unsafe situations. I then lie to my family about these things and then experience intense anger when they question me about it. Self harming and crying hysterically. I just feel like I am losing control. I don't want to constantly be hurting other people. Does anybody have any tips on trying to control impulsive behavior? I'm really struggling to cope. I left my family home last night and have came to my nan's until I can afford my own place. I feel like being on my own is best. I feeling extremely lost and mixed up lately. Like everything is getting worse not better. I feel like no one understands me and that they think I'm just behaving this way because I want to. I am on antidepressants and a mild sedative. I go to psychotherapy sessions but that's only just started. It doesn't seem to help though. My behavior and emotions have been completely erratic since I was 13 and I am just so tired. Because I got sexual assaulted when I was 15 everybody thought I was just playing up and attention seeking so its only now (I'm 26) that I have actually been diagnosed. I just want to feel safe and normal.I want to have a normal relationship with someone, when I meet somebody I like I feel really strongly for them, then I end up getting these horrible feeling of wanting them to not be anywhere near me, and when they touch me my skin crawls. Then I end up saying the most vile things to them. Sorry I seem to have totally rambled I guess I just feel like everything is getting on top of me
