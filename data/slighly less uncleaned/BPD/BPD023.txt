Feel like hurting yourself if you are attracted to someone?by Mary24 » Fri Jun 05, 2015 9:21 pmI was recently attracted to a guy. Shortly before that I was really into this guy and I was OCD messaging him. I got over him but I still messaged him. He has me blocked. I just never stopped. Before I got over him I never hurt myself but always had that feeling. Now I got it again from being so attracted to the recent guy. I don't do it, but it just makes me feel so bad like a super bad feeling creates that impulse. Just ranting. It's so annoying. So, I can't like anyone because it just creates all these bad things in me.
