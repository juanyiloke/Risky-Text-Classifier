ÊThis sucks ...I'm sorry, but I HATE this sh*t. If BPD were a person I'd tell it to go to hell. It's in my interpersonal relationships were I really come face-to-face with this.Sometimes, I think I'm healed; I think I'm the percentage of people who outgrows BPD. But, then it's there, where it's always been and it slaps me in my face laughing at me.I remember swearing sometime ago that I wouldn't get involved in another romantic relationship for a long time .... actually, until some of my issues had "gone away". Then being single and having lots of friends made me think I was cured. I was ready.... And now here I am again with a great person and totally just letting it rip; I'm f**king up all over the place. It's like Pandora's box reopened. I mean, WTH....Sure, my partner could be more supportive; he's not an angel. But I'm not talking about him. I know what problems I brought to the table, and I hate myself for having those stupid f**king problems. It's like "get over yourself, there are people dying out there"!!! But, isn't it the same thing- dying inside and dying on the outside? I really think it is ....
