 struggling to cope with bpdHello! Im new to this forum so hello everyone- i was diagnosed with bpd 3 months ago after my husband divorced me im only 24 years old- i have always suffered from impulses and bad bad mood swings and feelings that i struggle to cope with and find overwhelming! I always thought i just had a crazy and nasty personality until i decided that i couldnt continue to live like this and sought help- im struggling to come to terms with it- i am pushing everyone away i feel like giving up i just ruin everything the horrid moods come all of a sudden over something so silly!! Ive just finished group therapy for coping skills i dont feel it helped when i was diagnosed they said i had emotional dysfunction but when i went ti the therapy i was then in a group of everyone with borderline this is how i found out all symptoms fit with me sadly when u feel happy i think i dont have borderline but then i get bought back to reality when i sink again!! I dont feel like i have my own wants and desires it depends who i am with and what they are doing my values and opinions change all of the time how can i live with being this way forever
