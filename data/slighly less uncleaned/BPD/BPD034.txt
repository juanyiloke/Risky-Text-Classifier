Is there anything I can do in this situation that is normal?by Mary24 » Thu Jun 04, 2015 12:21 amI have a crush on a stranger. He has noticed me for a long time. We interacted a short time a very long time ago. I never liked him but it suddenly switched and I really do. However, the moment that happened his attention stopped. I assume there is nothing I can do that won't be weird? I stalked him on FB already. He works at a store I go to. He just stopped noticing me at the same time I got feelings about him. My crush is just pretty huge - like probably too big to be normal.
