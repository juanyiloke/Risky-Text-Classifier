ÊBad timesLiving in a very tough moment. Waiting for a new appointment with my psychiatrist next week and a new therapist next month, reading lots of self-help books and whatever can help me to overcome my now situation.ÊI'm thinking about how easy is to offer help when you feel good. When someone come here telling about his/her struggles and you feel some kind of balance in your life, you give suggestions, you offer the best you can about how to overcome a bad moment or how to improve his/her life. You do believe what you say, you do know that any tip (reading an specific self-help book, filling life with significant activities, healthy habits...) can help the person.ÊBut, when you are feeling hopeless, all these messages, all these tips lack of sense for you and sound as a foreign language.ÊI'm not trying to mean the help you can get from someone is meaningless or unhelpfull, in fact I think it's very necessary for the one who offers and the one who receives it. I only wanted to give the view of the person who is in a desperate situation. How hard is for him/her to find any relief when (s)he is in a stuck moment.
