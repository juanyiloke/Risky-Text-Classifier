I Have Borderline Personality DisorderWell, I did it again.ÊI let my thoughts bubble up into a fit of rage. I am so bitter and cold today. It all started this morning. Waking up , realizing this is it for now. I am stuck at home almost always. This doesn't bother me everyday because I love being a full time mom. What I don't love is having bpd and it ruining my life. I talked some real junk to the man I love so dearly. I hope be doesn't hold these things against me. He is one of the reasons I enjoy life so much. I said I did it again because I was with someone for awhile and he would describe it as being a nightmare. I'm being honest because I think it's important. There is a great deal of negativity flowing through my body. I was raised that way. I don't want to be that way though. Sure, everyone had their moments but I was raised in a emotionally unstable house hold. I'm letting that all go though. My biggest worry is destroying all the wonderfulThings around me. I am really embarrassed by some of my actions, thoughts and words.Anyways, I just needed to write this down. I feel better now. I have to stop getting like this. When will I learn I am in control? I hope I'll be okay. I am going to look into this online DBT group. That may be a good idea. It's obvious I have mental problems at least today it showed to him. I really love him.ÊIt's like in the beginning of girl, interrupted "Susanne your hurting everyone around you" I may be doing this to the one who loves me. I'm sorry.
