I Have Borderline Personality DisorderAh,so shared vision turns out my founder is delusional.He wants this grand idea of a vision to be executed and cant even put a ******* business plan.Meanwhile he is derailing all my ideas as lame,won't work,blah blah,and taking ones he likes to talk to specific mentors who will give him intel who will then mysteriously help us gain money.I think he is full of ****.I can get this done,and my borderline smells another narcissist.Only this time,I am not remotely attracted to him,and when I question these things he starts to character assassinate me.
