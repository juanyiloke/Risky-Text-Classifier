need guidance for pursing MS Electrical Engineering MSby jaus tail » Fri May 22, 2015 6:42 amHello,I know this isn't an academic forum but i've got all my friends here so thought, why not give it a try.i'm thinking of pursuing ms in electrical engineering from germany n i'm scared, nervous. what if the issues dont go? today morning i woke up acting like a kid.if and its a big if, if i get the admission n all goes smoothly, then the good news is i'll be away from the toxic environment where i was raisedbut the bad news is what if the issues chase me. i'm scared about everything?also if anyone's got any idea about how germany is it'd be nice. do i have to know german or is english sufficient?
