Is Faith Even Possible?by batcap » Thu May 21, 2015 11:24 pmAs I continue to struggle one of the hardest things to cope with is the complete loss of my faith. I used to be fairly religious but as things have worsened I've gotten to the point where I just don't believe. It's not that I don't believe that there's a god It's more that I just don't see the point in it. If there is a hell I'm more then likely going there so what's the purpose. I see myself as so bad and beyond fixing or saving that its just all so hopeless. I can't even consistently tell the truth to my therapist let alone pray, depending on what way my freaking mood swings who knows what I'll say in prayer.Does anyone else have any struggles with faith or maybe god and BPD just aren't compatible...
