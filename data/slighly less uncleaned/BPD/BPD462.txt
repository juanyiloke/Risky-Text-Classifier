ÊFound solutionI have always needed street drugs to fix my problems. Pharmaceuticals don't take care of my severe depression. I could not figure out how to get them. Bright idea - go to narcotics anonymous meetings. Some of the people there are court ordered. They may still be using and will know where the dealers are so now I will get references so I won't be doing it alone. It will now be so easy. Wow my pain had to get this severe so that my brain came up with this so easy idea. Yea no more depression. I am old so by the time I get addicted I will be dead anyway so no negatives that I can see. Party here I come.
