Newly diagnosedby NatashaGabber » Fri Jun 05, 2015 9:18 pmHi, I was diagnosed as BPD 2 years ago but only told this week. I want to know how I will manage the rest of my life, will i be able to work again, (was a probation officer for 10 years....with numerous breakdowns ). will i ever have a healthy relationship?i just don't know how to manage my BPD, i've been offered CBT which i'm due to start in a month or so but will this help me?any help anyone can offer is appreciated, i'm still coming to terms with it myself. i don't know what to tell people, if anything.
