Rejection and criticismby CoconutIce » Mon Jun 01, 2015 10:26 pmHello. I hope you might be able to help me a little bit. I will try to support you also.I'm in my late thirties. I have bipolar disorder and traumatic experiences. I don't have a diagnosis of bpd but I have 'vulnerable traits' which I think means I have similar problems to those with bpd. 'Mild' they said. It doesn't feel mild. It's crippling this pain.My bipolar mood is good but my heart aches. My dad rejected me my whole life. He had a new family and so didn't bother with me much. My mum caused a bit of that but still...Dad I cut off a few years ago. Too much pain. He has schizoaffective disorder hence my bipolar disorder. I have very low self esteem. I'm off work and isolated as I fear rejection and criticism. It makes me suicidal. Isolating more and more.I had a good childhood. Loved and safe. However as an adult (possibly as a child at times too although I don't remember) my mum is also critical. Verbally abusive. Stonewalling. Only last week she sat on my sofa and told me she had to end our relationship permanently. That evening she behaved as though she had not said this and was nice as pie. It's been like this 20% of the time for about 20 years. Again my self esteem has been affected.No to counselling and psychiatrists. They too criticise and reject. Judge.I'm lost and hurt.
