 newly diagnosedHi all...i just got diagnosed with bpd...although if i'm gonna be honest with myself (and all of you) it's been there since i was a teen and no one bothered to address it until i landed myself inpatient this year, and a very harsh man pointedly addressed it. I, now, six months later am just beginning work on acceptance, as this is something i reeeeeallllllly didn't want to deal with, but lets be honest- i'm the poster child of borderline personality disorder. so, i'm turning to you, internet support network... how do i find my place of acceptance towards having and living and dealing with bpd? i know a LOT about dbt already, i'm working towards getting into a group, and reading some on this, but internally... i just don't want to accept myself. i've accepted my other diagnoses through the years, but i'm learning to realize they were just a means of regulating my emotions and covering the underlying bpd.  so here i am, uncovered, feeling pretty vulnerable, and not sure of next steps. any advice - books, workbooks, words of wisdom- anything- would be so helpful right now
