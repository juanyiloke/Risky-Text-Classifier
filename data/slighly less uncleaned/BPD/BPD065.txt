Your way of coping with/controlling triggers?by 0siris » Sat May 30, 2015 2:53 amHi everyone! *waves*I have been recently diagnosed with BPD and by far the most difficult thing for me to cope with is the emotional turmoil you endure during a trigger. The extent of what I could be capable of concerns me as it's completely unpredictable. I do see a clinical psychologist regularly who recommends mindfulness techniques. I see the benefits behind it, however in the moment I am far too angry and emotional to even consider applying these techniques. Which brings me to my question, I am interested to know how you guys who also live with this deal with it? Any techniques you find that help in coping with or controlling them? Any advice is most appreciated xx
