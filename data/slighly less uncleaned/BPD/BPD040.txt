All all "waif" guys total messes?by Tahawus » Wed Jun 03, 2015 5:41 pmI am a masculine gay guy who really like "waif" type men -- shy, introverted, slim. The kind of guy who was picked on as a kid and I just want to protect. I think this is because:1) My first love was a waif boy.2) I am somewhat shy myself.3) My borderline part equates "shyness" with security.Well, in thinking about my current waif boy (he is actually 24), I came to the conclusion that every one I either dated or knew causally is a mess emotionally, with all of them seeming to have sexual compulsion and anger issues.I have had some good talks with my BF and I am again surprised that somebody with such a sweet, soft exterior who is also quite kind and gentle can have a compulsion for rough, dirty sex.I am wondering if my "prince" really exists? Are all waifs like this?If I was only into bears, lol...
