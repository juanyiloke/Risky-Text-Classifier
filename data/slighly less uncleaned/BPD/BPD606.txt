I Have Borderline Personality DisorderHaving BPD, depression and social anxiety and trying to be a good wife and good mother is a big struggle. I know I'm not good enough for my husband, he deserves the world, someone who absolutely adores him and loves him. I'm always in doubt of my feelings, half of the time I barely want to get out of my bed, I feel like such a terrible mother, a complete failure, my kids deserve a mother who doesn't have a mental illness. I keep thinking I should leave my husband, I don't even know if I love him, I don't feel butterflies when he touches me, I don't miss him when I go away and he's rarely capable of turning me "on", it's a struggle enough as it is get me to even consider having intercourse. I'm bored of my life, been a mum since I was 16, I want nothing more than my kids to be happy but at the same time I wish I was happy. Will hopefully see my psych again asap as I feel so guilty.
