ÊI can't sleep.Due to work, I can usually only grab about 4-5 hours randomly during the day to get some sleep. I'm currently standing a night shift that goes until 2AM but I don't really mind since I can't seem to sleep. You'd think I'd be exhausted after a 20-hour workday (and I am!) but I can't make my mind slow down enough to sleep. All my degrading thoughts, flashbacks of things I messed up on recently, and conversations gone sour fly through my head until I find out that I've lost 3 hours of my precious sleep time.What are some things that help you calm down at night (if you have problems sleeping)?
