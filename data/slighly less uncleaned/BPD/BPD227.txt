ÊHi pals, please help me out, I need some examples of irrational anger responses.As the title suggests I'd like to hear other peoples BPD 'irrational response' stories. What happened to make you so angry, sad, or irritable? Did other people with you think you were being 'silly' or 'over dramatic'? Last did you also know that you were over reacting, but realize that you were powerless to your response, and kind of just have to sit back and let it happen. That usually what happens to me.ÊI fit all of the criteria for BPD, but every time I'm to the point of trying to accept it for what it is, my brain makes excuses like "Oh no, your reactions aren't that over the top (you may meet all the other criteria) but freaking out and having uncontrollable rages over very little things, no you don't have BPD." I know it seems ridiculous that my brain can fool me like that, but I have a long standing history of trying to water down my problems so that other people don't worry about me. When BPD finally came as my diagnosis I felt so much relief, and I felt like everything made sense for once, but now it's like my brains telling me my reactions aren't 'BPD enough'ÊLike nothing I do is ever good enough, I can't even have a mental illness properly.ÊAnyone else experience this?
