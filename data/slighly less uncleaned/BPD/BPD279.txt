ÊI can't afford to lose more peopleEvery close friend I've had, has walked out of my life. It's always the same reason:I hear these same things so often that it has lost meaning. It still upsets me each time, to be put down in that way. I am in therapy, I have three daily anti-anxiety/anti-depressants. I'm trying. It's so hard to wake up in the morning when what I hope for is for a quick, painless death. Am I really so horrid to have as a friend?ÊMy ex-friends put me down and choose to walk out of my life because I'm too much of a burden.ÊPerhaps this means I have no choice but to realise that I am undeserving of friendship and I am to face the same lonely existence.
