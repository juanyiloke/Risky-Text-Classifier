I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI have BPD and feel that I am treated as a drama queen if I have to see a doctor or attend a& e. Since I have been diagnosed, my support system has disappeared with gps passing buck to psychiatrist to dbt training.I nearly threw myself in river last night...was talked down and ended up seeing a gp. She gave me the option to either go.voluntary or involuntary to psych ward. I eventually went voluntarily to emergency department. I was assessed waited for 3 hours then sent home..no extra meds or anything to help with urges. I am still suffering but don't know where to turn to: gp won't help, A&E are useless and my counsellor can't really help with this.I am finding it hard to continue on this way.
