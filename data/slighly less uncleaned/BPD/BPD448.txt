ÊSadI'm so incredibly sad. Lonely, mainly. I miss my family. I miss my (former) best friend. I wish I could just go hang out with any of them, have a cup of coffee or something. I miss the fact that someone who knew me well knew what was happening in my life. Right now, I feel like a feather just floating along, nowhere to land.ÊI have happy days, sometimes they last for a couple of weeks where I can keep up the positive self-talk. Where I'm eating well, sleeping well, taking care of myself. But I always, inevitably, hit a wall and back down into the pit I go.I am really struggling to keep my focus, to concentrate on studying and on my patient prep every week. I'm in the home stretch...I can't give up now. But I feel like I'm losing the will or even a reason to keep going.
