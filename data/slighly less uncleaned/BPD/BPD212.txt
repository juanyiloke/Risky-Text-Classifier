 Anyone else finished DBT?Hi guys any of ye finished the DBT course?What Iv observed lately is I don't laugh anymore since I'm finished , all my emotions have died down to where I only acknowledge them in my head , if i find something funny I don't laugh I just acknowledge it in my head by saying " that was funny" Like before if I found something funny I wud b in knots and I had a laugh that wud make other people laugh , I sound like a donkey But since doing mindfulness I feel almost dead a better word wud be CALM I like this and I don't , I miss laughing out loud at things
