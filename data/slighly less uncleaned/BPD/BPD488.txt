 Feeling quite on edge with no where to go.I am sorry for posting a lot on here but I am feeling really bad and it won't seem to go away I really don't know what to do anymore I don't think anyone really wants me around and ruin everything I have no one I can talk even the hotlines in my country are of no use so I can't even talk to them I can't talk to family of the little friends I have my psychologist canceled again and I don't even know if I will ever be able to face him again I have been having almost non stop panic attacks and I don't feel like I am in control at all anymore I am scared I will do something stupid but I don't know if I am scared or just waiting for it to happen even if it does no one would care though so what does it matter. I pretty much have 0 supports right now and even the crisis team would just be annoyed to see me as there is NO public health support for my age where I live and when I say none I mean literally 0 nothing oh and to top it all off I haven't slept in months.
