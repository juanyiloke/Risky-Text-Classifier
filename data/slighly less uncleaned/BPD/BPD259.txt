Êupdate to old problemSo my ex hasn't come back to my work in a long time. His mom comes sometimes but does not bother me. The last two times they came And went through my lane I bagged their groceries, I didn't ask for help. he used to tell me he thought it was funny when I tried to ignore him ( we went to the same special school of only 18 kids, it was torture) so I thought what's better than just going through the shakes and bagging his crap as fast as I can without backing down?? It worked!! He doesn't step foot in my store anymore!! I still get bad memories of him played in my head sometimes though, I'm not sure if that's normal, it's been 5 years. People have told me that it doesn't matter what he did to me and it could've been worse and that it's just my bpd making things big. I don't see how what he did Is ok, I never will. I feel like telling myself that someone who I'm not sure what to call it rape? Sexually harassed? Sexually assaulted? Me And brainwashed and told me I was ugly everyday is ok is like I'm lying to myself...that would be telling myself thats normal and anyone can do that to me. Thats holding me back alot. But I don't see him so that's good....
