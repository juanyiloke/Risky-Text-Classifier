 how do i get better?I hate the super changeable emotions and moods. i hate that i feel like everyone is picking on me. I hate that everything others say to me gets twisted in my mind and hurts me. I hate that this illness is so tied up in who i am. I start group thearpy this year in the hope of gaining some balance and control again over my thoughts and actions etc....you see i want to be a social worker and in order to let myself do that i need to be sure i can cope with what ill see and the problems of peoples lives that are sad and hurt me because they are hurting etc...i wanted to learn how to cope without resorting to self destructive methods. Also i know i need to deal with my past (i pretty much do anything i can to avoid thinking about it). Group therapy has been hard and im not sure how good it is for me.... ive a few people who have said that they think its more harmful than beneficial for me but aside form going back to individual therapy once a week i havent many options. ive been under mental health services since i was 19 and im now 27- i think ive been put in the too hard basket  The other day i saw my nurse and ended up getting angry and upset and not being able to say any of what i wanted to. her solution to everything was to quite group, quit my degree and just get a job. i think shes basing this on me having worked the previous 2 years as a caregiver- ive have very few hospital admissions or treatments ( but its partly because i ddint go- i couldnt go because i had work. i wasnt hurting myself less or anything really- i just wasnt getting it treated). So i dont think me quitting everything is the solution. but i dont know what is. I think i wanted to do 1'1 for childhood stuff but chickened out asking the other day. so will try asking again when i next see her. other then that i really dont know the solution to help me get better.
