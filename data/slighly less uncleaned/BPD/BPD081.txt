Seeing the doctorby kah80 » Tue May 26, 2015 1:56 pmI went this morning and said I think I have a personality disorder. He refused to believe it and said its 'only' depression and he won't refer me to anyone unless I have tried doubling my dose of antidepressants.I am annoyed because I know what is going on with me is more than depression. I will take the pills, and hopefully when he sees I am no better he will take things further.Why is it so hard to get someone to believe me? People who know me well know that it's more than 'just' depression. Depression is awful and I do have it, but I am sure there is more.
