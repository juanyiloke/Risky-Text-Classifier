I Have Borderline Personality DisorderJust came back from seeing the lights in natchodes. I was like so happy and excited to go on the way there. But everyone else seemed not so interested and I was like the only one happy. But after an hour of singing and laughing by myself, I began to feel myself become depressed. I put my head down because I felt this heavy sensation and I started crying. I cried for like 10 minutes. No one noticed. After that I was depressed for a long time. I tried to get happy but failed. We went to a play and afterwards I was happy again. Then I got said again. Then I got happy. We watched the fireworks over the river. We left. I thought about suicide all day today. Just wanting to die or self mutulate. Idk.
