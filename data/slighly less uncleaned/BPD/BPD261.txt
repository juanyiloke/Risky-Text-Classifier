ÊBPD..until now I didn't know it existed......all those years of suffering.I just thought I was extremely insecure and a horrible person, couldn't understand why I acted like I did in relationships..it was like torture, constantly feeling any partner I had was going to leave me, feeling everyone else was better than me in every way. The constant pressure my mind was under was immense...its kind of a relief to read posts here and realise its a disorder, and not me on my own, the only person that experiences this. All of the heartache I have gone through, not knowing and feeling ashamed of myself...I'm feeling quite emotional about it all right now, the things in my life it has ruined..feeling maybe I will never have a relationship ever again, which makes me feel very sad..I did have hope, but now I feel I just don't want to feel those feelings about anyone again, it was torturous! ....Bless you all that suffer in this way.
