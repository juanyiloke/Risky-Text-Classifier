 Can't take it anymoreI know my emotions are unstable, I understand they control me but I need them to stop Some of you know about me and my ex it isn't getting any easier at times I either feel nothing at all just numb to the world like we weren't together the other is this extreme emotional pain it hurts so much, I think about how much I miss her and all the good and don't understand how sometimes I'm just numb .I just don't want this pain but the numbness isn't any better I don't care about anyone when I'm like that I can't win go got see the psychiatrist on friday
