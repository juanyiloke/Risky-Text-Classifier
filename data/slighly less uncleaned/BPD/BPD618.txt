I Have Borderline Personality DisorderSaw the movie shame.That is exactly how it is being borderline.I think I am somewhere in between.Being Demisexual,empath and borderline is a strange **** up of emotions.You have love addiction,you chase men like a drug,you fall for the ones who you know can't love you,yet you trade sex for a connect.And break down when it does not happen,and then know what you are doing,and how ****** up this is.Strange feeling.In the end what you really want is a guy who you know will love you,no matter what.But then there is the insecurity and need.You need someone "safe" and you don't trust safe,cause safe hurts more.I think I should avoid relationships till I have a sense of self.Otherwise it is basically imprisoning yourself to be the guy's toy.Not that I mind that,but it will destroy me.Not being close to people,gives me a sense of security.Because they can't hurt me,and I don't have to pretend I am anything but what I am.Formless,and driven with some goal.Almost a good thing if you are Buddhist.That said,the moment someone will cross in my radar who is irresistible I will fall like a castle of cards and start the game again.Ah being a prisoner to my own devices.A week feels like a year,a year feels like yesterday.I am a toddler in an adult's body,well into the stuff adults do too.Whatever.I envy psychopaths. Lucky bastards.To be able to live without emotions,sounds such a gift.
