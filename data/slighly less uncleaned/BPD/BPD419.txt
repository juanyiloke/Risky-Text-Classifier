ÊTalking to my therapist about BPDToday, I'm gonna talk openly to my therapist about my suspicious that I have BPD.ÊI've been offering her signs but she seems not to understand me or perhaps she doesn't want to alarm me.ÊI think I never was diagnosed as such bc the psychiatrists only took the visible symptons; that is, depression, social anxiety and avoidance.ÊA good diagnoses have to be made taking into account the individual's past and evolution.ÊSo, I'm not surprised that I could be another borderline bad diagnosed with anything except the right one.ÊI'm very concern with a proper diagnoses bc I need the right therapy and to cure me. I'm very tired to have these downs in my life. Life is too much short to throw it on the board and I want to be happy and mainly, make happy my loved people.ÊThere is no question here. I'm writing this bc I wanted to share with you.ÊThe only person I talked about the topic was my partner. He said that it's impossible that I'm not the same as that woman who had a crush on him and phoned me and sent me nasty letters. But, I told him that there are grades in this disorder.
