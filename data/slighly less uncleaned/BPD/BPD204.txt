ÊMy bpdI am a sufferer from Borderline Personality Disorder. I don't understand the disorder much my diagnosis was once depression then bipolar then ADHD now finally BPD. First time I heard of BPD was when I was finally diagnosed with it. I was told it was a personality disorder and told to control it.. Haven't had any support! I haven't met another sufferer and obviously never heard of the disorder. I am up and down constantly and so confused. The smallest thing can change my mood and its gets so overwhelming that it turns to anger or I feel irritated. I am very lucky to have a support family and an absolutely amazing boyfriend that I live with. He supports me in every possible way but I am genuinely scared of myself and what my anger can turn too I don't want to flip out and completely lose myself in the moment. I'm constantly changing.. My hair, my style and getting new tattoos in the hope I will eventually find myself but nothing is working. After many failed relationships, friendships, let downs and failures my life is finally back on track but I still don't understand about BPD all I know is I'm unique and BPD makes me who I am. If anyone on here had BPD give me a message
