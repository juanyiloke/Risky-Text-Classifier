ÊDoes anyone start to resent their friends?Recently my friends been getting on my nerves. Almost to the point where I want to cut her off. She's so condescending and it's annoying how fake she is. I can't stand her. And I'm really angry just thinking about it. She hasn't done anything seriously wrong to me but she seriously just pisses me off. She mentions that people don't take me seriously because I wear makeup. And the other day she posted a picture that said "no makeup is the best makeup" but girl does she need some. Like it's just annoying. I'm super chill and don't care about what people wanna do with themselves. But my borderline personality takes it to the next level when people are condescending in this way. Like I don't even know why I'm friends with someone like that. Here's where I start to "split" and turn my friendship with her into resentment. Does anyone get like this? I have other great friends I get along better with but I just can't be friends with someone this weird and uptight.
