ÊThe foundations are shakingThe baby has been born-if you want to read more you can here:The Baby.Êand I find myself being aggressive and more unstable around others. I'm wondering if any of you know any methods to control anger and aggressiveness-and I'm not talking about the whole "count to ten" malarkey, I mean ways in which i can control my anger towards others by targeting the root cause. In other words, is there any advice out there for me in this state of mind-where I'm completely lost and unsure of all my relationships with other people to the extent where i will lash out just to see if someone cares... Does anyone have any advice on this? If so, please, do tell, because I am suffering a lot at the moment-and i need a way to control all this while I'm sober...
