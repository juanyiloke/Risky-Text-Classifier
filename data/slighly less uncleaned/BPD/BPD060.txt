Hi. I have bpd. Here's my story.by Mileenabug » Sun May 31, 2015 7:24 pmHi my name is Mileena I'm 19 and bipolar but was diagnosed also with bpd last week.My psyche says I have these borderline personality disorder issues because before I was adopted (my first year of life) I was neglected and surrounded by my extremely emotionally unstable birth mother. Apparently your first year of life is extremely important. I think that could be a factor. But I also think growing up with parents who fought and screamed didn't help. And apparently my therapist when I was 9 years said to my parents that my first year was going to cause damage to my mental health. Of course he didn't say that to me. He mostly was there -as a child psychologist- to be my friend and make sure I was okay. Apparently I wasn't. I was also bullied for years.... That definitely caused damage in my opinion. I'm happy to know I'm borderline.I've felt unstable all of my life. And no one knew what was wrong. I was diagnosed bipolar also but I had so many personal issues that no one could explain. I have a SEVERELY unstable identity and well everything but my identity issues drive me the most crazy. So sick of it. I've Ben homeschooled for 5 years and have continued being alone for another year. I don't have relationships and my life is very isolating. I had a boyfriend when I was 17... It lasted two weeks theN I broke up with him thinking I was gay and then wanted him back so bad. Before I started homeschooling i had a very rocky relationship with all my friends.I'm in so much pain right now. I just got out of a psychiatric hospital.i need to be nurtured and loved and the need is killing me.Anyway I'm glad to be here!
