Splitting - Which side do you believe?by lostavenue » Thu May 28, 2015 5:35 pmJust to start off, I've never been diagnosed BPD. Last night I was reading a book about Depersonalization Disorder, and it gave a description of other disorders where depersonalization is present and it mentioned BPD. Reading the description of BPD, I felt like I was reading the perfect description of myself. When I read about the concept of 'splitting', I felt my heart sink because I've never had a good way to describe that part of myself. I've been in a committed relationship the last 6 years and I go through these phases where I'm in love and want to marry my girlfriend, then sometimes I want absolutely nothing to do with her and I break up with her. Sometimes these periods last a few hours, sometimes a few days. When it does end with me breaking up with her, I always take things back once I calm down. It's so strange having these competing feelings in my brain. It's either all or nothing, there is no grey area. So I guess my question is, how do you even know what feeling are real? How do you trust yourself with making important decisions when you're dealing with this? I feel like I can't even trust my own brain sometimes. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this in a relationship, I'd love to hear from you!
