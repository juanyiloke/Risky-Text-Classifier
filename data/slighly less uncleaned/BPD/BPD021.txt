disconnected & dissociated?by climbmountains91 » Mon Jun 08, 2015 11:02 pmHi i'm kinda new to this forum. I suffer with BPD got diagnosed last year, wasn't really a surprise to be honest, was quite thankful being diagnosed with it, i found the answer to my ongoing problems. I'm now 4 months into intensive psychotherapy. Not on any meds at the moment.Lately I've been feeling disconnected and dissociated with the world, like when I'm in any given situation my minds somewhere else, it feels like i should be doing something else, my mind just feels like its at 100 miles an hour, i read this was a symptom but i don't remember having it before or ever feeling in this state. I just feel like a robot and i'm really uncomfortable with this feeling, its disrupting my therapy. Has anyone ever felt like this or does anyone know how i can ride through it or even get rid of it? It started around the time i detached from an ex who i love so much still but have been no contact for nearly three weeks now, it was an unhealthy friendship.
