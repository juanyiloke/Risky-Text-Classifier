ÊSomeone else avoidHi!ÊI'm looking for people who can relate to me.ÊI think I became an avoidant because of my borderline traits. I mean, I felt rejection, I felt that I couldn't conect with people without feeling hurt and without messing things up.ÊI think this is the reason that lead me to avoid social situations.ÊIn therapy, I came across to a sensation that I had. As I had a strenght inside me, a strenght I had to keep under control to avoid damage in my self or others.Have you got a similar story or can you feel related to something I'm saying?ÊThanks in advance!
