ÊI'm backHi guys I'm back unfortunately I took an overdose yesterday went to hospital they kept me in till the tablets went out of my system , kept violently vomiting.Seen a psych doctor , made a plan to bring my psych doc appointment forward and my psychologist forward.They changed my meds , well they upped the dosage.Still feel absolutely crap emotionally.But I'm still here and I'm glad and the only reason is I'm here for my daughter.Thanks to everyone who helped me yesterday xx
