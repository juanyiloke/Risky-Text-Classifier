Êinternal conversationsInteresting thing occurred to me today. As I was idly in the bathroom washing my hands, being tired from the day a voice came up in my mind and said "my life sucks, I hate it"The funny thing about this is, I do not actively think this nor do I feel that at all. I am doing quite well, many things are going pretty good and I'm pretty successful in a lot of my endeavors in life. My BPD traits crop up but not as violently or as often as in the past and I manage it alright. but all in all my life is one to be content and relatively happy about.ÊThat's when it occurred to me, the self talk repeatedly that we do with ourselves is much stronger than we might think. How many times during the rough parts of my life did I tell myself that my life sucked and I hated it? Apparently it had become an automatic recording that repeated itself without my cuing it up at all and became so ingrained that even in good times, like now, it comes up out of the blue without any real significance attached to it. It is strange.ÊI guess in summary my point is, be careful what you tell yourself repeatedly. Even after for the most part you may have offset your inner mind and unconscious comments to yourself the strongest ones will still remain and affect us some.Ê/end ramble
