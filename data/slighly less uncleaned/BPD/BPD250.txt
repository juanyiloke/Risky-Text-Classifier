ÊI feel like I have no personalityHiSo I've only recently discovered BPD, about a month ago, I'd no idea about it before, and I started realising that a lot of my behaviours are characteristic of BPD.For eg, I get majorly upset and angry over the smallest of things, for eg a comment that was really not meant to harm at all.Over the years I experienced dramatic and drastic change in opinions and beliefs, and this is what bothers me the most, because it makes it extremely difficult for me to plan for the future. Sometimes I feel that I don't have any personality, and that gives me the worst feeling ever, it feels like I'm lost and empty and really just floating around the world aimlessly. A lot of the times I wonder if it is all just an illusion and that everyone around me isn't real. I can't identify with myself, most people have a strong sense of self, they know what they like or dislike or what they believe in, I don't and i never have, well I do but it changes almost on a daily basis.Another thing that I find really weird about myself is that I have like these imagined up fantasies, I'm not sure what to call them. Like of me, being really beautiful or successful or happy or whatever and I'll play those over in my head at night till I fall asleep. The fantasies change real quick depending on my mood, and are really detailed, I'll make up new people, friends, their names, etc. I don't think this is related to narcissistic personality disorder for me since I have a very very low self esteem. I just wanted to know, is there some way I can change all of this, and find a strong sense of personality and beliefs and opinions because it is really starting to affect me, and I can't go to see a counselor or get help because I don't think I'll be able to fully explain what I feel, and to be honest, I am scared.
