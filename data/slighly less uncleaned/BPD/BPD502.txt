ÊI want to be a child againI want to be a child again. I want someone to hold me and tell me that everything is going to be okay. I want to cry on someones shoulder for as long as I can - and just rest in that comforting - nurturing - feeling.Anyone else want this?I don't want to get attached to another DBT therapist after what happened last time - but I know that I will. Regardless of how many boundaries I put up - I will inevitably fall in love with my therapist and re-enact my desires for a mother who is actually nurturing and loving.ÊI miss my therapist even though she abandoned me... I am torn.
