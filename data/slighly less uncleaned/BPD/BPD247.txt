 CMHT have screwed me over again -.-I went to my second scheduled appointment at CMHT a couple of weeks ago and told them, since my last one, I had increased symptoms of psychosis, had several suicide attempts and made a plan to kill my mother... Guess what? They discharged me with no treatment. Again...  I mean i said i drink at the weekends and instead of helping me with the psychosis or the plans to hurt myself/others, they sent a booklet on self help for alcoholics with their discharge letter. Im just annoyed because Im trying so hard to get help before something terrible happens and no one is doing anything... and I'm really worried  that if something doesn't happen soon then I'm gonna end up doing something ill regret...
