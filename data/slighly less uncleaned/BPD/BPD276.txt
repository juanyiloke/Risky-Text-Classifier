ÊDifference between borderline personality disorder and borderline personality complex?Hey guys,I'll keep this as brief as possible. Around 5 years ago I saw a psychiatrist about some trauma-related issues from the past and how they were affecting my relationship at the time (fyi we're still together). At the time, for reasons I can't remember, I didn't bother to look at what he'd written in my referral notes, however upon discovering them recently I noticed that he'd written "I'm of the belief that she is suffering a borderline personality complex".ÊI'm just curious to know if anybody else has come across this term before? I have a bachelor degree in psych and have never come across this. Is it just that at the time I was possibly displaying some of the traits of a person with bpd without actually qualifying for a full diagnosis? Not once was it mentioned that I had bpd, and the psychologist I was referred to treated me with cbt and exposure therapy for some of the triggers I was experiencing (more like you would for PTSD).ÊI believe I'm currently in a rather healthy place in terms of my relationships with people and consider myself a fairly consistent and placid person, albeit a little introverted.ÊI can't seem to find any literature on this topic and it's kinda doing my head in as silly as that sounds. Any thoughts/knowledge would be eternally appreciated.Thanks!
