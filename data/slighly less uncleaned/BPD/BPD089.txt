At the End of My Ropeby Danieleaf » Tue May 26, 2015 3:03 pmI've been doing a lot self work these past several months, and on the good side, I've made a lot of progress with anger and irritability issues that I've always had. I'm much more relaxed, and I don't sweat the small stuff so much anymore. However, I still have extremely pervasive issues with feeling empty, just feeling like a bottomless black hole, and I find myself simply not interested in anything at all.I volunteer occasionally on the weekends, but I can't commit to anything really because I freelance, and my work schedule is rather sporadic. I'll be very busy for a few weeks then have some downtime, and I never know how long that downtime will last. Whenever I finish a project at work and then have free time, the clock starts ticking. At first I'm happy for the break, and I go to the gym, read, etc. But day by day, I start to lose motivation, and then I start drinking more. When I have too much downtime, I find myself really struggling not to be a complete mess.Things would be great if I would simply get excited by something (like I used to), but I'm finding all too often that my general disinterest is just too pervasive. I'm definitely looking for suggestions for ways to snap out this because my usual methods aren't working anymore. The payoff isn't great enough to keep me properly motivated.
