Help recognising good/bad in relationships vs. splitting?by Zuie » Sun Jun 07, 2015 3:53 pmI don't know if it's possible for me to have a "good" partner, or how to recognise if a partner is genuinely good or bad for me (vs. believing that they're either the best or the worst), because relationships are always difficult for me with how much intense emotion is involved. I've often felt that I just can't handle relationships, and I am really working on getting better (group schema therapy and abuse counselling), but when I've been badly hurt in a relationship I don't know how to know whether to stay or go, whether I can trust my judgement or not, because I split back and forth, -- and that is really painful and confusing. Can anyone help me begin to figure this out? Thanks everyone for reading this.
