I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my headby AutumnLeaves » Mon Jun 01, 2015 5:49 amWell I officially (if you can even say that with BPD) hit rock bottom. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and yesterday he said he isn't sure he can handle the bpd anymore but today told me he definitely wants to stay with me... shortly after we went to the store and things didn't work out as I had "planned" and I ended up flipping $#%^ as usual and he literally got on a bus and left me sitting on a bench alone out front of a run down abandoned pork take out joint.He has never done such a thing before and I can't say I blame him why would anyone want to be in his position. I just feel like things are turning the feeling is all to real, this is when it all comes crashing down the break up is right around the corner. He always says he would never leave me but from my experience I've never had a guy stay. I finally quit my job that I love and told them everything, I stopped taking my meds yesterday and I have lost all hope of ever recovering. I wish I could just move back in with my mom she didn't always know what to do but she knows how to handle and calm me down the best, I can't stop crying because I am 28 years old and would do anything to just go back to mom. But I can't, she has a boyfriend who would not allow such a thing and my boyfriend truly does not want me to move out right now which totally blows my ######6 mind. What am I going to do when he doesn't want me anymore.*let me add that it's 2am here and he just walked down to the diner to get me take out because I started crying hysterically because we didn't have eggs and I'm hungry. I don't think I deserve such a giving person when I can't even be half the person he is.
