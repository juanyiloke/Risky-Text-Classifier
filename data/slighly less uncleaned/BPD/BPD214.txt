ÊIm so afraid he's going to leave me:(Hello group...I have BPD( borderline personality disorder....still trying to understand this disease...Most symptoms I suffer are fears of abandonment and my boyfriend, I've been with for over a year now can't hardly take it anymore..But yet,he continues to stay with me cause he thinks I'll somehow change and get better. I want to change more than anything, but just don't think its possible: (...our whole relationship has been pretty rocky..I have threatened to leave him on numerous occasions but I love him and know that I don't wanna leave. I promise to never hurt him and say hurtful things again,only to find myself saying them all over again the min.I get real depressed or angry at him..what do I do to keep him and stop pushing him away
