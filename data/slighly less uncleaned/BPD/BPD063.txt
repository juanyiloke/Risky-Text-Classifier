For those of you who partake......by priyamt273 » Tue May 26, 2015 1:27 pmThere are a couple of states here in the Pacific Northwest that recently legalized the recreational use of marijuana for adults. Our own little slice of Amsterdam, or something. (Minus the red-light districts). Personal beliefs regarding the legalization of such things aside, those of us with bpd who live here will be able to make a run to a dispensary of some kind (bar? cafe? hookah lounge?) and get sublimely blazed with nothing more than an ID.So, for those of you who've "never inhaled", what's been your experience with the effects of pot versus your bpd symptoms/triggers? I myself find the effects soothing, mostly because they downshift my brain's racing thoughts a notch or twelve. It wasn't always that way, of course. When I was younger I couldn't smoke pot at all because it invariably induced horrible panic attacks. That doesn't happen now, unless I inadvertently downshift a little too much.
