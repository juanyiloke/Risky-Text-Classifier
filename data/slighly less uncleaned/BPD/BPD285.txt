ÊLiving happy with BPDI have BPD. I have had it for a very long time. I have gotten help for it, group help and one on one therapy. I am so much better for it.I just want everyone who posts here to know you can live with it and still be happy. I have never quite gotten over it, it still rears its ugly head once in a while, but I am so happy with my life. I am so lucky. I am so much to be thankful for.Much love to all on the board and much good health.
