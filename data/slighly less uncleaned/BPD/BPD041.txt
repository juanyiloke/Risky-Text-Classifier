Borderline Going Haywire...by valcnu » Fri Jun 05, 2015 5:47 amI just moved to NYC last week. Don't know a single person here, haven't really met anyone either. My BPD is going insane. I have no one here. At home, I had my girlfriend and whenever I felt empty, worthless, depressed, whatever, I would see her and be fine. I can't do that anymore. I already feel like she doesn't give a $#%^ about me and doesn't care at all. I feel so ######6 isolated. I feel like everybody hates me everywhere I go. It has never been this intense for me. I feel pure hatred directed toward me from everyone. This is ######6 unbearable. I've been suicidal the past week. And I go from happy to suicidal to happy again within the same hour or even less. It's ridiculous. Now I really know what BPD is. Without any kind of support system, I am completely losing my $#%^.Having said all of that, I take comfort in knowing that I am going to a therapist on Monday. That's pretty much the only thing I take comfort in though. I have absolutely nothing else. It's always been hard for me to meet people, at least a little harder than it is for most. But over the last five years I went through some serious $#%^ where literally every ######6 friend I had completely ###$ me over. Now I don't even really have an interest in meeting and getting to know people. I'd rather be alone. Even though, at the same time, I wish I did have friends. I just do not want to meet anyone new, it takes too much ######6 effort and they might just ###$ me over too at some point. Can't trust anyone. This is a really, really bad situation I feel very, very sick right now. I have been eating very healthy, and haven't drank, smoked weed or done coke in a weed. Don't plan to do any drugs here and will only drink moderately when I do begin to drink again. But still. Not feeling all that better yet, although I know it will take time. I'm really worried about myself. Very worried at what I might do. I knew before I left this would happen. Without a support system I am a ######6 goner. I knew it and this is what happened. Before I came here I even said to myself that I might die here. I might be right. I hope not but if this $#%^ continues there is just no telling.
