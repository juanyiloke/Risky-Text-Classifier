Good Read On Concept of Trustby TinyToad » Thu Jun 11, 2015 12:14 amSoo as a person with BPD the entire concept of trust usually makes no sense to me whatsoever. I tend to trust people way too much way too soon, get burnt and flip out, or I experience extreme paranoia. I have trust issues in both directions, pretty typical for a borderline, but recently I came to the obvious but apparently elusive-for-me realization that I don't even know what trust actually is. It's just a word in my mind, and in my perception I black-and-white most situations because I really have no idea what I am doing in terms of navigating relationships of any kind. So I usually just bulldoze through it with my survival instincts on full throttle.If you can relate then consider checking out this piece I found:(And please please please feel free to add any good pieces on navigating trust that you have found, too!)I really liked this particular take on trust because it breaks it down into a process, a tool, a mechanism, something that is way easier for me to understand than most of the vague and poetic stuff I'm used to reading about "trust". I also like this explanation of trust because it is reactive, which my BPD brain is already extremely familiar with. The piece just breaks down reacting to behaviors in others instead of feelings. So not only is it a reactive mechanism, but it also puts the focus on the other person's literal actions or lack thereof. It's not some vague, metaphorical introspection exercise that makes me feel like I am walking in circles. In a nutshell this particular take on "trust" is allowing people to "teach" you about themselves.I am sure to Nons and probably even plenty of people with BPD this is all very obvious duh stuff, but for me personally it was a unique take on the concept and has given me something to think about, hopefully try out the next time I meet a potential new friend or whatever.
