 Everything all over againIt's funny how after some time feeling good and strong you forget you have bpd. Then something silly happens, a small rejection coming from someone you barely know, someone who is not very important in your life (you wanted it but it's not gonna happen) and you fall into depression. Suddenly your plans are gone and you can't remember what you were fighting for. You dont know what to do with your life. You think you will always be this miserable and nothing will ever change. You feel weak and stupid. I was so.. joyful and hopeful a few days ago. And i was proud of it. But I'm visibly sad now and I dont want anyone to notice that. I try to look happy or at least normal and now I feel exposed. I am ashamed of who I am. I'm ashamed of my condition. I will be 29 next month and I still feel, behave and live like a 16...
