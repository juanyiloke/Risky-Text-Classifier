Ê**Trigger warning** Prisoner of my own mind.So I've recently shared with some of you that my partner has aspergers. I've been with him 4 years and although I love him to bits and we've had some fantastic times together, he is very manipulative. Recently he has been seeing a psychiatrist as he lost his brother earlier this year suddenly and this has caused havvock on his mental state, he has become more depressed than usual and his temper has become explosive. He started off with just shoving and grabbing, sometimes he'd throw me out on the landing in my pj's with no shoes or phone or car keys so I had nowhere to go and no way of getting in touch with anyone. He's always felt bad about this and apologised afterwards. Recently however he has hit me, I have a black eye just now from an argument at the weekend and this is not the first time he has done this. Of course at the time I was so mad, I just wanted out, so I packed all my stuff up and went to my car at 3am with my dog and drove off. I then realised my phone was nearly dead, I had nowhere to go and no money. Then all I wanted was a hug and for everything to be ok, so I txt him n said my phone was way to pack in and he convinced me to come back to charge it, I never left again and I moved all my stuff back in.. I keep doing this. I go to leave and I go straight back. I can't leave him, I love him, but I don't trust him, but I also don't want to leave him alone... so confused!Ê
