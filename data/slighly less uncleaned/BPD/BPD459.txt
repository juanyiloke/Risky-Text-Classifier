ÊI'm borderline with supposed DID/Alter egos?Ok, so. I was recentely diagnosed with Borderline Disorder and i'm 18.I've always put a mask. The mask of the personality that i created on 2012 for overcoming my panic disorder and i was the champion in this fight on 2013 and i got cured because of that mask and others things.I don't hear voices, like, we hear voices normally, but i ''hear'', ''feel'' voices in my head sometimes, and it's the mask talking: You are me now, you're strong, you need to feel other people feel pain, you hate humans, they are horrible, they need to suffer. You need to use them like your puppets, little toys, because everyone does that and our world unfortunately is like that and people needs to do that to survive. You're sexy, you're sensual, you need to feel sex, sex is good, sex is vicious, sex pull off the thoughts, like the self harm, your art, your social mates and everything social. Kill the child that you were, kill the little child, she is crying and we need to kill her, like we does everyday. We'll torture the child and kill her.''So it's like that, i guess:Me: It's the mask, but with a few differents: I don't like exatcly to hurt people, but the mask says to me to hurt because our world is like that and humans are like that. Paranoid and overthinker and easily fall in love. Obsessed with the sensation of passion.The Mask: Arrogant, Sadistic, Cynical, a bit narcissistic, Manipulative, Funny, Friendly, Sexual friendly, Sensual, Sexy, Confident, StrongThe Child: Me until 15. Extremely shy, Talks little, Scared, Weak, Takes Abuse with submissionSo i don't know if it's fit DID or some kind of some disorder. Could someone help me, please?
