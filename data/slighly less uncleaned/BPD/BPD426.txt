 What did you used to think / still think the term "justice" means?I used to think this:I used to think that it was a bit similar to the whole concept of what goes around comes around.As in well forgive and forget competely those who rightly or wrong (as you perceived it) hurt you - intentionally or unintentionally - their opinion of you doesn't matter.Sigh.I don't believe that anymore. I have not stopped crying.I believe this:Regardless of how rightly / wrongly you perceive people to have intentionally/unintentionally hurt you, no matter what efforts you go through in order to heal the emotional damage caused by a person / event - trying to process it - trying to make sense of something that doesn't make sense in the first place - will wreck you even further emotionally.I don't think I've emotionally damaged myself as badly as I have these last 3 months by caring and believing in other people as much as I ever have in my life.It cost me absolutely everything.A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y everything that I had left inside of me to show that once, maybe just once, I had accomplished something.That I will never be allowed back.And in so helping these people it helped me, at the time, to heal.But today?It has smashed my heart to pieces.My heart can't repair the damage that this has caused to me.And yet time for these people that I helped - they simply moves on as if I never existed in the first place?I did not know that was even possible?My brain simply can not make sense of this?How?I'm shattered.I can't even trust my own throughts anymore.I don't know how I became such a mess so quickly.
