ÊNew Group of Potential FriendsSo, I've been involved with a few new groups I got in contact with through meetup.com.ÊAfter a few weird run-ins with the leader of one of the groups.. (she vilified me and misrepresented what I was saying on the group's private facebook page- then erased my responses as she is the admin of the page), I let them know I wouldn't be coming back. Then, I got a message from another member saying that this leader had run off quite a few with her combative personality, and that she's in treatment for bipolar disorder.. but I should keep that to myself. Then, I got invited to a new group that is similar in nature to the first, by some other former members...2 of the members of the new group have let me know that their loyalties lie with the leader of the other group... Anyway, there are times I feel I've been misunderstood and that they misinterpret what I'm saying in negative ways... I'm having a hard time deciding if it's worth my while to keep attending, so that hopefully they will see what kind of person I really am (I like to think I've basically a good person at heart), or if I should just give up and go somewhere else, because I feel defensive when I'm around some of them, without being able to put my finger on exactly why. It's like some have made judgements about me, and react to me in ways that just aren't based in reality. But, others in the group have been friendly and non-judgemental.
