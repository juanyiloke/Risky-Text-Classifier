I Have Borderline Personality DisorderApparently so. It was only in recent months I was told that I have BPD. I was like "Oh, so that's what all that nonsense in my head must be"I honestly thought I was losing it, or going nuts. I go to extremes and I push people away. To the extent that I have never has one consistent friendship or relationship in my entire life. That makes me very sad, and very angry at myself.I have started DBT recently, which stands for Dialectical behavior therapy. It consists of going to individual therapy one day a week, and group therapy on a different day. I have to juggle all that and work too, and other commitments. It's motherf***ing hard, I hate it, and I don't believe it in any way. At the same time if I don't do it i'll probably end up killing myself anyhow.ÊI feel like that one guy at the circus who you see spinning the plates. Trying so hard to keep them all upright and in order. As soon as he's fixed one, another is already wobbling. Except that's my whole life and I can never stop that impossible balancing act. Something is always going to come crashing down on me.
