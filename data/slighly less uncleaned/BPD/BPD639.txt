I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI only found out that I had this diagnosis when I requested access to my medical notes. I had been diagnose with BPD for a long time and no one told me. I was initially diagnosed with depression and my treatment team and hospital staff were very kind then.ÊOnce I was diagnosed with BPD people seemed to think that I would be manipulative and attention seeking so they started to give me poor treatment. There was one time when I went to A&E because I was suicidal and the psych team refused to assess me and told me to go home and stop wasting their time. I've also been told that i'm playing the system when I was advised to go to A&E twice in one day. BPD is such a stigmatised illness.
