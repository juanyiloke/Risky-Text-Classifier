ÊUnbearableI am so unbelievably, unbearably, all-consumably lonely these days that I'm afraid it's going to swallow me up. It doesn't matter if I do have friends in my life, I don't feel like they really validate or are super concerned about me as a person, just me as a sometimes companion in hanging out. I feel invisible to others unless I'm doing something for them. I want to create a scene so that people will see and hear me, but would that really do anything besides make people think I'm a crazy person? No.ÊI don't think most people are aware of what it has taken me, all my life, since I was a child, to just survive. I don't think people are aware of how much I am hurting on a daily basis--probably because I have this wry, sarcastic sense of humor (which I've heard is a healthy coping mechanism) that they want more of. And when I tell them, honestly, that I'm struggling they just think that I'm having your average case of the blah's and tell me something trite and leave it at that.ÊI know who I am, I know what my life is. I know that I will always struggle with relationships and I know that I will never fully fit in with people the way that I want simply because of what I've been through; I don't identify with most people. I know that, in some ways, that makes me a unique and actually quite interesting person. But that doesn't make it hurt any less.
