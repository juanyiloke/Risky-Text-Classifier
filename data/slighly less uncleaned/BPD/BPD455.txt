ÊBuzz buzz.I feel quite buzzy and twitchy. Odd. I think my mood may be on the way up. Like, up up. I hope so but I'm sure I shouldn't.ÊI SHOULD relax and meditate and be sensible and maybe do do something so I can't access money etc.ÊBut I WANT caffeine and staying up late and walking late at night and all sorts of... pleasurable... activities.ÊOn the other hand, it's unusual for me to notice this at an early stage and I know I should choose to do what I can to be sensible and stay balanced. But that is not what I want. I have been low for so long and I WANT a 'high'.ÊSomeone talk some sense into me?
