Do you tell people about your BPD?by laurapalmer » Thu Jun 11, 2015 12:46 pmHi, first post hereI got diagnosed with BPD this year and since then I've been telling a lot of IRL people (friends, acquaintances, strangers in bars...) about my BPD. I just can't control the urge of telling them (especially when I am drunk - which is a bit too often lately), and it makes me feel shame and guilt afterwards... But still, I always seem to end up wanting to discuss mental illness...People are generally accepting and supportive, but some are irritated and annoyed (including a very close friend who say it is triggering). I also had a fair share of strangers opening up about their own mental illness diagnosis.Not sure if I do this because I'm trying to deal with what I am going through, or to ruin my social life, or to get attention... but I hate that I do it.Do you tell about your BPD or do you keep it secret?Why? How?
