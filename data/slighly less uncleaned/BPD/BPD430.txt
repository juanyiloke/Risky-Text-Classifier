Êspinning on the insideMy boyfriend works late he always has since I met him but almost every night I get so sick with anxiety that he isn't at work or he is lying to me about something going on there. We have a tracker app so I can see he is there and he checked in on it an hour ago.ÊIt just truly amazes me that I have all the proof I need that he is there and worse case I can always go down there , he told me before I can go to his work anytime I want if I'm feeling unsure he works in the music industry so a girlfriend showing up isn't out of the ordinary at all. Which is probably why I never go because who would say that if they were being sneaky!?ÊI am always being pulled in two different directions I know what is true on the one side then the other side is in total confusion and panic.. anyone else feel like their 2 people in one?
