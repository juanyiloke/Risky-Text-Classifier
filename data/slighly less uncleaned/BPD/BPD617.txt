I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI am (almost can't believe it) peaceful since yesterday night and today.I am usually a lot of emotions,but never peaceful,never.The instances where I have been peaceful,I can probably count them on my fingers.Usually peace in me ,is replaced by emptiness,hollowness,and a yearning for something i don't understand,like I drug I am addicted to,but I do not know what it is.And I have been having a major identity crisis or dissociation for three days,where I have no clue who I am anymore.So today I was not expecting peace.Something is wrong.I am probably going insane,haha.I am so happy I am peaceful,I am so worried any second now,it will go away.Peace is such a beautiful feeling.I love peace.I cherish peace.Peace is awesome.
