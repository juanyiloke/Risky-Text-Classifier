 bpd & pmddThis honestly feels like a curse although I guess that's my personalization issue.15 Common Cognitive Distortions | Psych CentralI am just losing it I can't take it every month sometimes for 2 weeks before I get my period I am an emotion tornado that just seriously sucks to be pissed off for 14 days in a row my chest actually hurts from the anger and sadness I feel. I have now ruined yet another door in my home, I pushed my boyfriend cuz I was certain he was cheating on me and punched and hit objects to the point of bruising my arms and hands. I feel like I am going to explode  I have a stash of Xanax I strictly use for the pmdd symptoms because I have no control whatsoever but it's not really good to use with divalproex and makes me so sleepy I can't do a thing but nap so I caved the last 2 days of pmdding and took one each day it's just really saddening to me that I can't make myself feel good I have to use a drug to stay calm. And I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend anymore I just feel like a mess and I have therapy tomorrow which I'm sure we'll bring up me pushing my boyfriend so gotta prepare for the guilt and embarrassment of that incident. I'm just so disappointed in myself.
