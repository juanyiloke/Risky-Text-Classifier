ÊBursts of Crying for Basically no Reason?Hello.I was just wondering if this happens to anyone else?ÊSomething so insignificant will happen, then I will burst out into tears. Like full on bawling my head off.ÊExamples: I dropped a beverage at a family gathering. Would have been so easy to clean up as it was a frozen smoothie. I lost my mind. It was quite embarassing.ÊAnother example: my husband and I were cleaning out the trailer. He found a tick (for those of you that don't know a tick is a small spider looking animal that will dig into your skin, disgusting) on my sweater. Usually that would be no biggie at all. I freaked out and lost my mind again.ÊI've never been like this before. Do you think it might be the meds? I don't know Help!
