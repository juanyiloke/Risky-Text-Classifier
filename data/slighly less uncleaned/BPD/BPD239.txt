ÊHi new to this site and new to BPDHelloMy name is Rob and I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder on Sunday after a crisis. So I'm new to everything so ill apologize now for asking silly things. I've joined this forum to meet some new people who understand where I'm coming from and maybe even steal some techniques for coping when things get tough.ÊI was directed here from the introductions page. That's enough of my rambling I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi so hi again Its nice to meet you all.
