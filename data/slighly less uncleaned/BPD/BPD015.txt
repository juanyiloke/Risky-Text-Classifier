So I've just been to the funeralby NatashaGabber » Fri Jun 12, 2015 4:51 pmof the auntie whose husband abused me as a child. I apologise now fore the typin but i am under the influence of alcohol after attending the wake.The uncle who abused me is the husband of my mums identical twin sister.I managed to hold it all together until at the wake my cousin, the step daughter of the uncle, asked me how counseliing was going.i replies it's going well but i need to get it off my chest to my other cousin, (re: the daughter of the uncle who it's always been a secret to, and who has a daughter i've always been concerned about protecting (despite the uncle living in australia and only visiting on occasions )anway, my mum pipes up, it's my issue and need to put it to bed, until my cousin, the step daughter, started saying she knows its hard foir me but to rest assured the daughter of my cousin will always be protected from harm. I cannot believe this and feel it's my duty to inform the other cousin of his wrong doing believeing that the only real protection comes from her mum, likewise i felt the same about my parents, even though this didn't happen in realtiy (i always understood that they were aware my uncle had issues with children , at some point during my abuse, but still left me alone with him.anyway, i got tearful, adamant that i chould tell my cousin (not at her mums funeral but somepoint in the future as all my counselling had suggested i do to help me get over it) i was met with denail and assurances, but this didn't meet my emotional needs. suffice to say, i was escorted from the funeral wake by my parents who decided it better i went home, even though i didn'y bring the subject up, but because i was emotional, and on the journey home pretty much put the balme on me for ruining everything and failed to acknowledge i have some justification for my feelings.can anyone give me another perspective on this or give me some advuce that helps me make sense of what happened please? sorry for the typin i'm very tearful x
