I Have Borderline Personality DisorderIt's not in my plans to "have" this condition forever. I will keep working on myself but today I'm just wondering how many more friendships will I lose and how many more chaotic relationships until I conquer this ? I sort of just lost someone very important today, the girl I am in love with, but we were just friends. She bursted out at me telling me she was exhausted of my negative, destructive, passive aggressive attitude, and my sarcasm. I don't blame her. We were really close friends. Probably the closest friend I've ever had. It's overwhelming. I never meant to push her away. I did it unconsciously. I would always be apologizing. I am hurt. I somehow feel guilty and guilt shouldn't really be there because it will only make things worse. I have a dbt workbook because I just can't find any dialectical behavior therapy groups and it saddens me deeply that I have to deal with this on my own. My parents' behavior doesn't really help. I hold resentment against them and I'm trying to let go but the memories of them always fighting and practicing destructive behavior in front of my eyes haunts me.I want to know there's hope and someone has overcome this. I just need some words of hope and light.
