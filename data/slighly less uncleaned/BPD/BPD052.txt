BPD is ruining my relationship?by blanc123 » Wed Jun 03, 2015 10:48 amFirst off, I'm sorry if there's already a thread similar to this. I'm just so desperate for answers right now and I have nowhere else to turn to.Anyway, I've been starting a bunch of arguments with my boyfriend and all of them are caused by my bpd. When I say a bunch, I mean soo much that I'm actually surprised he hasn't left me yet. It would be so often as once per week or other week. I would just have constant delusions that he's losing interest in me or I'm not getting enough attention when in reality, he gives me the most attention out of everyone in his life. I feel bad because he doesn't even know what to do or say to me anymore and he just feels like he's repeating himself and I would just get mad at him because I'd have the false feeling that he's just isn't being supportive. I'm so grateful that he decided to be patient with me and stick with me for this long. But the arguments are getting worse. In our recent argument, I yelled at him for the first time. This needs to stop.Does anyone have any tips or advice for being in a relationship while having bpd? And also, any tips for alleviating the symptoms or dealing with the disorder? I don't have the money to go to a therapist and I don't want to take any meds, if that's even an option. Any help is appreciated!
