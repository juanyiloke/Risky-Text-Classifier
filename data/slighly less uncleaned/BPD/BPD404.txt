Êthe terrible, horrible, no good, very bad dayThat describes today. My son was acting up most of the day but I don't think he was the trigger. I had a massive anxiety attack while grocery shopping, it just kept getting worse. We had to leave with only half our shopping done. I must have looked really pale as one of the cashiers stopped me to ask if I needed any help. My husband was pissed off and that brought out the BPD big time. When we got home I went up to our room and cried myself to sleep. He finally came in 2 hours later and said he loved me, but here it is 6 hours later and I feel just as anxious. I took an ativan at the grocery store but it never really helped.
