ÊNew diagnosis, fits, but it seems like an endingHi all,I've been bouncing around the mental health system for the past year, now they say I have BPD. It fits, explains a few things, but really it just feels like I am being told that I am never going to have the life I wanted.ÊI've read a couple of books, they seem mostly aimed at helping friends and family "deal with" their BPD loved ones. I don't want to have to be dealt with. I want to be ok on my own and never have to explain to a partner that they have picked a squeaky wheel. I always knew something was wrong with me, so kids were already out of the question, but now I can't even make new friends or date new people. Now I know that I am always going to be an emotional mess.To add further insult to injury, everyone keeps harping on at me about making a decision to get better. I make that decision ALL THE TIME. It's just that then I make another decision 5 minutes later. I guess that is related to impulse control, but I can't get treatment until I convince some idiot shrink that I have "made the decision". Which seems like a bit of a paradox since I don't know how to.I'm posting here as I hope that someone has a better story to share, because right now everything is looking bleak.Thanks.
