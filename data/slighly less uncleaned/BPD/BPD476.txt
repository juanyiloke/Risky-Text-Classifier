Êextreme paranoia in relationshipI'm in a long term relationship and recently I found out my partner has been frequently talking to his ex, and never mentioned it to me. the conversations aren't anything inappropriate at all, they're just catching up and being polite but ever since I found out I've been overwhelmingly paranoid.ÊI have this terrible feeling that he's cheating, that he doesn't love me, that's he's going to leave. I know that he isn't, that there's nothing going on, but I don't know at the same time. Does that make sense?Does anyone have any tips for dealing with these periods of paranoia?
