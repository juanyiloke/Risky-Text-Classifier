ÊDiagnosisWas easy to get an accurate diagnosis for you? I was reading that it isn't sometimes easy bc some patients are not awared of all the symptons and they obviously don't give the doctor the information and on the other hand, many people display borderlines symptoms but in a slight level and they may be diagnosed with the disorder when they haven't it. I also read that many borderline patients are misdiagnosed with other personality disorders before getting the right diagnosis.ÊI was diagnosed with AvPD eight years ago. But, I think it was a misdiagnosis. It was left that part of information that I wasn't awared of bc I didn't contact with people, I avoid them and it is now that I'm more in contact with them that I realiced of my emotional inestability, idealization and devaluation people easily, emotional attachment...How was your story about the diagnosis, if you don't mind share?
