Êseeking answersI know I have BPD. Self diagnosed. Relationships with people are so hard for me. People don't like me. I try to be nice but often am a *****. My moods change at a drop of a hat from happy to pissed and I take it out on my husband by convincing him he is the problem when really he is a super great and awesome man. I have such a hard time with relationships and have written so many people off in my life because they piss me off or I don't like the way they act, talk, or look at me. I over analyse everything and always think people are talking bad behind my back. Often they are. I don't know why I am like this except genetics I'm sure but I want to change it. I want to have healthy relationships with peopleI have great relationships with my kids but they are little. I'm scared they are going to grow up and see who I really am and not want anything to do with me like most people I meet. Help!
