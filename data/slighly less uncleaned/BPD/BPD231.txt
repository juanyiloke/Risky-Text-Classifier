ÊI feel so unsafeI'm feeling so suicidal and I have been trying to use my DBT skills to help, but nothing is working it just feels I'm delaying the inevitable.ÊI am so tearful and I'm trying not to cry as I don't want my hubby and daughter to know I'm that miserable. I don't want to drag them down. I don't want to feel a burden to them.ÊI am reluctant to call the crisis line again they said I could as much as I need to. I just think no one can help me like ive reached the end of a long road and it's the end of me. I've tried various therapies and groups and been in the mental health system for 18 years and I'm through with it.
