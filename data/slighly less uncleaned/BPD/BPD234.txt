 RelationshipHere goes this is the single biggest disregulating thing in my life at the moment.I'm in a relationship for the last 2 years I cannot commit to the girl as I'm still in love with my ex (she's the mother of my child) I only see my current gf once a week to which we prob end up drinking alcohol and fighting , the reason I fight is because I wanna break up wih here (and I dont) it's complicate! I don't have the strenght to break up with her sober incase I hurt her , as Iv hurt her so much in the past. My biggest fear is that sum1 else will have sex with her , she is so beautiful and any time wer out I see atleast 5 or 6 guys try it on with her , and I'm afraid wen she's out if I break up with her that this will happen and she will go home and sleep with them , it makes me so sick to my stomach , I'm not sure I'm in love with her.I still love the mother of my child she was sooooo good to me way better then my current gf who isn't that good to me , I broke up with my ex because she had a headache one day and I hated her for that (black and white thinking) this current gf is very controlling very paranoid and jealous as I am it's not a healthy relationship I need to end it but don't have the heart to do it.I really wanna live happily with my ex gf and my daughter as a family , I regret breaking up with her so much as my mental health spiralled down hill completely after it , God I regret it soooooo much  Don't know if thers any questions in ther it's more of a ramble , if any1 has anything to say please do I would love to hear it , or any questions please ask. Thanks guys and gals.
