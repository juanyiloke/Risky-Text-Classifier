 Update & medication question.Sorry for another post! I posted before about having an assessment today for therapy. It went well, the guy was nice and we decided that CBT would be the most suitable thing for me, so I've been put on the waiting list. The bad news is that the waiting list is 3-6 months long. Which wouldn't usually be a problem, but I've just now been offered a job in another area, and if all goes well I'll be moving in about 6 weeks. I'm going to keep my name on the waiting list for now, just in case anything goes wrong with the job, but in all likelihood, I will be leaving before having the opportunity to start therapy. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to access some form of help where I'm moving to, so that's not the end of the world. I'm looking forward to moving and to the new job, but I'm also quite nervous about it (which is normal, I know!) I've been really low lately, and I feel like it's important that I'm doing as well as possible by the time I start work. I'm considering asking my GP about medication, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.I've found antidepressants really helpful in the past, but when I tried to go back on them recently (last year) it wasn't a good experience - my mood was good, but I was too restless to sleep, or sit still, or anything really. I switched to a more sedating one, and it was pretty much the worst experience of my life. I was tired but restless and miserable and my skin was crawling and I was having panic attacks (I never do) and I was so angry I wanted to hurt people or myself (I have never felt like that before) and I absolutely can't go through that again. I know probably speaking to my doctor about it is best, and I probably will but just wondered if anyone had any advice. Or if you know whether, having had a bad experience last time, it would be likely to be the same again?Thanks
