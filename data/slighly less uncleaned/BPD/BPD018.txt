BPD with co-occurring anxiety disorderby catlady1786 » Mon Jun 08, 2015 3:41 pmI am aware that medication will not "cure" BPD, but what do you do about the overwhelming anxiety that comes with it? I have been struggling with anxiety for too long and I have tried everything (yoga, natural remedies, homeopathy, acupuncture) and nothing has seemed to work. I don't know how I am supposed to be able to do the DBT and learn the techniques when I am so anxious that I can barely concentrate for longer than 5 minutes? Is anyone else having this issue?Can anyone offer any suggestions? I am seriously considering going on meds for the first time in my life. I am a high functioning person, so I can't go on like this much longer. Thanks!
