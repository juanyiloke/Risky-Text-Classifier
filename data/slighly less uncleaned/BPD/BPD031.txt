Ambivalence is no fun! *possible tw*byÊNimplyDinplyÊÈ Wed Apr 08, 2015 1:54 pmHi all, this is weird so just bear with me.Splitting as a defense mechanism goes like this, from what I understand: ambivalent feelings ---> anxiety over two co-existing feelings towards object ----> the subject "splits off" either the good or the bad so that the object becomes either "all good" or "all bad".Now this is strange, but I seem to be stuck on the "anxiety" part. I cannot seem to tolerate the ambivalence as it creates anxiety within me BUT I'm not able to "split off" the good or the bad either.In this case, I'm referring to my mother, husband and daughter.I have ambivalent feelings toward all three. My mother, well, she's paranoid and borderline herself, so there's always some tension there. My husband, won't go too much into that but I harbor both feelings of intense love and hatred toward him at the same time for the past few months. And my daughter, I do love her and care about her but there are some negative feelings there as well, not necessarily about her but about my capacity to take care of her and love her and so on.All of this has resulted in a tremendous amount of inner discord and anxiety within me.Either I have to split or I have to accept the anxiety that these feelings create through whatever means.Going to pre-DBT this Friday so I hope DBT can help.Anyone have any ideas?Ê
