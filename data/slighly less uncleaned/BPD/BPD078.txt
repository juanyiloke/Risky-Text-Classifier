what's good about you?by NimplyDinply » Thu May 21, 2015 1:11 pmOkay so I was laying in bed and then memories from my childhood came forth. I remember how kind and sharing I was, never greedy, always willing to help everyone, including animals. Then I remembered that I do the same as an adult and I sat there and thought, "you know, I am a good person, why do I always feel I am bad??"I realize this may be bragging but I am a good person and no one ius going to tell me otherwise ever again.Unfortunately, I am aware that this shift in self perception and the resulting grandiosity won't last. Soooo today I am going to tell everyone I don't like, that treats me as a doormat, to FCK off. Then wait for my all bad perception to reel itsvway back in.Now, what's great about YOU? Everyone has something good about them! Can't think of anything and you're a forum regular? I will tell you something good that is 100% honest, I swear.I love you all, my fellow BPs.
