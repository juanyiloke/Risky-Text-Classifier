Having a really bad cutting/anorexia relapseby venomxo » Tue Jun 02, 2015 7:02 pmIm not sure what to do at this point. I think i might be bipolar in addition to borderline because i was feeling good for a bit then i just dropped. I've started thinking im fat again and itsbecoming legit difficult to realize im not. I wanted to lose 5 lbs and instead i lost 10. My size 2s bag on me now and my size 0s arent even form fitting. You can see bones all up my back and inbetween my boobs atm.The other night i was having a very restless sleep and woke up crying with very dark thoughts that just flooded my brain out of nowhere. I felt worthless and gross and wanted to die and was sorely tempted to cut but forced myself not to because i knew they would end up deep gashes if i did and scars would just mske every thing worse atm.I just feel really lonely and like i don't want to keep doing this. Im not sure if i have the energy to deal with this this time. The only thing that excites me right now is thinking about jumping off a bridge
