ÊExaggerated StartleThe C-PTSD part of me has ramped up again. And my Pdoc upped my Abilify in an effort to calm that down.ÊMy Mom came back home the end of April after a 4-month hospital and skilled rehab stay. She went back into the hospital this past weekend and I brought her back home early this morning.Last week, my Dad called me to tell me he has a new diagnosis of malignant neck cancer of unknown origin.ÊLast week, I also had a physical that SSDI set up for my SSDI application.ÊAnd if that weren't enough, I've taken on a contracting project of writing a business plan for a local business looking to expand and seeking funding.ÊI know I'm whining. Just could use a few cyber hugs. Thanks!
