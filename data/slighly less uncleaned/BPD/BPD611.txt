I Have Borderline Personality DisorderBPD. A disorder that is relatively common, but can ruin a life in a matter of months. My life was ruined, but a lot of people don't understand how. I have no friends, and have been in multiple abusive situations. Verbal and sexual. Do you know whats it's like to have to explain to people when they ask about the scar on my leg. The scar is three inches long, and about a half inch wide. I was stabbed with a switchblade by a boy who went to school with me. Because of my BPD, I basically will do anything to make friends or make relationships. People took full advantage of it. I was everyone's doormat. If I liked a guy, they would abuse me and get me to do things for them, but my BPD told me that it was the only way they would like me, and I was so desperate to have friends. Years of abuse crushed my self confidence and my mind. After being put in a mental hospital for 11 days after my 4th suicide attempt, I knew that I had to do something if I ever wanted to get better. I was put on a variety of 7 different medications (yes I know thats a lot) to help with my BPD, and my other mental problems. After I was discharged, I began DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy).The therapy has been helping me greatly, and I strongly recommend it to anyone that suffers from BPD. I am still currently doing DBT, and will be doing it for the next year. I have some hope now for my future, and I am living proof that it does get better.
