ÊQuality BPD Treatment with Medicare thru Disability??Hello, I couldn't find a thread where this issue was directly addressed. After what I think was an exhaustive attempt to find good comprehensive treatment for BPD with having Medicare A/B and some savings from being employed in the past, I am becoming pretty hopeless.ÊSo far, my attempts have been correspondence with NAMI, MHA, TARA4BPD (NYC), Medicare, SAMHSA, Behavioral Tech-listed clinicians in C.A. , UCLA Initiative for BPD/UCLA Harbor, Clear View Treatment Center, BPDresourcecenter.org email, and my own psychiatrist. Amazingly, every referral route that I've tried from corresponding to these organizations lead to non-working numbers/emails or self-pay costs that are too expensive.ÊI am very thankful that I have gov't assistance to help me get better; but unfortunately, I am getting progressively worse.ÊI have been in psychiatric and psycho-therapeutic care for 21 years and I have been wrongly diagnosed and put on meds that made me sick. If anyone knows of a good therapist and psychiatrist...or even an intensive out patient/PHP....that specializes in BPD within the Southern California area where they will work with me on the cost...PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!There is McLean Hospital, but it will require me to find housing and living costs that I might not be able to afford.ÊFYI- I have had disability since 2007 after making two serious attempts at suicide and having psychiatric history that dates back to my teenage years.Thanks for reading..
