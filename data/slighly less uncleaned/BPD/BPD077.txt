How would you react to flowers from an ex?by BassOutcast » Mon May 25, 2015 9:59 amHey, this question goes to all the wonderful girls here with BPD.Imagine a scenario - you break up with your ex, you shut off all contact and avoid his attempts to get back together and work things out. Months go by and you go on with your life, feeling like your ex forgot you and moved on, and then suddenly you open your door on your birthday and you see your favorite flowers, a small present and a card wishing you happy birthday from that same ex.Now, assuming neither of you had a r/s since - how would you feel? triggered? upset? sad? I just want someone to shine a light on this scenario for me.
