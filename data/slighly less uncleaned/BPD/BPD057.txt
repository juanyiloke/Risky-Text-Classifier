Romantic Relationships Especially Bad By Farby TinyToad » Mon Jun 01, 2015 8:49 pmI feel like I do just fine with friendships even really close ones. I usually do fine with coworkers and only have issues with superiors in the work place if they do not seem to like me at all. If they are more aloof or seem to like me then I have no problems. Even with bosses who seem to not like me I still do relatively well as long as I can mostly avoid them. With family I tend to do okay most of the time because deep down I have a very strong love for them which makes me hesitate even when I am extremely furious. The worst that has ever happened has been some big blow out fights that involved a lot of yelling but nothing super nasty and no physical aggression. I feel like my love for them gives me just enough pause to prevent it because it creates a very strong internal conflict so I am more likely to flee if I feel the situation rapidly escalating because deep down I do not want to ever hurt them.But with romantic relationships everything always goes straight to hell. Romantic relationships seem to be my biggest trigger by far when it comes to my BPD traits flaring up and through the bloody roof. I feel like whenever I feel like I am falling in love romantically I just start to go bat---- crazy. I either become extremely depressed and self destructive or I become diabolical like some crazed vigilante seeking some ultimate vengeance.I have never experienced this with friends and such before though. My friends tend to stay completely "white" and I tend to be extremely loyal and protective. But as soon as a relationship starts to turn romantic or sexual I completely lose my ----.Anyone else have it like this, any theories as to why there is such a huge difference?
