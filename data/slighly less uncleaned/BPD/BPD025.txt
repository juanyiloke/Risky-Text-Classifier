When he paints you black :(by Aprilxoxoxox » Mon Jun 08, 2015 2:23 pmMy (ex) best friend has spit me black for the last two weeks and it has destroyed me.  I don't know what to do. Iv tried to tell him I love him and il never leave but it didn't work. But this week he's started saying very dangerous things like I stalk him I harass him I'm scary I'm ######6 with his head. None of which is true. He's the one calling me constant before this fall out. I only shower him at times of need with love to reassure him I'm always there for him and won't leave as he has no one else. Is it normal for a borderline to say such severe and final things? It's broken my heart I feel he thinks this of me when all I wanted was to be someone constant in his life.
