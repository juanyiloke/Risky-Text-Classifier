Attachment issuesby floralgiraffes » Sun May 31, 2015 1:21 pmI've always had issues when it comes to finding myself becoming obsessive and attached to older women. It's not a romantic attraction, it is merely craving their 'motherly love.' I can maintain perfectly healthy relationships with everyone else, except these people.I crave affection from them, and if I don't get it I get extremely angry with them, and I don't understand why I'm not getting this attention I so desire. This often causes me to act impulsively, which leads me to either self harm, drink excessively or binge eat. A massive part of me does this to feel better, obviously, but another part of me thinks 'I hope they realise what they're doing to me, they deserve to feel bad.'I find myself frantically contacting people who I feel attached to, and when I'm talking to them, I don't want them to leave. I get extremely anxious when, for example, they say they're going out so they can't talk right now, or they're going to sleep.I love them , but I hate them. I love this feeling, but I hate it.It completely affects my mood, and general wellbeing as it has an impact on everything I do in my life as I can't stop thinking about how much I crave attention from motherly figures.I was just wondering if anybody can relate to this? And any suggestions on how to cope?Thanks.
