 HeyHiI haven't needed to be here for quite a while but things seem to be changing...A couple of years ago I found something called Kratom that was legal in my country and heard how it could relieve anxiety and depression. I was willing to try anything so this crushed leaf seemed harmless. I cannot put into words how this wonderful leaf turned my life around. I went from an anxious, crazy depressed person, into a productive, happy person who loved every minute of every day. Things were going that well I was promoted to manager within an agency I work. My life became everything I ever wanted it to be and more. The last couple of weeks I have noticed something different...old ways are creeping back in and I am becoming once again volatile. To top it off the UK are adopting a blanket ban of untested substances such as the one I take. It is really targeting 'Legal Highs' and because of a lack of understanding, Kratom comes under that blanket.So there it is, it seems my tolerance has grown and besides that it will be banned in a matter of months....if it wasn't to be banned I would still need to give it a break to sort my tolerance but that isn't an option any more as the leaf will no longer be an option.I am currently in manager training and gradually the owner of the agency is passing more work over to me. My fear is without the Kratom I won't be able to do this. My fear is my whole perfect world will fall apart and become the volatile, anxious, depressive I once was. Right now I am fricking scared of what the next few months will bring
