What is a nervous breakdown?by kah80 » Tue May 26, 2015 7:53 pmSomeone mentioned at the weekend that their boss had one a few years ago, and it got me wondering if I've had one. I know you're probably all thinking that I seem to be constantly trying to make it sound like I have every problem under the sun! And you could be right.But I'm just curious. Many years ago I had a job where I fell for a colleague. She reported me for sexual harrassment and I got a disciplinary. I cut myself all the time. It got worse and worse in this job. I met a group of people who I hung out with and we used to get drunk all the time.I got more and more depressed in this job and it all came to a head one day when the phone rang, I threw it across the room and burst into tears. The next day at work we had a meeting and I cried throughout it. I then went to the doctor and ended up being signed off with depression for 6 weeks.Does this sound anything like a nervous breakdown? It's fine if the answer is no! Its just something I wondered about.
