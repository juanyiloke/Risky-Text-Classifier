ÊSelf DestructionHi GuysI'm diagnosed BPD and have received treatment to help me manage the everyday symptoms. I am currently prescribed 150mg Quetipine per night.The reason for the post is that although I get by most days, i have moments where I cannot control my impulses and take cocaine. I'm certainly not addicted to cocaine but even taking it every couple of months leaves me racked with guilt. Not sure what to do as i can't use a support group due to my occupation as a student mental health nurse.Any ideas would be appreciated and I hope you don't judge me too harshlyCheers
