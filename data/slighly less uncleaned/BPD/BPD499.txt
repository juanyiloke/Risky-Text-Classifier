ÊIs this a Borderline thing?When I am, for lack of a better word, obsessed with someone and they have touched some object I want that object. 2 examples...ÊA while back, my therapist had a small piece of paper in his pocket and pulled it out and remarked, "What is this from?" I innocently asked to see it at which point together we decided that it was trash from the back of a sticker. In his mind, it was over. Not in mine. I now had something of his and wanted to keep it. I told him what was going on in my head and gave it back. This was before my divorce, before my relapse, when I was only seeing him every 3 months. I knew it was unhealthy so I "nipped it in the bud."ÊSecond example happened tonight. There's a man who I see 3 days a week in the NA meetings. I'm drawn to him. He isn't really good looking, just normal. He is soft spoken, maybe 60 years old, 30 years clean, and married. I always enjoy being near him and lately we've started talking. Enough background. At the meeting tonight I took my phone, keys, and box cutter (for work) out of my pocket and placed them on the table. When he came in I got up for coffee and hoped that he would sit near me. He did and when I got back to my seat he had my knife and was checking it out. It's a cool box cutter. Anyway, I was so excited that he was playing with it. He was touching my stuff. So now, of course, in my head, the box cutter is more special. Just like the rock I showed my therapist a few weeks ago that he touched.ÊSorry for being so long winded. Anyone else do this sort of thing? I have crap I've saved from 25 years ago. I've been this "crazy" for a long time.
