  Getting thereI can say I am finally getting there. Since Xmas eve, confirmed Xmas day I have been really getting better in myself. I have had a few ups and downs but I can say I am getting better.I am married to the man  I love so much and we have a little one on the way and life couldn't be more perfect  right now.I just wish that everyone I talk to her and another place would have more luck in having a perfect life too.I know I am not around much but I always  think of this place and how much support I have gotten from everyone here and wish I could do the same for you all.Take care  everyone, I still be around don't worry, weather it be weeks at a time I still be lurking.
