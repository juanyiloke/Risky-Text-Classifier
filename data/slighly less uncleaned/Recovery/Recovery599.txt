  This might be obvious, but it wasn't to meI am supposedly bi-polar and rapid cycling. I've fought this shit for ~30 yrs. I'm in a very odd place right now. I'm calm, upbeat w/o being manic, and feel as close to what I think 'normal' people must feel like as I ever have.I think I have spent 3 decades being, simply, exhausted. I think the bipolar was just me busting my butt as hard as I thought I should for as long  as I could, and worrying about what I hadn't got done, and collapsing when I couldn't maintain it. Somehow I've just... stopped. I sleep, take my time with things and do them how I'd like, do what I want, and if you think I could be doing more... you're right, but I don't want to and I don't have to. And yes, I'm taking the day off tomorrow...I want to take a walk and then a nap. My business is crazy slow right now; we're barely making payroll if that. I don't care . It'll pick up or it won't, and if I have to lay someone off that sucks but it's just the way it is. My remodel of my apt is going on 1 1/2 years now. I don't care. The bathroom is functional if not finished, and turning out beautifully. I'll finish as material arrives. I work a little on the kitchen in the evenings, some nights I don't want to and I don't. Cabinet fronts came today, half of them are wrong. I don't care; made the call and it'll get put right. Some things are disappointing. I say 'That's too bad,' and move on. I ran into my ex yesterday, and was happily surprised tofind  her more nervous about it than me, and to find that that I was glad she was ex, and that I wasn't mad at her, etc.'Serene' is the best  word I can find to describe it. I'm a beautiful  yacht sailing, gracefully, through all waters. I'm not in a race. I'm enjoying this day.
