A new beginningAbout a year ago I was on here contemplating ending my life to the point of ending up in hospital. I honestly thought there was no escaping that feeling, which many of you may feel now. I just thought I should come back to tell you that things do get better, however much you don't believe they will. I can't sit here and promise you things will be perfect, I still have my bad days. I can say though that the strongest thing I ever did was continue living when I no longer wanted to. Please believe you are strong too, cause I know you are. Thank you to everyone on here who were there at my lowest of times, and I only hope I can be as helpful to others in the way you were helpful to me.
