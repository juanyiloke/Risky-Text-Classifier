Is This A Trait Of Happier People? Some call it "counting up from zero."  If one expects perfection or near perfection in oneself or others, can this sometimes be a recipe for disappointment?  It is like expecting 100% and noticing every deviation from that level [counting down]?  Are happier people, assuming no organic brain pathology, the ones who count up from zero?  What did this person do today that was more than nothing?  What single brave, strong, wise, beautiful or good act did the person do today that was more than doing nothing at all? Did the person get up and feed and nourish the trillions of cells in their human body?  Great!  Bravo!  That's a little act of strength, bravery, wisdom and goodness. Is it that people who start from zero and count up appreciate every little thing that has some goodness in it while those who start from 100 and count down are joylessly on the lookout for any flaws?  I wonder?Love Letters To Our BrainOur little three pound brains do so much for us and work to keep us alive 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Did you ever write a love letter to your brain, or a love poem. If so, please share it here . . . even if it is just a few comforting words. Here is mine:I love you, my little brain. I love with an unconditional love. There are no limits on my affection for you. There are no strings attached. You don't have to earn my love. You don't have to do anything special for me for me to love you. I will always love you, no matter what happens. I love you more than anyone. You can never lose my love. Mistakes, big and small in the past, present and future are not important compared to my love for you. They are already forgiven. You don't have to prove yourself to me. You don't have to attain any ideals for me to love you. Even if you fail at everything, I will still love you. If we find ourselves one day living homeless on the street. I will still love you. If we find ourselves . . locked up . . . in a mental hospital or anywhere else, I will still love you. If you are condemned and judged by others, I will not judge or condemn you. I will always love you. While others may withhold love from you for "good reasons", I never will. You have been my best of best friends in life. You have loved me more than any lover, 24/7. I will always love you and stand by your side . . . no matter what. Sudden Realizations That Improved Your Depressions/anxietyToday I realized that 99.99% of morality exists because we don't live permanently marooned and totally alone on a desert island.    What does a person who is permanently alone on a desert island have to worry about?  Food.  Clean water. Health and illness.  Poisonous plants and wild animals.  Heat and cold.  Shelter.   And if one didn't prioritize those properly, one would suffer the consequences.  There would be a close relationship between life or death matters and the sense of urgency and importance that generates stress.  One would not have to worry about ettiquette or manners on a desert island.  One would not have to worry about being liked or fitting in.  Success would be tied to basic matters.  So many "Thou shalts" and "Thou shalt nots" would be inapplicable in the circumstances.  Matters of high morality: murder, assault, theft . . . those crimes would be impossible.  And what about all the little shoulds?   Being one minute late for work.  Having mismatched socks.  Signaling before changing lanes.  Not picking one's nose.  Being "cool."  Using the right fork at a fancy dinner party.  Alone on a desert island, life-and-death stress would be tied to life and death matters.  One could not be depressed about being unattractive or unpopular.  Is it possible that we are civilizing ourselves to death? What Is Enough -- The Question?Every society including that smallest of societies, the human family, transmits to its members an idea of what is enough when ideals are concerned: 1] what is a good enough son or daughter, relative, spouse, companion, friend or parent2] what is enough strength and bravery3]what is enough intelligence and education4]what is enough physical fitness and health5]what is enough ambition or success or popularity6]what is enough relationship or aloneness7]what is enough attention to physical appearance8]what is enough ethical behavior                                       and so on... Cultures, societies, groups and families can and do disagree on where to draw the line.  Wherever the line is drawn, a lesson is taught:  For example,  past this point is ... weakness, cowardliness, laziness, unattractiveness, stupidity, foolishness, unhealthiness, workaholic-ness, ethical evil and so on.  In depression it can often be helpful to try to think where "what is enough" has been taught to one and whether it is realistic or in need of some revision.  This is because wherever the "enough" point is set, everything past that point can be a cause of sadness, anger, frustration an stress and anxiety about the future. The Premise: "it Is Good To Feel Bad" . . .This is a premise [an assumption] that the deeper levels of cognitive psychology calls into question.  It is a powerful, but often subconscious premise in much depressogenic thinking.  Cognitive psychology brings this "premise" into the light of day and attempts to look at it with eyes wide open.  The human race has a difficult time determining where the balance point between good self-interest and good altruism resides. What is the effect on the human brain when it is conditioned to believe that feeling bad most of the time is good?  Cognitive psychology looks at the premises of a variety of philosophical anthropologies, which are often "implicit" in a person's thinking processes; hidden assumptions:  "It is good to feel bad most of the time."  ???  "To feel good most of the time is morally bad."  ???  "How good 'should' a person feel, most of the time?"  ???  "How bad 'should' a person feel, most of the time."  ??? Everyone of us in born into a family as its weakest and most powerless member.  Everyone of us is "taught", implicitly or explicitly or in some combination, where one "should" feel good or bad.  When cognitive psychology "looks at this," it is reaching its deepest level of analysis:  it is going beyond superficial phenomena to the "root" of the matter.  One cannot remove a plant by just removing the leaves and stem.  To remove a plant, for good or ill, requires removing the root.  Every school of psychology, shares with every philosophy an idea of "where" the dividing line between "good" self-interest and "good" altruism "should" be drawn.   There really is no "value-free" psychology any more than there are "value-free" philosophies of life. Learning To Love One's Brain . . .Many a child grows up learning how to take his or her brain for granted; how it drive it, how to force expectations on it or make demands upon it.  And many a child grows up learning how t be hard on his or her brain, how to scold and punish it, even withhold love from it.  But how many children learn another set of skills, balancing set of skills:  how to love the brain, encourage it, comfort it, console it, honor it and have compassion and understanding for it. ? At about three pounds and the size of a head of cauliflower, the brain is not an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-seeing, all perfect Being.  But one's brain works 24/7 to keep one alive and healthy.  It monitors the sensory input of millions of cells; regulates hundreds of essential functions and subconscious processes information from trillions of nerve cells.  Is at least one way out of some depressed moods simply loving the brain, perhaps for the first time?Seeing Mistakes In Perspective . ..The biggest and most tragic mistake a person can make is one that results in the loss of their life or the life of someone else.    If you are alive today and have not committed a murder, then any other mistakes you might have made today are small in comparison.  To put it another way, if you have lived this day in such a way that you have survived it and allowed others to survive it, that is a great victory.  All other so-called "successes" and "failures" pale in significance compared to this.What Is An Emotion?One school of contemporary psychology, called Cognitive Behavioral Psychology looks at "emotion" this way: Humans are not simply organisms that always react in simple stimulus-response reactions like microbes do.  Often human reactions follow a pattern of event...interpretation of event...feeling.The process can occur so fast [nanoseconds] that the "interpretation of event" part is unconscious.  In CBT, emotions are called thoughts-with-sensations.  Certain "thoughts" to certain "people" are connected to sensations, sometimes strong sensations:  gasps, rapid breathing, sinking feeling in one's stomach, cold chill, uncomfortable body heat, hairs on the back of one's neck standing on end, shallow breathing, tension in neck, back muscles, tightening of jaw.  CBT calls these "hot" thoughts or e-motions.  They have a bodily sensation aspect and a thought aspect.  For example, boss gives one more work than other employees.  Thought content might be "unfair!"  Sensations may be feeling flushed, tenseness in muscles.An event does not necessarily "cause" an emotion in every case. The equation  230+9886-441+221-13=x might cause less sensation or less intense sensation than loss of a job, breakup of a relationship, major illness.A lot of unconscious but powerful "cognitive processing" goes into emotion.A class is going on a field trip involving a plane flight.One student feels excited because she loves flyingOne student feel scared because he is scared of flyingOne student feels sad because he had other plansOne student feels angry because his parents won't let him goOne student feels annoyed because he doesn't want to goA single event can "elicit" different thoughts in different people and hence different e-motions. This is my understanding of the CBT idea of emotion in a nutshell.  I am just a student.  Cognitive Behavior Therapy is based on the idea that while events cannot always be changed or avoided, it is always possible to alter how one "cognitively processes" or "interprets" events so that bad feelings are not "inevitable" or "permanent" in many cases.Ethics And Depression . . .Those who study ethics usually distinguish between 1.  Objective responsibility and 2.  Subjective responsibility. Objective responsibility concerns reasonable moral norms and whether they are kept or broken.  This is the objective dimension of ethics.  But there is also a subjective dimension to ethics. To be "fully" responsible for an action, a person [moral agent] must be fully aware and fully free.  "Fullness" of awareness and freedom is often prevented by impediments which can reduce completeness to incompleteness:  There can be a genetic impediment to full voluntariness.  There can be strong emotions which make calm and careful deliberation difficult or impossible.  Things like fatigue, weakness or illness can impede full voluntariness.  Being "divided" can impede voluntariness.  For example, one does something where part of oneself has a contrary wish.  A "contrary wish" can sometimes indicate lack of full voluntariness.  Duress and physical and psychological compulsions can reduce voluntariness.  Subjective responsibility depends on voluntariness.  It is one thing to see that a reasonable norm has or has not been broken.  It is something quite different to determine the level of voluntariness in the person who violated the reasonable norm.  This has often been expressed poetically as "no one can see into the heart of another."  I cannot say with absolute certitude or even practical certitude that someone has violated a reasonable moral norm with "full knowledge and awareness" and "full freedom." Depression and other illnesses like it can powerful reduce complete voluntariness.  We cannot with certainty know whether a certain action has sprung from the very core of a human being or from elements  interfering with that core.  This makes judging objective responsibility often easier in comparison with the question of subjective responsibility. There are ethical philosophies which deny the distinction between objective and subjective responsibility.  One type of ethics views human beings as machines without any free will.  Another ethics views human beings as angels or beings possessed of infinite knowledge and freewill.  Most ethical philosophies teach some version of "finite" freedom.  There are other ethics too.  One's ethics can powerfully influence [consciously or unconsciously] one's view of depression.
