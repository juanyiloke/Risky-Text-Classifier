  RecoveringAs some of you know, I have been very depressed and suicidal for the past month or so from a combination of financial problems and social phobia. Yesterday, I finally got back some of the money that was stolen a few months ago. That portion alone is enough to pay off my bills, some of Mom's debts, and to repair the damages that my "other side" did to the house . Not to mention sometherapy . The rest of the money will be paid within 2 weeks.In the past month, I acquired a habit of emotional eating. I'd eat cookies and small cakes, which I don't eat at all on my good days. Today, I had no urges at all to eat junk food. Not even my favorite  food, bean pie, which I often eat to celebrate things.I ordered some business supplies a few days ago, and they are all here now. I printed my ads and have been putting them (posters) out in public for much of this afternoon. It's been weeks since I've cared aboutworking , plus, I couldn't even afford  new  supplies lately.And I've been in a good mood all day. I haven't been anything but suicidal, depressed , angry, and paranoid in weeks. I finally got the long  walk in the sun I wanted since the warm days started. And I didn't feel like hurting everyone I saw.
