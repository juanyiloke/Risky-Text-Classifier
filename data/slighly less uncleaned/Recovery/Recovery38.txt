The Motivation To Exercise?So a few months ago I downloaded the exercise programs Insanity as well as Hip Hop Abs. I haven't done such a great job in keeping a routine this summer, as I'm a really lazy person in general (seriously... I am a huge couch potato haha). I'll start doing it two or three days, take a long break and start over. I keep trying to remember in the back of my mind that "look, I'll look so much better... and I'll be able to fit all my clothes again." Then my lazy self is like "no, I don't want to get up from this spot" so I don't.I guess I'd love advice on how some of you motivate yourself to get up and exercise, and keep in the routine? I'd like to hear how you did it!Thanks in advance for answering!
