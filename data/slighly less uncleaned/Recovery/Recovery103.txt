LonelinessI have found myself for some time now wanting to talk more about my depression outside of what my therapist and I talk about. I have had this overwhelming urge to share my depression with a select handful of coworkers so they'll at least understand why I am different than what I was several months ago when  I wasn't depressed. The other reason is that I feel so incredibly lonely at times. I spend some time with my parents and feel normal then go back to my place all alone and feel more and more out of place and lonely. I try to watch TV but sometmes that doesn't do it for me, i.e. I can't find anything of interest or I struggle to be able to watch TV because I compare the happy lives of the characters to my own. I have found some solace in reading and am determined to get back into a support group (DBSA) I was involved with several years ago when I got depressed before. I also plan to make a concerted effort to have my family call me at work on a daily basis to check in on me and give me words of encouragement. Sorry for the novel above. What do you do to keep yourself occupied at work and when you're not at work and mostly alone in your place?
