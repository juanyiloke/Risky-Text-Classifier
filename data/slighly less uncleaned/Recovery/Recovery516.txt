  I haven't been around in awhile, and for a pretty good reasonHey all :]You may or may not know me. I used to float around here a lot but I've been gone for awhile. The reason?I'm doing fucking great . I got through several funks on my own and I'm now studying at the college of my dreams. I'm in a wonderful, stablerelationship . I have several networks of amazing friends and I'm adjusting well to life after moving out. I want to keep it short , but I also want to thank you guys for being an immensely important support to me during my tough times. I can't say I'll be around here often with how busy I am in school, but I'll try to pop in every once in awhile. Thanks again, I hope you're all doing well.  ~Snowy is (No Longer) Alone
