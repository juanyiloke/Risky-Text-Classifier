you are all amazing :3Ive been noticing this lately, and its kind of ironic, but very many of the people Ive met who have been depressed, feeling hopeless, and suicidal, have really been the nicest, most caring and loving people Ive ever met. Sure we all have our downsides, but honestly, we have a lot more to offer this world than we think. There are a lot of people who tell us how to be happy, often saying that we have to change who we are and accept that people arent going to like us if we dont, but I know for a fact that this is bullshit. You all are perfect the way you are and you shouldnt let anyone try to tell you otherwise. If you dont love yourself, find yourself, find the person within you that you love, only you know who that is. Just remember, you all are great people, who deserve to be happy and through these hardships, have truly earned the right to happiness.
