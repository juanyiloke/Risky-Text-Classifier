  Never thought I would post here!!________________________________________I think I can honestly say that I have turned a corner in my depression. I've struggled with depression and anxiety/panic for most of my life. Over the last 4 years I've been on a journey that never seemed to end. My recovery started with a complete emotional break down. It wasn't until that happened that my family noticed that something was wrong. I was very near suicide. They took me to see a psychiatrist and he began the long trip to where I am now. He gave me the medicine that gave me the strength to begin to change. He explained many of the symptoms of depression which I thought were just bad characteristics in my personality. That helped so much with the shame, which was so powerful that I almost couldn't bear it. I kept a journal of my feelings and experiences. It was at this time that I returned to a spiritual path that I'd been on before. When I got a little bit of a grip on life I realized that I couldn't commit suicide without destroying so many other lives as well. There are family members and young children in my life. It would draw attention from the police in the country in which we live as foreigners. I was trapped in life. My mother is 95--so I could have as much as 30 years to go. I couldn't just stay where I was. To make it less dramatic I called it reprogramming my subconscious. Even if I am genetically wired to this illness--both parents were like this-- I could at least try to train my mind towards a better position.I guess I'm lucky to have a spiritual path to follow. Carving one out for oneself might be more difficult. But there is so much positive stuff out there. I'm retired so time isn't an issue either. I stated spending about 3 hours a day meditating and reading spiritual books. I stopped watching movies and TV shows with negative content. I've become quite conversant with teen age lit and TV and movies. Slowly, slowly, with the help of my Dr. who kept changing my meds I felt stronger. Reading about love and happiness and how it is in me and not from outside of me help. I need logical arguments to be convinced not just rhetoric and there are logical arguments I can accept. My journal helps. Finally I reconnected on this site where I feel I am talking to kindred spirits and I can forgive the other people in my life for not seeming to care. How can they know what it feels like?So for now I am stronger and have a goal. I trust the goal. When you read about spiritual people you see how many, many years they worked for their peace and love. Patience and perseverance are my mantra. I hope this helps
