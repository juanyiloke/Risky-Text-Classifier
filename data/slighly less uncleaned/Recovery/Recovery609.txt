  Negative Thoughts TransformedI got this exercise  from a book. You take negative beliefs and thoughts, and turn them into something positive. The idea is to mentally train  yourself to stop brooding over negative thoughts and start practicing and believing in the positive. Here is some of mine right now, with the alternative. Other people are welcome to share  as well. I think this is a great exercise. I’m not good enough = I am a worthwhile personLife is too overwhelming = I can adequately handle life.I’m ugly = I am a beautiful person inside and out. I’m too heavy/thin = My body  is perfect as is.I’ll never reach my goals  = I am capable of anything. I’ll always  be dependent on my parents = I am an amazingly independent woman.I don’t have much to offer a mate = I am an incredible, loving person. I’m unlovable = The universe fills me with the ability to be loved.I’m too mentally ill to amount to anything = I have accomplished a lot in my life .I’m inadequate dealing with life = I am capable of balancing life’s forces.I’m scared of everything = I am a brave young lady. I’m scared of driving = Driving is not that bad, just takes getting used to.I’ll never be able to function like a normaladult  = I am doing the best  I can at this moment.
