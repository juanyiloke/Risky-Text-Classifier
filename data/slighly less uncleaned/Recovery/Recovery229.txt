  my little success________________________________________I have battled low level, persistent depression all my adult life. All traditional modalities as well as non-traditional therapies failed to make better. In my eternal search for relief swim found and tried Thai kratom caps and to my astonishment found that low doses completely alleviated my symptoms! Last time I have bought it online at kratomunderground.com and it was really comfortable. Hope this helps others suffering from this terrible condition
