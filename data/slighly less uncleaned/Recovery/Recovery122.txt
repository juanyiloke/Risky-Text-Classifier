We Are Ok!!!!!!!!!Wanted to post this in the One Step At A Time forum. Because if I can get through these past nine days, I can get through anything :)We have been without power for the past nine days. We are in Long Island, New York and were hit directly by Sandy.No heat, freezing temps daily. Only the stove top working (not sure why my oven did not?).DD#1 becomes ill, DD#2 becomes ill the next day. Thank GOD the Dr. knows us so well. She called a script for them to the pharmacy. We could not use the gas to see her.My MIL had her LAST round of chemo this Monday. No hair, refusing to go elsewhere for warmth, shaking day and night like a little hairless dog. :(.My DH becomes ill, and eventually so do I. Our primary doc has a generator and we go (walk 2 miles) to see her. All 4 of us have strep.Finally got gas on a short line, only 25 minutes! And now day 9. Is that snow? It is not even funny. At least 4 inches of snow. And the power crews came to our block and still worked in the snow on the cherry pickers. We are now warm, have meds, and are ok :)Sorry to write so weird like. I am tired and going to bed. I promise I will be on tomorrow (power permitting!) Please pray if you believe in such for the 100 plus who have passed on, and the thousands who lost their homes.KellyTiggerluvrPS: Yes, I know their are typos ;)
