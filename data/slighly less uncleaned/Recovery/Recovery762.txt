What next? (new to online forums)Hi everyone. I have depression and anxiety and have been taking medication for a little over a month. I feel like my anxiety has really started to settle, but my depression not so much. I am fighting with my boyfriend all the time and am finding it difficult to feel happy. It almost feels like I have lost the ability.  Along with medication I have changed my diet to a much healthier one, I also take short walks to relieve tension and stress. Could anyone else suggest other things I could do? I am taking my negative feelings out (unintentionally) on my boyfriend and it's putting a huge strain on our relationship. I really want to feel happy and a little more carefree again. Please help.
