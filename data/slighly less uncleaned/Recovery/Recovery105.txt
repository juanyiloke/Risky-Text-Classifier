A Tip To Help You Be Kind To Yourself When DepressedI'd been feeling numb-depressed for a while and really felt like I needed to cry it out. I thought about watching a tear jerker movie but started listening to my all-time favourite 'you're not alone' song. For me it's 'Nightminds' by Missy Higgins. The part that always gets me is:I was crying like a baby in no time. Not weeping, but heaving sobbing that just wouldn't stop. I don't know why I did it, but I started recording myself with my webcam in that state.I have so much empathy for others who are suffering, but I'm so cruel to myself. It's all negative self-talk that just keeps me in that dark, empty hole.But as I watched myself as others might see me, I felt bad for that person. I didn't want to tell her she was hopeless and things would never get better. I wanted to tell her the opposite. And I cried for her-that person feeling so much pain. I would never say such mean things to someone in that state, so why do I say them to myself?It wasn't some magical cure that ended the depressive state, but it helped me understand with both my heart and mind that I contribute to my own depression and I need to be kinder to myself. I've always known that, but now I feel it. Just thought I'd share it in the hope that others might feel it too.
