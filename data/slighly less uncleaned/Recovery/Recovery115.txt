It's A Journey, But It Gets BetterThought I'd write. Maybe just to re-read my own progress. I haven't written on the forum or started a topic in so long. Haven't had the need to. My spirits are holding their own right now and I look back on all the years it took me to get where I am today. I am Schizo-affective. I've been to the bottom more times then I can will ever admit. I just have found my schedule, my drugs, and my support system that has been working for me.I'm about to return to college. Very big step for me. I thought I'd never go back. Here I am though about to embark on my first step toward the rest of my therapy. I call it therapy because life has been one big therapy session for me. I know I may go back to the hole of depression and all the other horrible symptoms the goes with being mentally ill. It has taken a lot for me to get to this pace of acceptance of my illness. I say pace because sometimes the pace is very slow to strengthen. I feel strong now. Stronger then I have ever felt.I have also finally have the courage to make a goal. That ability was lost in me. I feel I have figured out my niche in life and I am able to see myself take those steps into the future. Ofcourse small at first , two classes at the college to begin. Just three months. I can commit to that. My plans will continue cause I have a goal, my destiny , I feel. I won't bother to worry how long it will take me to accomplish my goal. What am I here for anyway but to grow mentally and spiritually. Now I know why I'm here. It has taken 48 years to figure it out. I may not even accomplish my desire before I die but that is ok too..It's all about the Journey.
