  I just told themPeople who've seen some of my topics will know this already, but I'm transsexual.Anyways, I just told my parents. I sent them an email explaining, because I didn't think I'd be able to do it in person or even on the phone, and also because I know how frequently my mom checks her email.It seems it worked out... It was late at night so they just phoned me to quickly say it's okay, and that we'd talk about it in more detail tomorrow.Now I guess I'm going to sleep. Tomorrow awaits. Don't know what it'll bring.
