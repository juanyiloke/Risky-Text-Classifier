What Is Your Intention Today?A member who used to visit the forum regularly once created an intention thread, where we could track our intentions for the day/week/situation. It's different in that, instead of only writing what your goals are (return a library book, avoid a coworker, confront a sibling, mow the grass), we would write our intentions.  So, while confronting a sibling, my intention might be to maintain self-respect and setting a boundary at the same time. At work, my intention might be to practice behaving professionally and not get too close to coworkers. And so on. I loved that thread and miss the member who created it! I'm not sure how interested the current participants are, but we'll see what happens. Today, my intention is to channel my emotions into a writing project and stay focused on becoming the person I want to be.
