Batkid will make you feel better about the human raceThere was this extremely sweet story in the American news today about a boy and how an entire city helped him make his dream come true. I am posting it here because I think sometimes people need reminders that not everybody is bad. Basically a boy who has been fighting leukemia since he was 18 months old (he is now 5), wanted to be a superhero for a day. So with the help of the Make a Wish Foundation and virtually the entire city of S.F. helped make his dream an reality in one of the most elabrate set ups I ever saw including baseball team, media, and President Obama.
