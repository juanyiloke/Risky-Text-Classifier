  felling better; resulving thingswell, since i first posted here, I:*Started to regulate mysleep  withsleeping pills *I decided not to bring up my brother's abuse to my family, i dont see a point. i can ruin his life , but he is married with kids, so i will let him live his life with the guilt. I talked to their kids and it seems they have never been assualted by him. my sister has no memory , and i do not wish to bring it up to her unless she wants to.*I plan not to get on the internet  much anymore, i already seen everything it has to offer, so why waste my life on it?*I am going to quit my visual communication  course in college to become a police officer. i want to hep people in need( no one deserves anything related to the things i been though.)*I bought a bike to get out more. I live in a forest area so i go offfroading and it is really fun.(despite the occasional chain slip.)*I am going to write my stories more often. IF i want to be a writer, i need to stop telling people my ideas  and bring it to life.*i also started cooking.....i like tacos.thanks ttl, you didn't do much, but venting help  me overcome it.Thanks.
