  My brain hurtsI got a new (second-hand) Toughbook yesterday, but it had Windows XP SP 3 on it which sucked. It's just too darn Microsofty. So I decided to put Ubuntu on it. It's a bit complicated because the laptop doesn't have an optical drive and doesn't boot from USB.So I set up a DHCP and TFTP server on my desktop, networked the two and used netboot to boot the toughbook and download the right version of ubuntu onto it (after downloading  the wrong version twice.) And, to my amazement, it's actually working. Just having a bit of trouble with the GUI but it's getting sorted.I actually have not much understanding of what most of all that stuff means. Still, I persevered, swore a lot and at one point tested out just how tough my toughbook is by throwing the fucking thing on the ground :=] Yeah, it is tough.Anyway, I achieved something.
