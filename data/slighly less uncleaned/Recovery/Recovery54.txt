Keeping Track Of AppointmentsThere's a pinned thread for keeping track of taking your pills but I need suggestions for how to keep track of appointments better. I can't be the only one who has difficulty keeping track of appointments, when prescriptions need renewed, everything. I've tried diaries and my phone, but stuff still slips through. I'd be happy for this to be pinned if mods think that is a good idea. Last week I had an appointment I forgot to go to. I was having a relatively smallish MH crisis (if such a thing exists!) and only mentally surfaced after a few days and happened on something that reminded me. It was bad I had missed it because it was for treatment for pain-relief & the pain feeds in to my MH problems in a hideous vicious circle. Even if all I could have done was phone to cancel it beforehand instead of phoning afterwards to apologise and grovel for another appointment, that would be infinitely preferable. Have you found or created a smart or basic as you like ways to make it easier to keep track of your calendar?
