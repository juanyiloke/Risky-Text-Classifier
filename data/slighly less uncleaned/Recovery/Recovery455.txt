  Graduation from TTL: Recovery and freedomWonderful people of TTL, while reading and listening to your thoughts and feelings, and with all your help (one person majorly in particular) I announce with a mixture of sadness and joy that I may be leaving you. With a lot of time and a lot of effort I've started to turn my life around and feel the weight of depression  and sadness get lighter and lighter. I've also started taking an all natural supplement called GABA and it has worked wonders for me. I feel human. That's the best I know how to explain it. I found that my social fears and anxieties were holding me back from obtaining what I really want in life and I can honestly say I've made great progress in overcoming them. I am by no means cured with no problems toface , but I feel I have the tools necessary to face any challenge life can throw at me. I feel like I had fallen down and TTL was there to help me back to my feet and I now feel I have the courage to have it let go and start walking on my own.Now, please don't read this and have it dampen your spirit by thinking "this will never happen to me and I'll never feel this way" because thats COMPLETELY not true. I blindly believed that I would be the way I was for the rest of my life  and there was nothing I could do about it but I made the concious decision to go out  in the world and do exactly what I was afraid of until it became less stressful and scary. I found that the worst possible thing you can do is nothing. The worst thing you can do is wake up everyday and make no conscience effort to better yourself and to expand your horizons. We really do only live once and if your not controlling your life then who is? Well I hope you all continue to make progress and allfind  your true path in life. Stay beautiful TTL
