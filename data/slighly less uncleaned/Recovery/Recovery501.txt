  Today is better.Every now and again I have a day where I feel a little more hopeful, a little less sad. Today is one of those days. There's no rhyme or reason to it; I just woke up in an ok mood. I wanted to have it formally down in writing that today, for no reason at all, I wasn't depressed. I tend to focus a lot of attention on bad days, and forget that some days are beautiful or nice. I just joined not too long ago, but I believe this forum has helped me in someway. I've been reading a lot of the stories, and I hear my thoughts or feelings in your stories. I really thought for a while that I was totally alone and that no one else could possibly understand the depths of my emotions. This forum showed me otherwise and has given me a lot to think about in the few days of I've been apart of it.
