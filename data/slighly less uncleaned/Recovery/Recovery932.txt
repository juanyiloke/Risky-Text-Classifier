Never give up!You are here for a reason and that reason can only be filled by you. If you don't know what that purpose is think about what role you have been born into. I was born into the role of a daughter, and sister. Two roles I am finding gives me plenty of purpose. Now I am a wife and mother and this has doubled my purpose. Let's not forget a friend and an acquaintance. As you can see I have more than enough purpose to excel in these roles. Only I can do them as I am supposed to. No one can replace me or do them better. I can always improve and this is something I strive to do, but I am confident that I am needed in this life to fill these roles. If I wasn't I wouldn't be here. So remember when those negative thoughts come by that try to tell you different, it's not true!!! Have a blessed day.
