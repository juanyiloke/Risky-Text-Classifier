  I just got my grades backIt's my first year of University. I barely got accepted in. My average in grade 12 was quite a bit below the minimum entry requirement, and even with a lot of effort in summer school I didn't manage to boost it enough (I was 0.5% below the minimum 70%). However, I had still managed to boost my average by 7 or 8% to 69.5%, and that impressed admissions enough to let me in on academic probation.I've been a little worried though, because everyone always  says that in your first year of University, your average generally drops by about 10% from what you had in Grade 12 (on second thought I wasn't a little worried, I was REALLY worried). Because of the academic probation, I get kicked outimmediately if my grade in any class of myclasses  is below 60% in the first year too. Which sounded like trouble for me.But today the grades were put up online. 71, 75, 76, 79. My average is 75.25%. I actually improved by almost 6%! I get to stay in school!I'm feeling so amazing right now.
