update for all my friendsI just wanted to thank anyone who told me to shave my head. I did and I felt a lot better. When I was with my friends this weekend I had a blast and I think it was because I wasn't self conscious about my hair. I was able to talk to a few girls and it seemed like they actually enjoyed talking to me. Only one problem this weekend is one of buddies asked this girl when we were in the car if she was still going out with so and so and she said no. Then as a joke he said "why don't you get with (me)" sacrastically. Which put her on the spot to either say "No", laugh awkwardly, or sarcastically say yes oh baby. She choose the best option which was laugh awkwardly but I was kind of pissed how my friend put me in that positon. However that was just a half hour out of 4 days so I didn't let it ruin my time which I think is a little step forward.
