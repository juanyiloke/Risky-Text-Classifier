Overwhelmed,Felt Lost,Hi this Snow,  and until recently I was so overwhelmed with caring for my wife, Anxiety,  short term memory loss& Depression,  Sadness, her not wanting to move or engage in activities,  she has case manager a great team of people behind her and these people I truly love n respect . In some of the articles Others shared, have enlightened me to a whole new level of care & understanding.  I recently left work retired early and suffer servere arthritis, oesteo, rheumatoid,  and now oesteoperosis,  mild depression, feeling completely out of water, at 53 and no longer a manager and loss of  identity,  so to speak. I tried to do everything,  mother hen, cook, clean, house unpack still after 5 months, then a lightning bolt ,,,   beyondblue.org ,I started reading, I stopped nagging, about weight loss for us both  and I realised my best friend was less motivated when I was sad. Thanks to everyone for sharing your stories,  today I did 1 n half hours in the garden, close to mother nature, cooked for wifey, my wonderful supporting mum inlaw, and went the ymca for water exercice for us both.Sometimes you have to stop smell roses, and realise what you can do...  Do slowly, and enjoy it, I call my arthritis,  RUST, is what it is, we're away to go but it's nice to feel happy again. Finding inner peace,
