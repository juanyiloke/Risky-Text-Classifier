financial counselling?I put a question mark after the topic as Im not sure if thats the service Im actually after. I know a guy who has bipolar, who had an episode and put $15 grand on his credit card during it. He told me there was some organisation that helped him waver the total debt on his cc, because he had a diagnosed mental illness.I dont have bipolar, but I have diagnosed dysthymic depression and an anxiety disorder, and I was wondering if there'd be something like this financial service that could help me. I have a $10,000 credit card debt, and Im not in a situation at the moment to be making repayments. It would be of great help if there was something that could take down my debt to a more manageable amount. Even though Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 20 years, it often seems the system views depression and anxiety as 'not bad enough,' and there is more help for psychotic disorders.If anyone could offer any advice, thatd be great, thankyou:)
