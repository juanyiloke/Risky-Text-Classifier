Officially depression free.My diagnosis was Borderline Personality Disorder, Clinical anxiety, Major depressive disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.I knew myself that the depression was gone on the mix of mirtazapine/counselling that I improved on but today the consultant psychiatrist has taken away my diagnosis of MDD. I am so excited now as I can help people overcome it like I did. I phoned WildCherry to tell her 'cos she's known me from the start and been there for me all through this and so have many of you....thank you so much.. Thanks everyone so much for the ups/downs help throughout the years. You guys are amazing. It feels so good to say I am free from it  Now to work on the anxiety, PTSD and BPD.I CAN DO THIS
