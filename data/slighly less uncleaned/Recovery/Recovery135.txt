Songs That Make You FeelSome songs trigger, some songs bring comfort. Some songs can make you smile, some can make you cry, and sometimes both can be good. Sometimes crying is exactly what we need, sometimes we need something that will make us smile. In bad periods, songs with lyrics that we can relate or react to can bring healing, whether it is by making us aware of feelings we didn`t know we were hiding or by helping us put words to those feelings. I need to cry sometimes, feel something. What songs brings up emotions in you? What makes you feel something that`s valuable to you, or cleanse you in some way? I thought it`d be good to perhaps share some of these.
