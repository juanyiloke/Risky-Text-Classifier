  I swear this works like magicI am assuming that this has been said before, but I feel that if it has helped me, a stubborn individual, it can help anyone.I was not really "Depressed " to the moping around extent, but lost. Not with a goal , but - WHERE TO BEGIN? Why should I do it? What will keep me going to reach it? How do I condition my mind to strive for things I want.-I read the book "Tough Times Never Last But Tough People Do""Psycho Cybernetics""Think and grow rich"I will continue to read them throughout my life  because as I've said before, they have worked like magic . I seriously consider you guys looking into them!!!
