  a speechi have bi polar, i have had it sense 1999, for about 7 years i didn't know what planet i was on and at times i thought i was a ghost, after 7 years i came back, i did not believe in anything and i had always been a chirstian, during that time i had about 22 suicide attempts over a year i met my wife during this time, reformed my faith moved 850 miles to be with my wife,i know this is not a religious section but god provided the way for me, my live has completely turned around, if your wondering if any one feels the way you do, well i do, i know your trouble and the sadnest, and i know you can come back, maybe not to what you were, but to something even better, in 09 my old doc pulled me off my meds and i did not know my own fiancee(at that time, she is now my wife) i got a new doc and i came back to this world, i have a whole team of professionals working to help me and i do mean a team and now they tell me they can not tell anything is wrong with me and they are trained to see that, they say it is possible i will never have a break down again, this is a miracle, i am not cured, there is no cure for this and i still can not work, i am a better person now, i know the hopeless feelings the weight of depression just hanging over you, i don't have all the answers, i don't know why this happens to people, but there is hope, so if you feel alone don't, because you are not and if your losing hope, well don't, there is hope, and if you need a friend, i will be yours and if your wondering if anyone loves you, well don't, cause i love you, you are loved and i understand, it is easy to say but my words come from my heart out of love as i have been taught by my king. i have been where you are at, i am not preaching religion, just offering love no matter what your faith, no matter who you are, all i can say is don't stop trying thanks for readingwith hugs and much lovecrims
