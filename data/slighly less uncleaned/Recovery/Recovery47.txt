How Long Did Your Depressive Episodes Last? - Recovery/remissionI have had 3 depressive episodes in the last 20 years and I am currently experiencing my fourth.Each prior episode lasted about 6-7 months from time of start to when I could confidently say I was recovered and had no more symptoms.My question to everyone here is how long did your episodes last and what were the signs you could tell you were recovering or your episode was going into remission?I know recovery/remission is possible from what I have experienced in the past. I can't lose hope.
