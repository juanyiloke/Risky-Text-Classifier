  Some Changes I noticed about my recoveryHi all,On the process of my recovery, I have noticed many changes and things about myself.I used to be scared of feeling needed by someone. The other day, my best friend had to go the hospital as he is having heart problems. He is a vulnerable adult  and didn't have anyone to go with him to the hospital. There I was, scared because I have always been the one needing someone to be there for me. The role was vice versa. I needed to be the strong one and the one who was needed. I went with him and felt better with myself. The worry has gone andfeel better  to support him.The second thing, when you feel depressed you see the whole world as a negative place. When I was having that situation with Jason, many people told me I was a kind and nice person. I couldn't see that. But with being there for my friend, I realise it must be true. Even the doctor told me I was as my friend is a vulnerable adult. Now I believe in myself and know the gift I have with caring for people. A gift that I am proud to have.
