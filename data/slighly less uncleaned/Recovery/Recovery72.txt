Things Do Get Better :)Thought I should post here to show there is hope no matter how hopeless you feel and I think it is my first time in this part of the forum!    After weeks and months of feeling suicidal (see my other posts) I suddenly felt better and back to my old self this afternoon and all night. I feel SO happy, which I haven't felt in a longgg time! I'm not sure the exact reason, it may be the medication kicking in (although I didn't think this would happen and nearly stopped it the other day, as this is the first time I have felt any good effect from it after being on it over 2 months!). I just hope this feeling lasts...even though I know it won't last forever. It's amazing how your whole perspective on life can change by just the depression being gone for a bit and my thoughts are positive for the first time in a while!  I've still got insomnia, but it doesn't matter that I'm awake all night because at least it feels good to be. I hope I can make someone else have hope that things will improve!
