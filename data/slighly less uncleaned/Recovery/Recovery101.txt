Journaling As A ReminderThis is my first time posting here, so I apologize in advance if this is in the wrong place. I recently came across a journal entry I had written almost 3 years ago about my struggle with depression and a lack of motivation and direction in my life. Finding it and reading it again after so much time had passed has given me a bit of a boost in motivation, but only because it made me realize how little progress I've made since then. I've pinned it to my wall and written the words "3 years" on the first page, in hope that it will serve as a constant reminder when I start to veer off course. So far the results have been mixed. But I felt like sharing it somewhere to see if it was similar to anyone else's thoughts, and if they had found this technique helpful.
