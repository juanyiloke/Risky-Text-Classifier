its finally overIm honestly happy to be here typing this, and I finally get to say that my depression is over, for now at least.Ive been in a depression with little break for almost 8 years now, Ive been emotionless, empty, feeling like nothing mattered and that I didnt matter to anybody. But from the looks of it, my long depression is finally lifting, I feel more alive than ever, I finally have someone that honestly cares about me and I couldnt be happier to have them :3 Although Im not suicidal anymore, by no means will I be leaving the forum, Ill be here to help anyone who needs it.
