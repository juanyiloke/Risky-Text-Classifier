Poisonous EnvironmentI don't really know where I would post this, so I just put it as general. I live with my Mother, because I love her and I know if I left home she would not be able to cope without me. She has a chronic illness and is also very depressed and stresses over many things to an extreme extent. I also get very stressed, and these days I carry a lot of the emotional burden for both of us. Especially since I cannot get upset in front of her. If I do she becomes more upset, often she will even claim I do not have the same right as her to be upset. She believes we are isolated from the world (which in many ways we are). However, she encouraged my relationships with friends, even seeming to like my new friends. It has always been hard for me to make friends, and I do not have many people I call true friends.Recently, she was badgering me about things when I was stressed. She was basically repeating things I was already feeling, so I snapped at her explaining this was the case. She has blocked me off since then, explaining she no longer wants anything to do with anyone because no one cares for her. She is refusing to talk, refusing to go anywhere, even to things she used to like doing. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because she has previously accused me of secretly ganging up with my brother against her, and she believes my friends sided with me the other day.I go from feeling like running from the whole situation to wanting to stay and help, but she won't let me, and I don't know what else I can do. Normally she gets over these emotional fits quite quickly, but this is going longer, and I feel like when she does snap out of it it may be too late...
