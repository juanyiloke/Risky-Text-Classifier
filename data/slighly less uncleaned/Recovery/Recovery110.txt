Up To 3 Things To Do During The Day... How It Went, What HelpedOnce I've noticed that some accountability helps. I was doing short reports for my therapist each evening. It did help me with depression at the time and boosted my productivity. I think, it would be interesting to read about experiences of other people: what was planned, how it went and what helped.  Here some things that had helped me in the past with the report thing:¥	day at a time,¥	improving each day by small things, (staying the same is a good thing too, taking a brake is a good thing too, because to be kind to ourselves is an important thing ;)¥	taking small steps,¥	better to plan less but to do more, not to overplan (boosts my self esteem)¥	better to get things done than try to make them perfect and not be able to finish¥	being kind when judging the results.   Up to 3 things I plan for tomorrow: 1 To make a plan of taking care of health issues (even if a very sketchy one)2 The same for the mental health issues3 Maybe call a friend for some support
