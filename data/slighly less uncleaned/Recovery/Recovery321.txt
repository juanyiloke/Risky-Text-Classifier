Went back to work todayI thought I would take the honour of being the first to post a thread in the Home Straight because I think I'm on that end journey.  I went back to work today it went really well. I took some cake to break the ice, one of the nurses bought me a lovely bunch of tulips and one of the doctors brought in a huge box of chocolates. I was really touched and felt like crying but didn't and I think it was a good crying feeling from emotion cos I was very touched.On the work front I've been alocated a different line manager to the one who caused all the trouble and I'm on a phased return, 4 hours today and tomorrow, 5 hours all next week and then back to normal hours the week after if I'm up to it. I am working alongside a temp for now who covered my job so I have a full handover and don't have any backlog of work to worry about. I consider myself to be so lucky that I'm getting better in a relatively short timescale. I've been on Citalopram for 10 weeks and its certainly helped no end.I'm not back to full strength yet but I'm certainly functioning. Thank you to everyone here for helpful suggestions, listening ears and great understanding.
