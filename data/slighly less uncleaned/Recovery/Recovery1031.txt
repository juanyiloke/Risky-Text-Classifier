Changing PrioritiesI see the introductory posts, the suicide posts, the crisis posts, so many of them at the breaking point because of loneliness.At 33, I was single, I'd dated my share of women that my friends drooled after, but they always ended 'Maybe we should see other people for awhile"", "This just isn't working out" "I've found someone else"But still, single is single. I was short, but not otherwise bad looking, intelligent, good sense of humor, almost a new car, shopping for a house, making some decent money. But women came and went.I started considering what I had to offer in a long-term relationship - and on my list, most of the items were physical. I didn't really have a lot under the surface, or at least that wasn't what I presented. And on my list of what I really wanted in a woman was similar - surface, physical attributes, starting with good looks from face on down. After a while, I started adding other qualities - both of myself that I could offer, and which qualities I could accept in a woman.Once I started looking for a woman's personality, her honesty, depth of character, a good mind, patience, kindness, I found that there were quite a few women out there that matched those criteria, looking for a match in a man. And once I spent some time with such a woman, I found she brought out the best in me.And if I extended my physical priorities, to include women carrying a little extra weight, or maybe of a different race or religion, there were so many women just waiting for a man to give them a little attention.At 35, I was happily married, to a woman who fit none of my first requirements, but all of my second. She gave me the the finest15 years of my life, and we'd still be together, but she passed away,All it really took was opening my mind.
