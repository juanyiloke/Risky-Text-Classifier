  opted out of fishy gameI didn't know where else to post this but I think this forum is appropriate. I was becoming very competitive. Refreshing the page and waiting for more fish to appear. I just wanted to be the best! I knew it wouldnt be possible but I could try and it made me feel good everytime I got more fish. Well, I felt satsfied and angry and frustrated. I clicked on random links over and over again all over the TTL website waiting for the fish to appear. The flashing screens made my eyes hurt. ): Then I realized, this is stupid! So I decided to help myself by opting out of the game.
