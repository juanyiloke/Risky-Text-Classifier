Ok - I been fighting for 4-6 weeks now..... To try and get a darned work trial at a local bingo hall (organised through my jobcentre with a previous manager)... The previous manager was "waiting for head office" - but he left on Sunday. As I was down playing bingo on the Saturday night, a deputy/assistant one who'd discussed the work trial competency questions with me told me of this - so I popped down yesterday (Sept 2nd) - in order to show keenness and willing - ended up leaving details and got a swift call back (within 2 or so hours).Then I go again today - and I have been finally given the chance for two shifts! (New manager - straight talker - in without issue) - so I'm glad of the opportunity.Wednesday and Sunday - although start time on Sunday not confirmed yet - it's just under 12 hours away - so I need to sleep lol. Am there all day - but I hope that doesn't mean a post midnight finish as I have a 9.30am phlebotomy on Thursday!
