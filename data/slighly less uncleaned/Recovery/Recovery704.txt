Self HelpHi all, im pretty new to the forum and wanting some recommendations on what helps you with your depression. Although I have struggled with low self esteem and sadness throughout my life it is only recent (last 8 months) that I have been diagnosed with depression via my doctor. I am on a new medication that seems to be working without bad side effects, although early days and will now be having psychology sessions as only meds scenario didn't work. In the meantime I have found a book on the net called "Mind over Mood" which is CBT (did I get that right?) but was wondering if there is something else that has helped you. Specifically how to get rid of the all intrusive negative thoughts.Thanx in advanceHoneybean
