Does Owning A Pet Help With Anxiety/depression?Hello, I am debating getting a dog to help with my chronic anxiety/depression. Problem is, this time last year I acquired a kitten who was very hyperactive and actually increased my stress and anxiety to the point of having panic attacks. I felt so guilty having to re-home him because of my inability to cope with his personality and excessive energy. Has anyone here experienced positive outcomes from owning the "right" pet? Do you think that if I found a dog that was laid-back and liked to lounge around all day, this could work for me? I love dogs, I just have never cared for one before and I am worried that I will end up freaking out again and giving the poor thing away. :( Oh yes, I also have this pesky little thing called "adjustment disorder" wherein any big changes in my life cause me to have extreme anxiety for several weeks until I get used to the change. Thanks in advance, any advice is appreciated. :)
