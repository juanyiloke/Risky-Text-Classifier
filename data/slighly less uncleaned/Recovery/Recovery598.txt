  Please know that . . .Please know that recovery takes time, takes patience and perserverance. You need good communication with your doctor, be open with your therapist, make sure your doctor and therapist communicate as well. The first medications seldom work, be open to changes and give the meds time to work, usually 30 days to get a good flow in your system. If you get a new medicine and have a bad reaction or crash you usually know in less than a week while good medicines take longer. I had a breakdown 17 years ago and am doing my best just now. It takes time to come up from the bottom but each time can be harder or easier depending on how you look at it. Please don't give up.
