  I'm feeling betterI spiraled into depression recently, and I'm beginning to see the light. I didn't see my psychologist because my dad put it off, I still want to see him/her though.Well I did treat myself. If I hadn't, I wouldn't be making this thread. I did a number of things to help myself, but I think the big two was cutting and talking. I cut myself a little bit and I talked to the girl I like. If I want to stay out of depression I need to continue to be social, though. and the support that I got from joining this community helped me too, it gave me some courage.
