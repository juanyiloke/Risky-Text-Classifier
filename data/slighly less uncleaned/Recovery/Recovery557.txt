  Just when you think you know your family...Had a bad day yesterday- stress  atwork , depressed, lots of ugly stuff.I got home and stepped through the door. My eleven year old just looks at me, walks over and plants a huge hug and kiss and says she hopes the rest of my day is better. She is such a sweet empathic person that she just knew what I needed.A little while later, my 13 year old son comes up and puts his arms around me. I figured those days were long  gone. That was followed shortly by my 17 year old deciding to empty the dishwasher without anyone saying anything.And now today, my wife offered to leave her work early on Saturday meet me at the office when I go to my first meeting  with my new  therapist, and wait for me while I'm in with the new doc. She just wanted to show her support for what I'm going through.So maybe the really is hope for the future .  Music for a showOK TTL people. I need your help. Not for depression, but for something more fun.I'm directing an outdoor production of Shakespeare's Cymbeline this summer and I'm stuck for music. To give a very basic idea, the show is a folk tale much like The Princess Bride. But I'm having a heck of a time finding music for the show. I want something a little lighter (that kids can also hear!) and maybe evokes the feeling of a fairy tale or folk story. Any suggestions for specific music or even a music style would be welcome. I'll even give you special thanks in the program!
