I look back on when I was depressed. If I could go back in time and tell myself...All the GOOD things that were going to happen to me...I wouldn't have believed a word of it.I've been through horrible times, but the good times have been so soothing and my point is that the you in the future is probably looking back at you now and thinking "Hold on...you have no idea how good it's going to get."Thinking like this really helps me, just think back to something good you didn't expect, and realize there are a lot more of them to come in the future.
