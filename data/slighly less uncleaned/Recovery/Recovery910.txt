Have you tried taking a break from modern technology?It might just be the answer to your problems.Turn off your mobile phone for a week.Turn off your PC for a week.Turn off your 80" Plasma Television for a week.Instead why not go for long walks, exercise, read a good book, draw/paint, write, maybe listen to some relaxing music, go on a date? Just do things that dont involve sitting in front of a screen for hours on end. I'm not saying you all do this, and for some of you its what you do for a living, but I think its a good example of a change in habit, something you can experiment with, to see if it clears your head and helps you to find new ways of living that is right for you.
