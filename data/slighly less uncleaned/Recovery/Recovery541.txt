  Substantial Weight LossHey there, been along  time since I've been active on here and I've comeback mainly because I feel I once again need some guidance but I have managed to make a lot of progress, and more than I thought I ever could in such a short  time!I joined a local weight loss course that lasts 6 months and I'm on the home stretch now with 4 weeks to go and I'm already their most successful member ever (not trying to be big headed, I was actually told this! :D), I've lost justunder  6 stone now since November and I feel a lot better for it. More confidence, less breathless nights and most of all I'm bloody well bankrupt from having to buynew clothes ! haha :')Just wanted to share a bit of my success with you all before I venture off onto the board to find  some solace to the issues which I've come back here for help  with.I wish you all the best  on achieving the goals you want to accomplish. My goal for 2014 was to get to 15 stone and I've smashed that out of the ballpark by reaching 13.6 stone already! I'm far from my final goal since my final goal would be to get a six pack and stay in that kind of shape the rest of my life  but I know it's not going to be any picnic (literally, I have to eat properly now! haha) Feel free to ask me any questions, and I'll see you around!
