Relapse: What's Next?!Hi Everyone, I haven't posted on the forum in many years, but two months ago I suffered a relapse of Major Depression and decided I better try and reach out. Currently, my psychiatrist is weaning me off of Prozac (I was at 60mg and am now at 20mg) so that he can try something else. I'm also working with a Psychotherapist weekly. However, I had a really bad week last week and I believe I need something more.  I'm living abroad in France, so my resources are mostly in French. If possible, I would like to go into an intensive out-patient program or begin to build in some routines in my daily schedule of self-care. In particular, I'm looking for workbooks/ self-help books, to supplement my recovery and am a bit overwhelmed with all the options. Does anyone have any good recommendations? Or any other ideas for how to supplement my recovery? I'm also very interested in a holistic approaches, as my spiritual life is severely impacted by this relapse. Thank you in advance.
