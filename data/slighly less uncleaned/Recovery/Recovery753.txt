The Words of the WiseHi Everyone,Just thought I'd share something that has helped me a bit in dark moments.  I've been watching some YouTube videos of talks/teachings by certain 'enlightened souls' that I have a lot of respect for.  They are by Eckhart Tolle, Ajahn Brahm, and Byron Katie.  Some of you may already be familiar with these people.  Eckhart Tolle and Byron Katie are both 'normal' people that have become 'spiritual guides' after experiencing something negative in their lives that profoundly transformed their thinking, and Ajahn Brahm is an English Buddhist Monk who lives in WA.  They each have different approaches, but their fundamental message is the same......that true peace cannot come from external factors (such as spouses, friends, career, money, objects, events, etc) and that it must come from within us, and that our minds cause us suffering.  It's a bit new-agey and sounds like a terrible cliche, and one that I've resisted for awhile, but I'm coming to realise it's true.Just type in any of these names in the Search bar in YouTube and it will list all the videos by these people.  Eckhart Tolle and Ajahn Brahm in particular speak on many different topics such as depression, happiness, loss, grief, etc.
