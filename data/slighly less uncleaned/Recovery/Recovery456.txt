  Happy at lastTrying tofind  the right words to express how what i'm feeling right now is so hard, but i will try my best. I feel as if i can take on anything right now, and not let anything, or anyone get me down. My whole body  feels warm and at peace right now, my emotions are calm , i'm not struggling to come out of the darkness that overwhelmed me for so long.I can honestly say that my depression  has been defeated, i won the tug of war over my very soul, if that makes any sense. Every day  i wake up, i feel more alive and happy, just so relieved to be here. I made a decision to step down from my managers position at work, and i know this was the best  decision i've ever made. My personal  life  is looking up,more accurately, it's rising from the ashes, lol. I just want everyone out there that there is hope, you can overcome the darkness and despair that threatens to overwhelm you I can honestly say, i am AloneandSad no more
