  Click and be amazed..For anyone of you who think that you're behind the ball  as in, you're not as good as other people because they can do this and that. This feeling typically occurs with people somewhat around your age, the feeling of not being able to do something someone else can is a common occurence which quite frankly bums some people out. The good news is that you can start anyday changing your life around, remember, since your here in this depression forum it is quite likely that if you take getting better seriously that you won't have too many problems down the road compared to other people who never seeked help. So I'm glad you guys are on here. Everyone has good things and bad things going for them, be honest with yourself on here, and that alone is a step forward to better health and only good things to come. Also, there are people waiting off in a distance in the future who need your support in the future as you will need theirs. Thanks, I hope you will all get out of your holes one day and help others, and one more thing... power to my peeps! Love to all.
