  RealizationsI came to a pretty major realization about myself this week. I can be friendly with everyone, but there are certain kinds of people that I just feel comfortable  around. The geeky weirdos, the ones that watch anime and cartoons and play roleplaying games and aren't trying to impress anyone, they're only interested in their geeky passions. I don't necessarily do all these things, but I'm one of them and honestly I've never felt comfortable around anyone else. And I know most people can be strange like that when you get to know them, but I prefer the kinds who are like that all the time.And it's okay not to want to hang out with everyone, especially the "cool kids". They may be impressive in their seeming normality, but for me that's so much more difficult to understand and feel comfortable around. I get that now. I feel so much less pressure. I feel pretty good.Anyone else come to some important realizations about themselves lately?
