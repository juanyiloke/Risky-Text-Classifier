Finding A Way To Smile AgainI have been dealing with my depression for a while now and it had gotten to the point where I needed medication just to act a bit human. My mother had remarried and we moved into an abusive household where everything was controlled and angry, and I turned to self injury as a way to cope and have a bit of control in my life. Now that we have moved out and are living on our own again, we are able to create new lives and become the happy people that we used to be. She has found her path, but I had a tough time finding mine. After living in a place like we used to for so long, I began to get used to it and with it gone, I was a bit lost. I knew that things were better, I just didn't know what to do. I started small and would lounge in pajamas on the weekend. I hadn't been able to do that in so long. It was nice. Eventually, I started gettitng involved in sports like I used to before all of this gunk happened. I started to find myself again and didn't have to turn to Seld Injury anymore. It wasn't until I started fencing that I was able to feel normal. At first I would be insecure and it was the encouragement of my coach that helped me open up. I started to feel happy at practice, and now I bring that feeling home. I used to Fence when I was younger, but stopped when things changed. Now that I have it again, I smile more. I feel like I found my niche, and that I am back to where I want to be. I still get depressed and sometimes the only time that I smile is when I am Fencing, but I see this as a stepping stone. I focus more, and my self esteem is slowly building up again. I love it. I know that I have a way to go until I am better, but being able to do something that I love is a how I am finding my reason to smile again. I smile more and I feel better.
