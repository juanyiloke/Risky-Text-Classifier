Finding HopeI am an Australian male living and working in Hong Kong. 3 years ago I suffered anxiety disorder with mild depression, treated with medication with some minor therapy for 6 months.I was well for the last 3 years, until recently I had a relapsed because of job change - but this time it's more depression but minor anxiety. I was feeling hopeless with this relapse, I went with the same above medication but it didn't work and psychiatrist changes it. The issue is I am dwelling / worry about this sickness, I still haven't accepted and depressive symptoms are more challenging.  It's like when things are so great for the last time..then "bam"....it returns.I like to hear from people around how do they cope this when it relapse and staying well.Thanks.
