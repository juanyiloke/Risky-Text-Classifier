  Finding your TRUE friends.hey everybody! i've not been on this forum in a while. i don't know if yous remember, but when i was active on this forum, i used to write A LOT about my friend  life  and how crappy it was. my "friends" excluded me so much this year. they left me out, they ignored me, and they basically cut me out their lives, for no reason. that was during school. i've now finished high school forever- and just before i finished, i started becoming good friends with another group of people. a lovely, genuine, down-to-earth group of people- who welcomed me with open arms! i didn't need to fight for any acceptance or approval. i now have finally realized that the first group of people were not my real friends- and i shouldn't of wasted my time on them. and now, i've a lovely new  group of friends, who are actually great people. they're not social-ladder climbers or anything like that. the boys in the group are also so nice- that they've actually changed my preferences on the opposite sex (i used to fall for dickheads, not anymore!)And the thing is, they were there, rightunder  my nose the whole time. i was just to busy trying to earn respect from the other group to notice. now i am so happy :) not in all aspects of life, but my friend life yes.So, i guess that i'm saying to people in this situation that your true friends will come around one day. and i really want everyone to find  their group of true friends, coz it's an amazing feeling <3
