I will be respectful towards those who are trying to help meDear Violet Diary, my day started strangely sluggish. It took me along time to wake up, by saying that I was awake but my body felt exhausted for no apparent reason. I dragged myself out of bed at around 8:30ish but I just felt tired, I laid thinking..Wtake up!I had a coffee with my two sisters who were nice for a change, no hip hop hooray but it was nice the tension was not in the air, I knew I had a lot to do so I tried to cope without taking any medication.I lasted until about 12ish then bang I was on fire, my family knew it because they see the change from myself not taking pills to taking pills.I went into productive mode & super cleaned the house,super cleaned myself & had my friend pick me up. I'm going to a mental health program  tomorrow for the first time & I don't know what or how I should feel, I'm going hungover, drunk anyway. I know that's not the appropriate way to induct myself but I don't care....I obviously will be respectful towards those who are trying to help me.
