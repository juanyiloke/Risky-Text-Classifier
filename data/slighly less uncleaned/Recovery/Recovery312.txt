It's been 17 weeks! **Triggers, suicide**Hi all. It's been 17 weeks since I started taking citalopram, and I have to say this drug has literally saved my life. Beforehand I was depressed and suicidal. Now, I haven't though about suicide for about 10 weeks and my depression has almost completely gone!I've had depression since I was 14 (I'm 18 now) and went through counselling for a few months but it just wasn't for me. I told everyone I felt better when I was still 14, and fast forward to 19 weeks ago: I had a complete breakdown, tried to kill myself and my mum found me. I went to hospital, got put on amitriptyline for two weeks which didn't work, then got put on the miracle that is 20mg of citalopram. I started a new sixth form in September and have been doing brilliantly, as opposed to last year where I failed half of my AS levels. Although my self confidence is still rock-bottom and I still have a few days where I feel like I'm going back to step one, my life has changed for the better and I only hope it continues to.One of the reasons why I feel the way I do today is because of all the kind people here on DWD. Even though I haven't been that active on here, I read a lot of the threads and they always make me feel better because of the kindness you all show. Thank you.Enough with the sob story! I'll let you all get on with your lives
