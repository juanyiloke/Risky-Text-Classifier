  Post 3 - The past has made me a better human being.________________________________________I went cold turkey off my medications. This was stupid & dangerous! The withdrawal symptoms frightened me to the point were I didn't want to be left alone. After about two weeks I went back to my family doctor. He was shocked at what I had done. He immediately put me back on depression medication & sedatives. When my father died, we went back for the funeral. I didn't want to go but my family doctor told me it was important. I had to handle what there was of his estate. It was a huge burden with a lot of legal paper work. My husband & I stayed in a hotel for a month. I could not face staying in the "family" home. It brought back "bad thoughts" - the mental/psychical/sexual abuse. In the end, I successfully lined everything up & we were able to return home. I was a mess! I'd gained 25lbs & my anxiety/panic attacks were an every day part of life. I did not want to leave the house. My family doctor provided support, partnered with medication. I had to start living again in baby steps. It took time, but I slowly got better. The family doctor reminded me that what had happened to me as a child was not my fault. I needed to hear this. Over the years I have needed to change my depression medication a couple of times, as it seemed to no longer work. Now I recognise when this is happening & seek help. For five years I have been on a once a day medication for depression. I rarely need medication for anxiety. My panic attacks are under control. I feel strong and healthy. I am able to help others on a daily basis. I am truly happy to be alive
