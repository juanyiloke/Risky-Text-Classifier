This...whole part of the forum is a joke....right? Positive feelings and motivational messages are bullshit. mere lip service when you are in the depths of your own hell. What words are going to pull me back up that I haven't tried telling myself already. When the fake wishes of well being and the only thing you are positive about is that you must die...what pretty painted from Gods lips to my ears words can you offer? Empty words of things will get better? I understand? Can you offer words of guarantee? Can you offer the words that will shut out all the shit in my head that has been there for years? Can you offer the words that will erase the pains of the past? Can your words do for me what the deluge of meds I take are supposed to be doing? What postive words can you offer that will remove the self inflicted scars that run from my elbow to my wrist on my arms? What have you got that can motivate me to live more than the motivation that the thoughts of suicide offer me? What in all honesty can you offer? Well, go on, spill them..... cat got your tongue?
