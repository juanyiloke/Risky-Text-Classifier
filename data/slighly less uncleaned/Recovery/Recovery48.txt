ChurchDo you go to one? Why, why not? How do you like it? I am not religious but I find the atmosphere very calming. It pulls you out of all the running around, chasing something, all the noise and stress. Makes you stop for a moment and realize that there is something more to life than just money, success and other people. Sometimes I wish I could be religious and go to church all the time, have that community for myself, read the Bible, pray. Unfortunately I've never been much of a believer. Camille Paglia has said numerous times that today art should take the place of religion (for the atheists obviously, not everyone) and I kind of get the same feeling as in a church when I go to large museums, exhibiting art from Renaissance till mid 20th century. For a while it declutters my mind and charges me.  What do you think about that?
