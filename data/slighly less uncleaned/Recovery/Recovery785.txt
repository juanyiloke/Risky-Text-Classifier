Feeling a Little Better, Achieved a Goal, hard work and focus.Hi there,just wanted to fill people in on what has been happening in my life, i have posted on here and replied to comments etc..but i had mad a decision that i wanted to change my life and i have past a waypoint in my journey, whilst not being where i want to be in my journey i am feeling good at the moment and really focused and have a good clarity about things.on sunday i rode my bike 100klms in the moretonbay100 cycle ride on brisbanes northside after focusing on getting back on my bike after disabiltiy and injury, simply put i am visualy impared have health issues and am going through some majour life changes at this time, with a long journey with depression and anxiety along for the ride.at the beginning of the year i joined the gym, started working towards goals and fundraised for charity and towards the two ride i wanted to do, on i have just done and on on 19th of october.i wrote to beyond blue earlier in the year and was talking about my goals and challenges, and asked if there where any stickers or tshirts available i could buy to wear on my training rides, hopeing to strike up conversations with people, two things happened, a lady at beyond blue sent me a tshirt and people started talking to me about why i was wearing the shirt and my story and experiences with depression and anxiety.. hopefully i have gotten through to some people and made a positive impact if only small..i would just like to say i am proud to be part of theese forums if sometimes it has been a little negative and one sided i apologie, but through changing my focus on things and with the help of people here and things i have read here, i am starting to see life diferently and feeling good about myself and the world at this moment in my life. take care peoples :)
