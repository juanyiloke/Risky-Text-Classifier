  success or how to cope________________________________________hi all  been awhile since I have been on here ,, so I thought I would share a few things with yall ,3 years ago I didn't care if I lived or died , every day was black , buried in ? deep dark sadness , loss of hope loss of feeling, deep grief , I didn't care, I was self destructive , I drank to oblivion every night , all I saw all I felt was despair.I slowed the drinking , that helped a lot .. but the darkness was still there.now I look back and wow what a mess I was .my life now is not free of that dark place -- but I find that it is not in me every hour of every day - just once in awhile .now the only meds I take are alprazolam for anxiety an a blood pressure med as 228 0ver 130 aint good now to thank the rock that saved me my granddaughter she is the best just the best I love you jellybean   and my soul saver nikiniki I love you  I thank all of you on this forum for your help , your shares , I feel for everyone , I felt your pain in your words , and it hurt to read , but at the same time it helped me to realize , there are others far worse off then me , and I had no way to help,...........now I was a seer , and lost it , now I see again some . and it gets stronger every day .. summer stay strong please , I love you , I feel you often  so thank you one and all I guess realizing that others hurt more then I was the self help , that changed the game for me ,I would give myself to help anyone , out of the dark place ...may you find guidance in your own life energy ,, peace and happiness to all rtb aka don964964I check in once in awhile ok
