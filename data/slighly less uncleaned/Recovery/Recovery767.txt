Getting the right diagnosisWhat has worked for me? Getting the right diagnosis for starters and this was only possible with regular therapy. I am in the living in the USA for several years with my family. My husband has health insurance included in his work package. I have access to monthly psychiatrist visits and weekly psychologist visits, all for minimal cost. So far I have been here for 12 months and my recovery is going well and I believe I have received a correct diagnosis after many, many years. I don't think I would have received a correct diagnosis in Australia (at least not for a very long time), not because of mental health professionals' lack of skill, but because  access to mental health care is in Australia is expensive so I couldn't afford intense therapy. In Australia, I'd visit my psychiatrist every 3 months, paying a gap of approx $65. That wasn't too bad. However, to see a psychologist on a regular basis was beyond my means. I would get a mental health plan every year which would entitle me to 6 visits with a psych. I could also get a little rebate with my health insurance provider in  after I had used up my mental health plan, but it was quite minimal. So seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, for a long period of time, was not possible as the psych I was seeing in Australia charges over $150 an hr. Had it not been for the intense therapy I have received over the last 12 months in the USA, I don't think I would have made such big strides towards recovery. I am not saying the USA system is better. Far from it. I am currently in a beneficial situation where I get healthcare almost for free. However when I return to Australia, I go back to paying my own health insurance with minimal mental health coverage. I am concerned that my mental health will go downhill. Anyway, I choose not to ruminate about this too much. Cheers,Wombat Divine
