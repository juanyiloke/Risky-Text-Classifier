  I've changed a lot...For the better.Tomorrow I turn 21 and I've been reflecting. It's pretty cool/weird to see how far I've come in life . The last about year I've discovered I'm not as unintelligent as a I thought, a bit pretty than I thought, and myfriends and family  are amazing. I've become more outgoing and made a ton of new friends, got back  in contact with old ones. I've discovered who I want to be. And I'm starting to care a lot less about what people think about me. I've had great everlasting memories. I graduated from high school top  10%. I joined the military but then was discharged not far after. Not sure if I want to go back. Now I'm in school and passing with High Bs and As. I just passed a very important licensing exam. I know I want to work  in the medical field. Yoga and running help make a worlds difference in my life too. Even though I'm injured right now.  My life is sort of taking a very positive direction . It's cool and weird. Epically remembering the point in life when I was really depressed and suicidal and had failed two high schools and cut off all my friends. It's like woah.
