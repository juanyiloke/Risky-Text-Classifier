doing okat the moment i doing ok i have not wanted to cut or od and im still taking my meds.i still in pain and still get pretty down and feel alone but i have been doing things to keep my mind off wanting to do stuff.i have been knitting and reading and watching charmed when i wanted to do bad stuff the only thing that i have not been doing is my college work. my doctor has giving me a sick note for 2 weeks so i can really gt on with it. i a good night sleep last night coz the doctor has put me on amitriptyline to help me sleep coz of the pain.really hope this is the start of better things and not the carm before the storm
