Something Finally Clicked, Hope For Me Yet!I hope this is the right place to post this but I had to share. Yesterday I had another hard day from dealing with my past and some random depression. I felt horrible to a point of leaving here for good. But I met this member on here and we started talking.  They gave me some good advice then something clicked for me, in my head. Not even my therapist got close of telling me what this member did.  And it really helped me and got a better understanding of myself and what happen to me growing up. That they can’t really hurt me and its so not worth it to dwell on it or let it bother me no more. (My thinking of it) So I really want to thank this member for speaking with me and helping me out. I’m not even scared no more of what all happen to me as a kid – teenage years. And I think I made progress of knowing what they told me and focusing on that to move on and forget it all.  So thank you so much for everything you’re an awesome person I hope we can become friends more and hope that all the struggles you deal with I can help out and hope they get better for you. I'm not sure if its ok to share there name but I'll PM them and let them know I wrote this and maybe let who ever replays to this know who they are. I respect there privacy.
