  Hey everyone!I don't know if this is in the right place and i'm sorry if it isnt (it's all a bit confusing but i'm sure i'll get used to it).I just wanted to post as it's nice to feel that there's people out there reading this and sharing the same stuff as me. Anyway, I have actually had quite a good day today and just thought I should share this as they don't come along too often. 2 days ago, I couldnt get out of bed and wanted to end everything and now i'm here feeling slightly ok - what would I have done to my family if I had gone through with anything? That was quite an eye opener for me and I will hang on to this feeling for a while. My lovely boyfriend says that when the dark  days come along just curl up tight in a ball until they go away because they will eventually go away - and he's right.Love to everyone and I hope everyone is ok xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
