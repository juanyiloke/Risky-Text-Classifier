  FutureMe.orgFutureMe is a website where you type a letter to yourself, then set a date a year or few later for it to be emailed to you. I just got mine. I wrote it in the sense that certain 2012 goals would be completed. Some of those goals were achieved. And I reminded myself of a certain 2012 goal that I did complete at the time of writing.__________________"Thank you for sharing, Monkey.
