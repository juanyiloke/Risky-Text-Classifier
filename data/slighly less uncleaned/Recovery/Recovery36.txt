How Do I Get Into The Habit Of Doing Something All The Time To **** Depression?If there's one thing I learned about depression over the years, it thrives on inaction. In order to combat this you must keep busy. There is a simple psychological principle: You simply cannot think of two different things at once.  It is easier said than done. Whenever I take action, I find it difficult to keep on going because my brain is full of all this negative intrusive thoughts. Like many depression sufferers I have no energy and I am always fatigued or exhausted. The quality of sleep is poor and you cannot relax or rest comfortably. Also, I find it difficult to concentrate and make decisions .I am often absent minded and my memory is not sharp. There are so many depression related factors that all lead to poor performance in life. Depression is a vicious cycle. Inaction worsens depression and action breaks the cycle of depression. Your life eventually becomes a composite of all the habits you form. Depression cannot succeed in destroying your life if you can "crowd it out of your mind". I notice that I tend to surf on the internet the whole day when I am depressed. This is something I really need to learn to stop. I "think" I am coping with depression by using the internet because it feels relaxing and I think I am gettng more information to solve my problems. In reality, nothing is happening because no action is being taken. The Internet becomes my "quick fix" for depression.  I really need to keep moving forward and be busy. When I am depressed, I lack energy. So how do I get into the habit of always being busy when you are exhausted and have no energy?
