Staying Vocal Is A Key. Where's The Keyhole, Though?I'm 41, just re-enrolled in college (it's been 20 years!). I prescribe 5, 5k runs per week to feed my Endorphin addiction (in the past it's what's kept me sane). I use a blue light, daily, to fend off SADS. I also take Vit D & eat very little junk. So I'm doing EVERYTHING I know to do to keep well; stay busy, be surrounded with loving, caring friends, and use light therapy, but this time it's just not enough! I feel like I'm in a void.Since late October (2013) I got switched from Wellbutrin to Lexapro and then to Prozac. But, I've been on Prozac for 2weeks and all the improvement I got from the Lexapro is gone (with Lex I was having night terrors, twitching, and skin crawling ...not to mention anorgasmia). I have visited my first, ever, therapist 2ce now. My last visit he told me to allow myself to feel my anger and unforgiveness: feel them because I own them. I felt very released afterward. Very! But, 3 days post & I still can't stop feeling them! I don't want to own them!!! They seem to own me.I've been in my bed for 20 hours, now, not wanting to become a sourpuss in the living area with my family. I am so very sad. So very broken feeling. Wishing I could catch some secret agent powder that just disintegrates me, poof!I know I have many blessings. That just nails the coffin down a little tighter, slathers guilt all over me, not enjoying my blessings.I feel like taking more Prozac. Maybe that could help. But dr prescribed 10mg, and I'll need to ask her to up it. I'm the same, if not worse, than I was when I began taking antidepressants.Can you offer tips that keep your head above the waves? I'll try anything!
