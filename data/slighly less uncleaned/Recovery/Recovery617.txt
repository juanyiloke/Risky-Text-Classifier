  Psych AppointmentWell on Friday ( which is also the general election day here in Ireland thats going to go down in History ), I have my psych appointment, and have a feeling that it's going to be my last. Bringing the mother with me so the psych can explain to her what happened to me in theSummer months  and why I went the way I did. I still don't really know what happened. The last time I saw her she said that I was going through a "Major Depressive Episode" and with the pills  she highly doubts I go through another one and that I don't need CBT or anything like that. I join a support group but only went a few times because I felt I didn't really need it, although I did make a few friends :) I feel like my life  has gotten so much better. The fact that I'm living at home , not in college and don't have enough to go out every weekend with my friends, I stillfeel happy . I got back  in contact with old school friends today and it felt great . The last time I saw them I was going through the episode and I really wasn't in the right mind state for socializing so they thought that I had a problem  with them and choose to avoid me. But we had a great chat today and they understood why I was reacting to them like that. One of them is actually going through a rough patch at the moment, and it's great being in the mind set to be there and help her when she needs to talk. So hopefully this Friday I be discharged from the psych. My only worry is that she'll take me off the tablets. I'm not afraid of having a relapse, just afraid of what way I'm going to react sleep wise. The pills I'm on ( Mirtazapine) Really helped me with sleep, so I'm going to ask her to give me a few sleeping pills just for the first few days of going off the tablets. Wish me luck
