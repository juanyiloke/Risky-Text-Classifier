Abundance Dreams?I'm interested in what this means, psychologically.  Anyone do dream interpretation? I'm struggling financially…  but I keep having these wonderful mystical dreams where I find coins (gold and silver, sometimes as large as a dinner plate).  Usually either lying on the sidewalk or buried in sand or soil (I see the glint and uncover them). Then last night I came across a treasure of jewels and memorabilia from my ancestors (I should add that no such thing exists).  Included with the rest were some rings (including my wedding ring) that were stolen from me last year.  It was great to see them again. These dreams make me feel unusually peaceful when I awake.  For me they seem to represent creative and spiritual abundance as much as literal abundance.
