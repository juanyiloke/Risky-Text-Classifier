social networking and depression/anxietyI am interested how people with depression and anxiety deal with social networking sites like Facebook. I have Bipolar II and am also Asperger's. I am worried people I am friends with block my statuses and tags which makes me over-analyse the situation and not know where I stand with them, especially when they are sometimes stand-offish with me face to face even though they know about my condition and know I am trying to improve myself with exercise etc. I have deliberately started posting less because when I don't get likes from people I want to get likes from, I start thinking they are snubbing me or are sick of me and have blocked my statuses. Sorry if this seems whiny or self-pitying but I am prone to analyse the smallest detail to the nth degree. If I brought this up in a conversation it would seem petty or ridiculous but this stuff unfortunately really gets in my head and I am interested if anyone else worries they might have alienated other people (not deliberately) and that perceived snubbing on social networks needlessly increases anxiety and depression.
