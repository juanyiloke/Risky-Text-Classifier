  A new day; a new page...I look at life like it's a giant book. Every day produces a brand-new page. If I don't like my character; I can alter it to my liking, and I can edit out the errors along the way. When I wake up its a new beginning. What kind of adventure will I experience today? What lesson will unfold before me? What new thing can I discover about myself or about others?Looking at life this way helps me forgive mistakes either made by myself or others toward me. It definitely; opens the door to learning and accepting. It also motivates me to do something new. After all; I am the main character of my story, and I want to experience what life has to offer.Every day is a new page, and I will work towards making it a better experience than the day before. Will you join me?
