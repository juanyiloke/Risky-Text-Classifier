What is on your Bucket List?From the movie of the same name, a bucket list became the list of things one wants to do before s/he kicks the bucket (so to say)...I thought it would be interesting to see what others have on their lists;Mine is as follows in no order of importance:1. go to Thailand2. meet several cyber friends in person3. meet HH The Dali Lama4. do a duet with a dear friend of mine (her idea which she shared several nights ago)5. help this friend prepare to audition for The Voice (wish I could do it myself, but my body would not hold up)6. finally get my guitar playing to not sound like ducks in heat7. finish and have published my book of poetry, and a children's book that I have yet to start8. finish a diagnostic tool that I have started a few months ago9. start working in watercolors again10. finish my Masters Degree in IT management (only a few credits so far)11. get as far as possible on my Six Sigma certification Hoping all of you get many things on your list done!
