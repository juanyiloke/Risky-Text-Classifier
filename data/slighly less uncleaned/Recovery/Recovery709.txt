Adherence / Compliance -- How do you make yourself do the things that make you feel better?Hi Everyone,One of my biggest challenges with depression is doing the things I know make me feel better and make a positive difference to my emotional state. Especially when I'm feeling my worst, these things would make me feel better but I can't make myself do them because depression just kills all motivation.Just hoping to draw on the collective experience here. What kind of things do you to help make yourself do the things that make you feel better? Cheers,Zailleh
