Body Image.I have recently started to accept the way I look and starting to feel comfortable in my own skin. But today, I found an amazing series of photography, (which I cannot share due to nudity) However the message behind the pictures is quite powerful and I would like to share it here with you all.Illusions of the BodyThis series was made to tackle the supposed norms of what we think our bodies are supposed to look like. Most of us realize that the media displays only the prettiest photos of people, yet we compare ourselves to those images. We never get to see those photos juxtaposed against a picture of that same person looking unflattering. That contrast would help a lot of body image issues we as a culture have.Imagery in the media is an illusion built upon lighting, angles & photoshop. People can look extremely attractive under the right circumstances & two seconds later transform into something completely different.Within the series I tried to get a range of body types, ethnicities & genders to show how everyone is a different shape & size; there is no “normal”. Each photo was taken with the same lighting & the same angle.Celebrate your shapes, sizes & the odd contortions your body can get itself into. The human body is a weird & beautiful thing.I am willing should it be allowed to share the original photography to the people who wish to see it. I feel it holds a powerful message and I am glad to have come accross it.
