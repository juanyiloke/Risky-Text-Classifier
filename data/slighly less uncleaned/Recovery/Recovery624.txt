  not scared anymoreSince I have been suffering withdepression  going out has been an issue.Sometimes I wouldn't go out for 3-4 weeks. I hated being around people, that side has changed. If I need to go out now, its not an issue. These past few weeks I've been on about 20 trains. I feel a little more eased about getting out.Its just being out, sometimes I panic and think something is gonna happen to me. Mostly at night, when I see men with hoods up etc.. my brain  will runn wild.So I'm getting better in the aspect, just now I have to over come my panic attacks . For some reason they get worse at night time, I hate being alone with just me and a tv. If something that I don't like comes on it can make things worse. Its the most horrible feeling in the world "fear" :( .Death is one of the fears that runs through my brain most of the time, I just want it to leave me alone.I'm trying to get out and around a bit more, I'm joining the gym this week. Hopefully the excercise will help my depression a bit more. I need some more hobbies too. Maybe yoga?
