Change The Way We Do Or ThinkI have been trying to not worry.  I live with a man who can get me worried or stressed all the time with his big ideas.  Also situations can get me worrying a lot.  Then I remembered how things change always.  They never remain the same, not ever. So I started purposely not worrying.  I say to myself okay this is crazy right now but I am going to just wait it out.  Sooner or later it will be over or it will change.  Things always do.  I was able to do that and not get myself all worried and anxious.  I said to myself okay this is how this is right now, but it wont always be.  It was hard at first.  I made myself not react or get emotional, just kind of ignored it.  Sure enough the incident was over and done with and no longer a big huge Todo.  I am going to keep doing that and try to get in the habit.  Just dont react to things when they are stressful.  Especially when it is other people.  I dont have to get involved so I wont.  Anyway, it worked!!  Hope I can keep doing that! If you have other ways of doing things or thinking than you did before that made things better for you, I would like to hear them.
