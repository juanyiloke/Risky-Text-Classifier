  I'm not as depressed.I think I'm alittle happier now and not asdepressed as I was when I first joined the forum. I know I have to be careful and I know I'll always be vulnerable but it's so nice to be at peace, content, funcitonal. Just feeling alittle better in general lately. So Cool! Hope this new  feeling stays with me for awhile. I think some of it is due to my new friend  "w". Just nice to have someone around. Even if I never saw him again, I think his presence has helped me out so much. He doesn't spend much time with me. Just once in awhile calls, once in awhile he stops by. It makes me happy to have someone around. Just happy right now but I know this is a life  long battle for me. Just on the upswing now. Thank Goodness  I'M BACK! In my new place so happy.Hey Guys! I'm back , had a wonderful move. I'm in my new apartment. Just got my internet, tv and phone hooked up last night. So friggin happy right now. Such a great move. I feel I have a new life . I love my new place and glad to have gotten out of that house of mine. (or my prison as I liked to call it) Everything justfeels good . Where I moved to is within 10 blocks of 3 of my friends. Well, my friend  and his 2 cousins. I have one young guy that takes me on bike rides on the bike trails. So nice and peaceful and the exercise  is good for me and the trails are so close to my apartment. Wow~ All of them come and visit me all the time now. I have friends now. I also have grocery stores and fast  food places close to my apartment. I'm finding my way around here and it's good. Just feel so-o happy. This has been a great move for me. Things are looking up for me... for the first time in along  time. So-o happy. I have peace and happiness for the first time in a long time. Just hopeful.
