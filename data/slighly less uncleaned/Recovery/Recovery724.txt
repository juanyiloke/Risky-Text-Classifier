Short term strategiesOk, it's been nearly six months since being discharged from hospital, and I'm still recovering from my depression.  I must admit that since then the bottle has been a comforter but I'm really trying to stay off that by focusing on other, positive stuff and coming up with short term strategies for those times when I find my headspace getting overwhelmed like the proverbial tornado it becomes (and when it's raining!).  I want to share two of them with you all:The first is the TV show "Too Cute" on Animal Planet, which shows puppies and kittens from 0-8 weeks and their antics. The other is standing out in the rain of a summer afternoon and breathing in the air (providing it's safe and you're not risking getting struck by lightning!).Any other ideas?
