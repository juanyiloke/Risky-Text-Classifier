  The right meds can make a world of difference________________________________________Have battled depression & other issues for over 30 years now. My first experience with psych meds was with tricyclic antidepressants - and I became suicidal while on them. That kind of turned me "off" of trying more. Years later I developed anxiety / panic attacks, and was put on Xanax. Found that it worked GREAT for chilling me out when those hit....but the depression remained. Worsened when life was rough, of course, but even in good times, was there.Knowing I had a problem with low serotonin, tried St. Johns Wart, no improvement. Years later tried Magnesium, and could see an improvement myself, as could others around me. Still, not a great improvement. Life turned hard again, and I found myself sunk in depths again.I finally broke down and went back to a doc. She put me on Celexa. WOW. By day TWO I was feeling better than I had in YEARS. Now granted, I've only been on it 5 days so far.....but these past four days have been simply wonderful. I've got energy, I feel relaxed, I feel refreshed after sleeping - can't even remember the last time I could say that! Don't be a fool like me. Don't waste years of your life suffering. Try meds, and keep trying different ones.....because finding the right one could make all the difference. Not a single other thing in my life has changed / improved....but I'm not suffering from it any more.
