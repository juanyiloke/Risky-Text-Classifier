something that worked for me..I have been suffering from depression for 7 years, its been a long and very hard journey for me. For the past 7 years, I have been searching for something that could cure me, I mean it was the thing that kept me going, HOPE. And so I tried so many different 'possible cures', from medications, hypnosis, supplements, counselling, and a bunch of other things, but nothing really worked.  About 6 months ago, I tried this thing called 'foot detox', many say there are many health benefits I could get from it so I gave it a go. And to my amazement, I started to feel better after the first treatment, so i came back again to have more treatments and I could feel continuous health benefits from it. After that I bought my own machine which cost $100 from ebay and have been feeling better than ever. I finally getting out from depression and I am so excited about it !! but my question is, how does this machine help me from getting out of depression?Im searching for an answer, this machine works by transferring positive and negative ions in and out of my body, which eliminates the body waste and improves health, But personally I dont think I got better from depression because I got rid of the body waste. But rather its because the positive and negative ions that charges ur body (and brain).. i believe brain is like a battery, which is the source of power for the body. When u have a negative experience/ trauma, ur brain malfunctions and it causes depression. I think some parts of ur brain stop functioning and by transferring the positive and negative ions into ur body, the machine helps to stimulate ur brain cells and so it could work normally again.What I really want to know iss, has anyone else received benefits from this treatment? or will anyone willingly try this and tell me how they feel about it? I have been suffering from depression for a long time, and I hope that I can help people by sharing my experience. Cheers !
