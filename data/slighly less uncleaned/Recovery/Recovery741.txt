Weight IssueHi, I have been diagnosed with depression since 2006. There has been good times in that period. When i am on my medication i can live a normal life. This last year i tried again to reduce the medication because i have weight issues. It put me in hospital. I was angry for a long time after because i can't help the weight. I am asking the beyond blue community how you dealt with the weight gain? Is there some way around it? I go to gym 3 to 4 times a week. I walk my dog every day. Please help me
