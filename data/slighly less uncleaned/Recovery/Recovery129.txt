I Think It's Time I Slow Down...Hello everyone,I'm not quite sure if this is the right section for the question i'm about to ask, so if it's not, i'm sorry.  I'm in my second year of school " major in psychology", and i'm doing very well at school even a little "too well", meaning i push myself too hard to meet up to everyone's expectations and my own, and since i'm a perfectionist meeting up to my own expectations is impossible no matter how hard i try. I was diagnosed seven years ago with MDD, ADD and GAD after a suicide attempt and i have been on meds and psychotherapy on and off ever since, and every time school stress gets to me my depression gets worse " suicidal thoughts, self medicating... etc".I just don't think it's worth it anymore, so I have decided it's time i take life slowly and one step at a time, taking less courses each semester means it will take longer to graduate which i'm fine with, but when I asked my friends and family for advice they all said "it's stupid and all students suffer from school stress and it shouldn't be an excuse to be lazy".but i'm NOT like all other students ! i have mental problems. what do you guys think ? am i making any sense here ? should i just keep pushing myself and maybe this would make me stronger ? any suggestions and thoughts would be truly appreciated.
