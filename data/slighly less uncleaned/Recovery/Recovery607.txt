  A journey: My life as of recentlyI am only 15. Im usually very articulate with my writing, probably because im a bit of a bookworm and forum stalker. I come on here to help people but don't post much about myself.Well, I'm changing that today. Ill  just throw these out there, feel free to post whatever kind of comment you want belowI got into paintball recently, For me theres nothing like going out  at 9 and signing into the field and watch as all your competitors (Can't say friends, I have a few... Not groups) Gather for a game and then cart off to one of your favorite  fields for a gamefull  of strategy, accuracy, and timing. Something refreshing that makes the world melt away.I also started playing acoustic, just another something to do in my spare time. I like making the notes ring in my room. Although, no one knows I play except for my best friend and girlfriend. I don't tend to brag about much.Writing would be great, but i can't seem to make time for it and no one ever reads my books or short  stories anyway. If someone would like, ill post them on here to read.I've been through quite a lot... As of right now I am worried about my girlfriend being pregnant. I know this is very irresponsible and i do regret my decision and will not make the mistake twice. We were safe, and she had just gotten off her period so the possibility is very low, but it is very nerve racking. Some support would be very nice.Im going balling this Saturday from 9-6 plus nightball (7-10 in a lit stadium0 so I plan on telling you guys about thatI put this under  this category because these are the things that make mefeel better . My life  has improved over the last few months all because I was a little adventurous and in some cases just outright sideways about my life.
