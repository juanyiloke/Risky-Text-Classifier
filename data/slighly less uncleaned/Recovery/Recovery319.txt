Phobias we have overcomeI was just having a think about phobias that I've had in the past that I have overcome, maybe to offer a bit of hope to those with phobias that they CAN be fully beaten.So, here is mine. I used to be terrified of batteries! I couldn't touch them, I was actually scared of finding them in drawers, and at Christmas all the battery adverts had me shuddering and hiding behind a cushion.The other day I got a message on my TV saying ' the batteries in your remote are flat' so I opened the back and turned them around a bit to get them working again, something that a few years ago I couldn't even have considered.I still think batteries are ugly and I am not keen on finding old ones in drawers, but I basically overcame my fear.Has anyone else got any positive stories of overcoming phobias.....?
