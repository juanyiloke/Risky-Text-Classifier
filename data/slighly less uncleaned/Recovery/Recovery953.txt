Feeling good now!! Is that allowed??? LOLFigured out with a little help, how to get my septic tank working again.. Knock on wood!!?Got my backup iPad loaded with all my music and apps and is working ok.. Knock on wood againTook my blood pressure couple of days , just cause I had a suspicion??? All three were almost 20 points higher than usual.. No wonder I was feeling sort of not ok..thought and came tome that just possibly this might be due to the Prilosec anti heartburn med that doc Elisabeth put me on starting 3 weeks ago..stopped taking it couple days ago and all 3 readings have dropped 15 points already..Will message Eli today and tell..love this galIs. Almost 6am here and Zoomies is still sleeping.. Going to check in a minute to verify still breathing..then we going to have coffee together to some bob Seeger and silver bullet band music..Up loud!!!Darn it.. Am having a good day..knock loudly on the wood.......
