Working OutI know that exercise tends to help keep our body chemistry in balance but when I'm not feeling great about myself or my situation I tend to get hit or miss with it. I love to run outdoors, hitting trails and roads but I'm limited both by not being about to run distance outside where I am (it's not safe) as well as a knee injury. I also like to lift in the gym. The problem isn't the distance to the gym or lack of weights, it's motivation. I know what I need to do and should do but some days I just can't make myself do it.Eat healthy, exercise, eat carbs moderately and drink moderately. Easy to say but some days, tough to do.
