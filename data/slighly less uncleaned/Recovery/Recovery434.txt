  I've been invited to an Awards Ceremony!I recently received a letter from my high school. It said that me and my family have been invited to an awards assembly ceremony for Sophomores.If you want to get an idea  of what kind of academics I'm involved in, I'm taking max # of credits, advanced  classes , and I was on the Principal's Roll (3.75-4.0+) once and the Honors Roll (3.5-3.74) twice this year so far.so yeah xDmy dad  is buying me my first suit and tie for it  I NOW Have A Business or, How Far I Have ComeWhen I thank back to when I first found this site, I didnt want to live. I thought that I wasmonster . And the only feelings I could trust was pain and sorrow. It has been a struggle from time to time since. But while I havent made a buck yet, I know I will and that it is only a matter of time. And for a person with severe depression to take the time and build a site and actually sell things on it...yes I think I have improved, mentally speaking of course. And the best  part  is that not only do I have a chance to make some much needed moolah, but I will be helping people at the same time!I would post the link here, but I dont want to be accused of spamming the board.I just had to share  this with you guys!!
