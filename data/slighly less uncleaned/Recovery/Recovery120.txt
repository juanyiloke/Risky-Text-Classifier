Why Posting To "one Step At A Time" Helps Me.Posting things I'm thankful for, things that went right, goals for day/week, and other things here has helped me as much as posting in the other groups. By focusing (even momentarily) on things I'm grateful for, or on goals, or things that went right instead of wrong, it takes my focus away from the negative aspects of daily living. Some days I have to really stretch to come up with things to list, but when you really think about it, there seems to always be things, they just may be hard to see when there is chaos all around.
