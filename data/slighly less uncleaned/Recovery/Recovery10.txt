Nothing Is PermanentI've been keeping this as a mantra lately for my really really bad days with depression and anxiety. The idea that nothing is permanent can be scary (especially with anxiety) but I can turn it around in my favor to help myself out. The idea that "nothing is permanent" can apply to my bad days and bad situations. None of them are permanent and there are better days and better things that will come to me eventually. It also applies to my depression and anxiety directly in hopes that one day I will move past them completely :) What do you guys think?
