Your Longterm-Goal And How To Get There.I suppose that most of us have full recovery, or living with ones disorder(-s) as best as possible if full recovery is not expected, as our MAIN-GOAL.To reach this main aim, it might be necessary to set one or more longtime-goals (goals that need planning ahead step by step). My thoughts are that this thread shall be of help to chose at least one longterm-goal at the time and to figure out how to get there step by step and to have the support of other DF-members.1) Name the longterm-goal you are working for at the time being.2) Write down what small steps you have to take to reach it.3) Come here now and then and share with us how you are doing.Let us all be supportive!
