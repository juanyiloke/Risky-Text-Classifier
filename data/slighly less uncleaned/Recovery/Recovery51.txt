Useful Apps?I have an ipod touch and google chrome myself but here is what I like to use to make my day easier.  Does anyone have any good apps to share?1. SoundGecko:This app/website will read aloud articles on the web so you can listen to it instead of reading it yourself.  I have a lot of trouble reading (even post from this forum) and this app will read it for me.  2. Lift:I use this app for habit and goal setting.  Like brushing my teeth, washing my face, reading everyday, etc.   You can make your own goals or join in with others to reach the same goal.  Some very inspiring stories on there.3. Spending:A simple simple app to keep track of my money.  Everytime I spend money I'll type it in here and I can see how much I have left.4.  Seven:An exercise app that runs a 7 minute workout.  It's a bit stressful since it takes away "hearts" when you miss a work out but I try not to pay attention to it.  Plus you can always restart a new session.5.  Mindfullness:A meditation app that have guided and non guided 3-20 min meditations.  Not bad.  Great on the subway.  I think there is another one of these with more meditation options though. 6.  TEDA great app for educational talks.  For people into that sort of thing.7. DuolingoA great app for leaning another language (free).  For people into that sort of thing.8. OverdriveMy public library is connected this this app which lets me borrow audiobooks via this app.  Audible does the same thing for a fee.
