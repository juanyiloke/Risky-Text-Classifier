An Observation I've Made About Depression/anxietyIt seems my speel chequer is not working, so I appologise in advance. One simple thing I've noticed about depression: Challanging a negative thought/feeling/belief seems to be the best way to help depression/anxiety, thinking too much doesn't seem to help. I never had much success with trying to think through things, and the most progress seemed to come when I eventually gave in and actually tried to do things in a planned way, even though they were the most emotionally draining options, despite not really feeling motivated. The success and even the failures, afterwards made me question the idea that I was hopeless at certain things and additionally I got a little boost from doing *anything* other than moping about. Probably what I am saying is obvious, but it's really hard to motivate oneself when feeling low and/or scared. Gonna sound stupid, but I found that when I want to do something nerve wracking, that faking motivation and confidence really does seem to work, because the success afterwards is like a small suprise that generates real confidence. Usually people are telling us the answers however our own emotions prevent us being able to accept them.
