Anywhere I Hang My Hat Is HomeI had a rough day and was so very tired when I came home...I dutifully came here to make sure I took care of what I needed to...as I read the gracious and the caring threads here, I was reminded how blessed I am to be a part of this wonderful community...my 'blues' were lifted and I feel so much fuller now...thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making me a better person because I am in your companyPlease treat yourself with the kindness so many of you afford me and know that each of you deserve your own caring and the caring of others.
