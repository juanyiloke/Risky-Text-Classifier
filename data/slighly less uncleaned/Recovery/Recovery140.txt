Had A Great BirthdaySo today was my 21st birthday and I'm glad to say I had a good day. I got alot of birthday wishes from friends and family even some people I don't know too well. My grandma took me out to lunch and I got a free cupcake lol. Worked a short shift and made some money in tips, celebrated with my family and got a gift, then to top off the night the night won a poker game with a few friends. So overall had a wonderful day and I feel pretty happy for the first time in awhile being able to connect with others and have good time.
