Succes And Then The Black Hole Came By...Hello everybody,I'm new to the forum but I guess I needed someone to share my story with. I'm soon to be 28, just finished my second year of med school, wich I got in after years of leading a totally different life, being a social worker and then a manager within the social working area. I got married one year and two months ago.It was what I'd wanted, what I'd worked for, what I'd dreamed of and the bang! All of a sudden things starting moving too fast all around me, study hours became too long, tasks became too demanding, relationships too complicated or just a lonely place to be.The funny thing is that nothing really changed. All of a sudden I started not being able to do it anymore.
