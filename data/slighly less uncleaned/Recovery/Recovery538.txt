  a solution foundAfter a hard session with my therapist I have decided to move to another county. My post traumatic stress disorder is not getting better because of this area. Mostly nothing but things have happened to me since I have lived in the area of Michigan that I have since I was born. I am going to get the credit cards all at zero and then move I hope to do this by may of 2015. I am sick of wanting to do self destructive things or harm to myself cause of triggers. I am going to use the 3 weeks off I have to go and explore the new area and see how it goes. I am looking for apartments and I need to make sure they take cats.  My Therapist is wanting me to move to a town she lived in which was where people are nice and open minded not jerks. I am looking forward to not feeling paranoid when I go places or what people are going to use against me.  so proudI am off for 3 weeks from work and am planning on losing about 10 to 30 pounds. I have been working on learning some new tunes and have almost got Metalica's Seek and Destroy under my fingers which makes me happy due to never hearing any encouragement for decades. I had to get my unemployment all set up yesterday and I was happy that today it going in the right account.    I was so happy that I beat the fear's and worries. I got 2 things to sign and take care of from my tax man  and took care of that. I am just happy at 33 I am having the confidence to do things without fear. I remember trying to cook and my Mom was laughing at me and she said "I cant help it it's funny" or her and my brother both laughing at me when I would try and do things. When I do things and it goes awesome I want to throw a Parade. I am pumped to workout later and hit an AA meeting too.
