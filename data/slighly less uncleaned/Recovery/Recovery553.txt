  Things are finally starting to turn aroundSo after a year of shear bad luck, letdowns, and bad news, things are finally starting to go a lot better for me. :)I moved to the city at the start of this month, so I gained a lot of independance as well as a more interesting life ... I started some post-university studies  that I think I'm going to really enjoy... I'm starting to become more social and meet a lot of new people and make friends... and I seem to have found a job  as well.   It might just be a few hours a week, but today was my first day and it went really well... so it's something I enjoy and something that is actually somewhat relevant to my futurecareer .After how badly last year went for me, this is a really nice change!
