The painful truthSo it's been a few weeks since me and my bf split up. But after so much confusion I finally learnt what he's been up to for the last 6 months/ since we got together. He really was leading me on in the sense that he is narcissistic. He never wanted a romantic relationship with me even though he made it look like he did at first. He's been using his friends death as a cover up to see me less cos of depression as i know that is not normal. And the reason he doesn't want help is cos he knows full well what he is. It could be NPD or he's just narcissistic in general.But since learning this, it's made it easier for me to break free from him and I have been in a similar position before, but with a male Friend, but we were just friends. And the creepy thing was, my ex was starting to dress like this guy, which really worried me.I'm no longer depressed or anxious, but I am run down with a cold though, which I'd rather have.Had lots of support from friends, getting out a lot and doing something for myself soon.
