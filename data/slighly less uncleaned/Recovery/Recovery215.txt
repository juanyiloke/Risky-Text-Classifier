  Depression will always be a part of me________________________________________Having grown up in a dysfunctional family with a cold mother and abusive brother, I became depressed from the age of 12 and self-harmed in a variety of ways: cutting, hitting and strangling myself. My mother disliked my crooked smile and brought me to a dentist who ground away my front teeth and placed poorly made crowns on top of them. The work was done with the purpose of providing a cosmetic fix. It was both unnecessary and traumatic, and I grew to hate myself even more and never smiled at anyone after that.I entered a relationship when I was 18. For 7 years I clung onto the hope that my boyfriend would someday propose and we would live together and I would no longer have to live with my family. I couldn't afford to move out on my own. To my disappointment, he never did propose or have any intention of getting married. I had invested so many years in a relationship that headed nowhere. I was still studying full-time and couldn't afford to move away from my family. My teeth that were damaged as a child were causing me pain and were going to cost $20,000 fix. Having accepted that I was never going to find peace, I calmly walked into nearby bushland, removed the strap from my bag, tied it to a tree branch and hung myself.The rope I used snapped while I was unconscious, and I woke up convulsing on the ground. My time in hospital was strange. I was grateful I survived with only mild brain damage, but at the same time I was disappointed I was still here. The next few months were difficult but eventful. I got some financial support from the government to help me move out, and I broke up with my boyfriend. I dragged myself to therapy and returned to full-time study.It has been just over a year since all that happened, and my relationship with my family has improved. My mother realises that she needs to treat me with respect if she wants to see me, and having my own place gives me some much needed space away from her. I've obtained a payment plan where I can pay for my dental work in installments which is a great relief.Even though many things have improved since my suicide attempt, to get to this point hasn't been easy at all. I still feel pretty down at times and I can't say I've overcome the depression completely. I believe it will always be there, and my job is to know how to manage it through looking after myself (eating well, getting some exercise) and knowing when to enlist professional help. So far, so good.
