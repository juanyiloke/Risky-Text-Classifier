Home cats??When I first read the title of this forum I missed the point of it completely. I took it to mean 'run straight home and don't talk to anyone on the way!! I have read the title several times to realise that it is a forum for people who believe that they are on the home straights. They have gained insight into their illness and believe they are well on the way to recovery. Home for most people is a place where they can feel secure and be themselves. I have been on the home straights many times and feel that I have beaten this dreadful illness. I'm a lot more wary these days and value my sanity and positive times. My son when he was very young when were on a boat in Norfolk must have been feeling insecure and unsafe.He wanted to go back to the place where he felt secure hence 'home cats' He knew at such a young age that was where he wanted to be - where he could feel safe again. Mental illness has left me feeling insecure and vulnerable and I have wanted to go back to my physical and spiritual home too.
