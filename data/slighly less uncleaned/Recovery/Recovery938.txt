Don't be afraid of feeling anxious or nervous.Change and unfamiliarity can be scary. It can make you feel really anxious and nervous, and although this feels bad, it can be mean some really good signs.Firstly you are usually nervous when you are interacting or doing something that you really want to do, such as a business interview or meeting somebody you really want to feel appreciated by. You're worried about failing, and that builds up a strong anxiety - however you really want it so you in truth nervousness is uncontrolled excitement. Just realise that you can achieve what you want, and your nerves and anxiety will change to excitement, and you can be happy doing anything you want.Secondly being nervous is sign that you feel like you're in unfamiliarity. This is important because it signifies that the body and mind is having to adapt and change. You need new experiences. They inspire something very deep down inside of you and allow you evolve at the deepest level. Without change or unfamiliarity, the mind doesn't learn to adapt, and that something deep inside of us seldom awakens.So sometimes, even if scares you, charge in and do what you really want to do if it is safe and beneficial to you and/or to somebody special. It will be worth it because you're worth it.
