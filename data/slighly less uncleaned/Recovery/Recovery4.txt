I Had Depression, Now I Don't And Im Really Happy To Share The Mindsets That Hhelped Me.I suffered from depression in the past and some very nice people have given me pieces of wisdom that helped me fight it. and so now i would like to share them! i really dont gain anything by sharing these, except a sense of satisfaction from helping others with the only thing i have . I do a podcast where i share all the principles mindsets and philosophies with the goal of helping people out there. I'm gonna leave the notes of my podcast and a link here, so that if it seems like your into it you can check it out and maybe benefit. here are the notes for the podcast: Conforming to society standards of "beauty" is not the way to achieve self love/ Victim mentality on why your sad, or have low self esteem does not help you, it hurts your self esteem actually/ your identity isn't helping you either identities usually only limit who you are, its awesome to stay open to everything/ Don't let peoples opinions or validation affect your opinion of yourself, get your identity from yourself, not from what other people tell you/ how you stop seeking other peoples approval
