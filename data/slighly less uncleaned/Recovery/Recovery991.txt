The REAL reason you should never commit suicideIf you're feeling suicidal, this is the most important message you'll ever read.I'm not one to brag; it's the truth.A lot of people resist the idea of suicide(at least at first) because either they don't want to hurt their loved ones, or they think about holding on just a little while longer.Honestly, both these reasons are crap. Even if you're alive, you'll feel like you're hurting your loved ones.There is only one real reason that will reveal the truth about why suicide shouldn't be attempted: once you actually try it, you'll realise the HARD way that death is 10x worse than any pain you could feel in life.That's why all suicide survivors say they felt so stupid the minute they tried it.Ironic isn't it? It seems like a real good idea in theory, and you might even think you can do it no problemIt's all rubbish. That means you are trapped in this life. You don't even have suicide as a way out (you'll think yourself an idiot for even considering it in retrospect).And guess what: your body will have no choice but to find another outlet - that means finding the beauty in life, and accepting the crap parts for what they are. You have no choice.And Moderators, if you feel my post isn't "pro-life" enough, feel free to delete it. I really don't give a crap. I'm simply giving people the straight up truth why suicide is a wrong choice.
