My Depression Story I Guess!I never realized how depressed I was and for how long until the med I'm taking worked (thank goodness). After suffering through my entire junior high, high school and 5 years of adult life with horrible times, and then more recently after losing my job my apartment etc, I went to the dr to get help the same day I lost my job (4/4/14). I have been on Zoloft ever since. It's been a little over four weeks, and I feel more like my old self. I don't cry every night, have the bad thoughts I used to, and everything seems better now even though nothing has changed. I thought at first it was the placebo effect, but after four weeks I can't imagine I still would have this effect. I haven't had any noticeable side effects, that I attribute to this med but I still don't sleep great. Anyway, today I had my first therapy session, AMAZING. I guess I'm not as horrible as I thought, I'm actually really awesome and I think with counseling I'm going to learn a lot about myself and what I do and why I do it and also about my family and things. It's going to help me grow. So here's to my first month step on the way to greener grass.
