What Can I Do While Waiting For My Antidepressant To Kick In?Hi everyone, I want to know what activities and/or hobbies can I do while waiting for my AD to kick in?  I tried reading but I cannot focus nor comprehend what i'm reading. I tried movies and television, but I cannot focus and because i'm numb I cannot connect with what i'm viewing. I tried socializing but I cannot connect with who I am speaking with and talking feels like a chore. Also, I tried exercising but it makes me even more anxious. At the moment I cannot find pleasure in anything. Days feel like weeks and weeks feel like months. I'm open to suggestions and experiences. Thanks
