Feeling hopefulI just had to share this because I am feeling positive about it.  I had my first session with a new therapist yesterday and it went really well.  She understood me when I said Im not here to fix everyone else in my life, Im here to fix me and learn strategies I can use to help me deal with the crap as it comes up.  She asked me for some background for specifics like has there ever been violence in my home - as a child or an adult - and when I burst into tears I expected her to rub her hands with glee and say thats where all my problems have come from, but she didnt.  We talked a bit about it but she understood where I was coming from.  I have always lost interest in counselling when they start saying Id like to get your parents in for a session.  I told her my parents are 70, they know they made mistakes and they acknowledge that and feel bad for it.  What good it going over it again and making them feel worse for it than they already do??  She didnt push it and got straight to work on giving me some strategies that I can use to help me get through the tough times better.  The number one thing that has stuck with me is she said "you know its ok to feel these emotions dont you?"  Shes so right!  If I feel sad or angry I always just want to push it away and not think about what it is that is making me sad or angry.  I have to mention to that I got onto her through the Lifeworx program which my work has intiated.  Basically my work is paying for my first 3 sessions - all confidential and doesnt have to be anything to do with problems at work.  Im lucky that I work for a company that recognises the importance of good mental health and are being proactive and helping staff and in return hopefully reducing lost productivity due sick days. Im very glad I made the call and feeling hopeful that it is going to help me!
