So what does recovery really look like?I had major depression in 2006. Thought I had it beat, but my memory and cognitive function have never returned to anything like they were before.The doctor has said I need to go on a higher dose for an extended period of time. Which I have just started. He has assured me it will make a longer lasting change that will bring back my brains functionality.I function today although I am less confident in my own actions which is impacting my life. But I am planning for a new future which is quite exciting.My expectation is that after 6-9 months of enduring these drugs and the side effects I will stop taking them and my brain will return to a state somewhat close to where I was before my depression. I expect not to have to take them again unless I feel myself slipping back into depression.Am I being a little naive? What should I be expecting after this period? Should I expect to be on these drugs for longer than 9 months? I consider myself mild to moderate depressed.Also during this time I intend to go back to college to study. It does worry me as I am unsure if my brain will be able to cope. Will these drugs stabilize me making study better or will I find it harder to concentrate and retain information.Thanks for the insight.
