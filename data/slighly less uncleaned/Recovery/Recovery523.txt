  I've Come FarHi everyone,Wow, it seems like forever since i have been on here. I used to be such a different person and looking back on myself is very eye-opening. I just want to let everyone on here know that it eventually will get better. I am now 16, i'm healthy, happy and my life is back to where i want it. Please to anyone thinking on giving up like i did, don't because there is so much to life. Especially if you're young, there is so much of your life ahead of you. Yes, i still am depressed inside sometimes, but that comes with depression . I take it one day at a time and remember how many people care and i'm sure there are plenty of people who care for any of you too. Even if you don't see it, there is always  one person in this world that loves and cares  for you. It's not over and if anybody needs a friend, i'm here always. I've been through so much, but i've pushed through and that was the bravest thing i've ever done. i love you all <3 P.S. To anyone reading this, you're beautiful and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
