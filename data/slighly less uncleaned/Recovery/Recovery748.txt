I Am Not My ConditionHey folks! New here and hunting for forums to talk to other folk with mental illnesses (Schizophrenia and Depression here). Specifically trying to write an article at the moment and keen for feedback from anyone who feels they can relate at all! I know it's a little long (two parter) but I'd really appreciate your time and any feedback! Thanks!Possible Trigger Warning: This deals with depression, suicide and schizophrenia. And something we have to face that is often not spoken about.
