As dark as things get, it will get betterHi i thought i would share my story briefly , i have had undiagnosed since an early child/adolescent im in my mid 30's male and have finally hit a major wall in my mental health issues.my depression has affected my work relationships and well been for many years not knowing how to deal with depression and the stigma attached i tried bottling it in i found myself changing jobs and moving around to try and figure out why i was always so down , the past few years i turned to drugs and alcohol the combination of bottling up my mental health issues and intoxication of drug use lead my two serious offenses  . this was the 1st time in my life i had ever been convicted for any offense and it was extremely out of character and something i will regret for the rest of my life . this caused me to lose my job and my friends luckily my close family have supported me getting help and understanding what steps in life led me to where i am now. i urge everybodysuffering from mental health issues to talk openly about what your going through and not to bottle it all in, seeking professional help and having time to reflect on my health state and hearing from others about there depression has giving me a clearer mind state in dealing with my own depression, i thank everybody who has opened up to share there story and are grateful of organizations such as beyond blue. i have a long road ahead in dealing withmy depression and dealing with the repercussions of committing two offenses and rebuilding my life over, i know i have to try and stay positive and turn it all around   . dont let your mental health issues turn your life upside down seek help and as dark as things get , it will get better
