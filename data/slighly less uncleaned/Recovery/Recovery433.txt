  The Mircles In Life....Years ago, I became very sick. I was always vomiting, couldn't hold food down, and NO doctors had a clue as to why. I actually became so ill, that I lost over 100 pds in body weight! ( Starting weight...186, after surgery....82pds!) Finally, when my gallbladder had SO many stones in it, they did surgery. My body was in such bad shape, from being so sick, they didn't think I was going to make it. My daughter, actually, decided to check into funeral homes and make finally preperations. I can remember very few things, before the surgery. I started waking up, from being so sick. My body was just skin and bones, my arms and legs were crippled-could not move them at all! My hair, well, it almost all fell out and was very thin. I had to have over $13,000.00 dollars of dental work done! The dentist wouldn't even work on my teeth, till I gained over 20 pds of weight. I now have, very sever Fibromyalgia. I had some "signs" of it, before this all happened. Now, it's a lot worse than it ever use to feel or be. Even though, this "trip" has been extremely diffucult, hard, and very painful, I THANK GOD EVERY DAY FOR THE GIFT....THE GIFT OF LIFE!!!!
