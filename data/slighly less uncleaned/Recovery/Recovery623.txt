  Going on my second date *does a little dance*I'm putting this in 'getting better' because there is no way I'd have been dating a year ago or even six months ago, and in fact I haven't dated for six years or had a girlfriend since I was a teenager. This is major progress for me. I took her out for drinks last week and now I'm taking her out for dinner. We don't know each other that well so we're taking it slow, but I'm really into her and I can tell she's into me too. I haven't felt this happy in as long as I can remember
