You are all wonderfuli just want to say that everyone I have encountered on the forum are so wonderful. You are all nice caring and kind. Let's not forget understanding. I don't know you all but I love you guys. It's a comfort to talk to people and know I will not be judged... I hope   you are all unique and if the world had more people like you all it may be a better place . just a thought. Thanks I hope you all are moving in the direction you want to go, there are many paths to the same end so hang in there.
