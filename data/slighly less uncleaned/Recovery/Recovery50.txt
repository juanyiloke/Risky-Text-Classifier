HelloHey. I am new at this. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety a year ago, but am now having what feels like depression, and I wanted to see people's thoughts before I take the next step. I am perfectly okay during the day. My normal happy bubbly self. At about 10 or so I get this awful empty, lonely feeling. this feeling has started causing trouble for me and my fiancé because up until 10 minutes ago I was blaming him. I am pushing him and my sister away. I am having a lot of trouble sleeping. I feel drained during the day, and when I am off I sleep all day, but cant sleep at night. I don't know what to do and I am desperate for help. Sent from my SCH-I435 using Tapatalk
