  depression________________________________________Depression took over when I was 16. I was in a horrible relationship. Things didn't look good for me at all. I tried to kill myself I was so depressed. I wouldn't reach out for help, until my mom made me go to counseling (which was were I needed to be from the get go of my depression). I isolated myself quite often.Here I am know, I got and am still getting help, I am in a healthy relationship and don't want to hurt myself any more. The point of this story is that no matter what the cause of depression there is always help and there is always a way to be happy.
