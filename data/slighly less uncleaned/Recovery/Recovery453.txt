  Journal EntryHey everyone, I'm brandnew  to thecommunity , just wanted to share  with you the journal entry I just wrote..."I've had a very interesting couple  of years. Hell, I've had a very interesting 5 years. It's literally been that long since I've truly enjoyed life , and that's a very sad thing. All kinds of things have happened to me and I've experienced a lot in this time, both good and bad. Of course, with the bad things, I interpreted them as such and they contributed to my downward spiral. It is the good things that ended up being even worse, as I turned even them bad with my irrationality. With the way I interpret things, I have literally turned my life into a living hell for my entire university career.5 years. Imagine what I could have accomplished. Even more importantly, look at all the stuff I still accomplished. I know what I'm capable of, and although I've still managed a bit of success, it's only a shadow of what I can do.I'm done with depression . I'm done with being afflicted. I'm leaving this disorder  behind. I'm going to get on with my life, and I'm going to help  others get on with theirs. This doesn't need to be an ongoing problem with people in the world, and nobody deserves to feel the pain associated with it.If I go on like this, I will die. I choose LIFE."I'm finally starting to get better and things are looking up at last, and I want to help others do the same. That's why I joined this community, and I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you.
