  I'm sure by now you've all forgotten me!Hi all, I haven't posted in nearly a year! god, it feels strange to be here not looking for help but wanting to tell you all of my success. I have managed (for the moment) to beat back  the waves of depression! I'm working  in a place that I love (The people are awesome) and I'm with a woman that I truly love! Thats not to say that I still don't have bad days, I do, everyone does! I hope, that I won't go back to the bad old days, but I may yet. the future  is uncertain but for once in mylife  I am actually happy about this. In my heart I know that you guys are all strong people. I know that you can all make a great  impact on the world :) And I want you all to know, that even though I have never met you in person I love each of you from the very deepest part  of my heart! All that we can do is strive to survive! I know that each and everyone of you beautiful , amazing, kind and generous people can do it! For now I must, unfortunately did you a due, but I shall be back!just remember, you are all beautiful, even if you don't feel it, you are all amazing, strong people, and above all, even if you don't love yourselves right now somebody out there does and someday I hope that you will all love each other :) Good Luck and I hope tomorrow brings you a better day :)
