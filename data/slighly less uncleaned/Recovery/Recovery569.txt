  Happy Good Day- I woke up early today -- just before 7:00am. I had been oversleeping until 11 or 12 for the past two weeks or so.- I have a Calorie Counter account, and I got an A for the first time in weeks.- All my junk food was finished yesterday, and I drank the remainder of my juice today.- It was a hot day  -- 70 degrees -- for the first time in a while.- I stayed below my sodium limit.- I went for a long  walk (and burned 536 calories).- I didn't play Call of Duty : Black Ops all day, like I did over this weekend Hopefully, I won't stay up all night.
