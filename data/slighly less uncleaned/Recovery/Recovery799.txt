Starting life afresh after the black dogI first accepted that I had depression 12 months ago. In that time it has cost me my marriage, and 2 jobs. That said having separated from my wife, I am now in a happier place emotionally and I have a better relationship with my two kids. I have more energy to interact with them, and I get angry with them far, far less often then I did previously. So from that perspective things have improved, and I will take that over my marriage. This may sound cold, but I think a lack of understanding and support from my ex led to my depressed state becoming as severe as it did. So, I am at the age of 40, starting life afresh. This is challenging, but in a healthy and better way than previously. I am meeting new people and building healthy relationships with friends of my own. It took me some time to accept this, but I'm glad that I have, as I am better than I have been in years!
