Willpower>Depression, My Victories/failuresOver the coming days/weeks/whenever I have the free time, I'm going to post my story on here (it's way too much to do on a single post and I want to be as thorough as possible).  Even though I'm going to post all the necessary content of my triumphs/failures, I'm going to be purposely vague on some particular characters/locations (with 4000+ members on here, there's probably a decent chance that somebody on here might know who I am in real life and I want to avoid any conflicts with friends/family).  The main reason why I'm doing this is so anybody on here who is going through something similar to what I went through (or anything that can lead to depression at all) can find some hope/inspiration and overcome.  Also, I have given advice on here more than once that could come across as harsh and I want people to understand that any advice I ever give is intended to help, not harm (I just refuse to sugarcoat things).  With that being said, I hope all of you gain at least some value from my upcoming posts.
