  Comes and goes in wavesDoes anyone else find that their depression seems to come and go in waves? Like you'll have a week or so of feeling awful and then a while of feeling good, like the real you emerges from under the depression for a period of time and you can cope with life better and things dont hurt you or drag you down so easily? I have been having this for a few years now, I used to be depressed pretty much all of the time and just felt cold and boxed in and unable to see the positive in life. But I feel like things are getting better, although the lows can be crippling and very hard to deal with I feel like there is hope that one day it will disappear, once I've got to the bottom of it, to the root cause. My mum describes it as peeling back layers, everytime you enter a bout of depression it shifts something and something is revealed from under a layer. I like to think there is a positive reason for all this suffering. That keeps me here and fighting
