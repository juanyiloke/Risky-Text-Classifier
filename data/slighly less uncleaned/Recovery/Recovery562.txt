  Yay for me.Let's see. I'm not sure if this is a viable solution, but so far it seems to work. There are A LOT of things going on in my life  that for some reason I have somehow managed to not let bother me. Finacial issues, work issues, feelings of loneliness, etc. But for the most part, I just have stopped giving a fuck. Like, I literally just say fuck it. Which makes it SOOOO much easier to focus on the positives in my life right now. That my ex-wife finally signed over primary care of my boys. That I have a job . That I really don't want the headache of a relationship . Etc.I wouldn't go as far as to venture to call this happiness. But it isn't bad. I mean, it canalways  get worse. And when it does, I'll try to continue not giving a fuck. (I reread what I wrote, I admit I sound chopping and like an idiot. lol)
