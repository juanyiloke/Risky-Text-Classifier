  What I learned in hospitalThey did group activities daily at the hospital I was sent to. Last week was self awareness week. They taught us to get to know ourselves more and to discover where out boundaries are. I learned that I am a people pleaser and that I've got to learn to sometimes say no. They taught me the smart rules for setting goals and being able to ensure that I can achieve it.S - specificM - measurableA - achievableR - reachableT - timeI use this in everything I do, sort of like everything is a goal. Likle Sunday when I walked 5km up to the shop and then walked 5km home with 4litres of milk.
