My New GoalA bit about my situation first; I have social phobia and I'm uncomfortable going to places I don't know well on my own. I also don't like speaking on the phone, if I don't know what to say I just panic. So yesterday my family basically said they don't believe in me because of something I'm going through at the moment. So I got annoyed at that and thought well I'll show you then but now I've had time to properly think about it I want to do something for myself. Everytime I need to go somewhere I'm going to do it by myself, if I need to use the phone I'm going to use it myself. I suppose I want to prove that I can do it by myself and there's nothing to worry about but I want to do this for my future too. I just hope I don't lose this confidence :)
