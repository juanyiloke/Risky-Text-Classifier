For anyone interested in a Mindfulness Support GroupMy name's Ash and I'm interested in forming a group to discuss The Mindful Way Through Depression. Normally I don't have much time for books. I'm an author myself, so I tend to be pretty impatient with charlatanism and the industry in general.This is the first thing that's ever helped me through my Depression. I think a lot of the charm has to do (as with most things) with the teacher(s). The message is straightforward, but the way it's presented finally brings all that disparate common sense we all know, together. I've just joined here. What I hope to achieve is an ongoing dialogue where those who are into the program in the book and its insights can support one another to stay on track and really, finally get well. Apart from my wife, I've never had any friends. So you'll have to excuse me if there's some extraordinary taboo about barging in here and announcing something like this. I've had Depression pretty much all my life. I've tried everything bar getting my brain fried. I've even tried mindfulness and self-compassion prior to finding this book, and they provided only mediocre results at best. You'll notice I haven't provided a link to the book, that's to, again, avoid any accusations of spam. I know that if you're as keen as I am, you'll look it up.
