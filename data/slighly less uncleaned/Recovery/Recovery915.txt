Thank youIt has not been long, and although I do not post a lot I visit the site frequently. As I was on Google it made me remember the day I first came to this website. I sat staring at an....."object"...just thinking how easy it would be to commit suicide since I was alone in my room. that they wouldn't find me until the next morning. Afraid of the pain i started to look for easier ways and stumbled across this site. I was taken back by such a large community of people who feel same pain I feel. It has not cured my depression nor do I expect it to, but it has bought me time and when I had good days i thought would never come, to be able to experience them was indescribable, for that I am thankful. this was the website that stopped my suicide attempt.
