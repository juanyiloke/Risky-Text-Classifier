Let's talk about hobbies that we love!Friends,Tell me of your hobbies and the things you love   I play guitar, write music, poetry, etc... I also love to tinker with all kinds of projects... electrical wiring, handyman repairs, and all sorts of little projects I can wrap my little perfectionist brain around. I went to school to be a mechanic, so I'm a total gearhead (oil in my blood!) and now since I've been in a really depressed rut lately I'm currently thinking about buying my first motorcycle so I can learn a new skill and have something fun I can go out in the world and do, and get my head wrapped around a new passion.What I want to know is.... What do my fellow SF'ers do that they are passionate about? It can be anything. Please feel free to tell me- do you collect watches? stamps? work on computers? knit/crochet? ANYTHING GOES!Humor me with a light-hearted and happy thread we can all have fun with  -Neverender
