Blah Therapy: Helpful For Me.I just thought I'd share something that's been a helpful tool for me in the last couple of months while I've been dealing with a newly-diagnosed chronic condition and all the stress and illness that comes with that.  There is a website called blah therapy (blahtherapy.com). You can choose it you want to be a "listener" or a "venter." You agree to some terms of service that basically state that the people you'll be talking to are just other random people, not trained professionals or anything. Sometimes they don't know what to say to help, sometimes they hurt your feelings, etc. But I have found that overall, it's been a very helpful tool for me. When I'm very stressed out about my own issues and just can't concentrate on anything else, I go on there to vent. Most of the time when I go on there, though, I take the "listener" role. I've found that helping other people with their problems is a good distraction for me, and is often rewarding.  The site is completely anonymous- every time you get on you are assigned a funny username that you keep for 24 hours, and then the next time you get on (if it is more than 24 hours later) you have a new one.  Obviously it is a good idea to keep in mind some safe internet tips- I never share my name, where I'm from, or any other personal details about myself. I'll tell my age and if I'm male or female, but that's about it. Also, you have to be prepared for the occasional prankster or troll or jerk to come along, but I have learned to just brush them off and reconnect with someone better.  Anyways, just thought I'd share this. It's been helping me through some tough times. Sometimes it's really nice to talk anonymously to someone.
