Mind Over Mood - Change How You Feel By Changing The Way You ThinkAnyone has heard of this self help book?http://www.amazon.co...g/dp/0898621283I bought it some weeks ago from Amazon and I have to admit it's very good!Since there are no therapists around here that do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, I thought about looking for CBT self help books on the internet and this was in the list.Having never practiced CBT, it was totally new for me, but I didn't have to worry because the book is very well written and it's really a step-by-step therapy through exercises and worksheets. I'm at chapter 4 so I still have to start the true therapy, but I'm already feeling a bit better. Not that it saved me or anything, but I can tell there's a definite difference with how I coped with depression before and how I'm coping with it now.So I was wondering, has anyone read it as well? Did you try different self-help books (CBT or not) that helped you?
