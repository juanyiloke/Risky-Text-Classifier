  I think I'm done here. [this time I mean it]Well, as the title says I feel I am no longer in need of this account. The last few months have been really interesting for me in different ways that are inspiring a newer, better outlook. It's all revolving around music oddly enough. Doing remixes, getting remixed, collaborating with my favorite band [fuck yess!!], it's bringing new things out to the surface that I feel I must explore . I'm starting psychotherapy in July, but between then & now I'm going to work on sorting out all the smaller things like my social anxiety & self-doubt. And when August comes around, I'm going to start being more involved in my educational  needs. If everything goes right I'll have finally graduated next June. I've met some cool people here & some not so cool. Nonetheless, I wish you all the best  & thank you for all the support. Maybe I'll check  in every now & again, I still haven't figured that part  out yet.
