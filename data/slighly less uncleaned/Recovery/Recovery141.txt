I Just Got Back From A Great Walk.Maybe 4, 4 1/2 miles. Warm, slightly muggy air. Twilight coming on as I left, giving way to dark skies and a rising full moon on the route home. I can't begin to share what a big stress reliever this has been for me. Also really happy because I bought some new athletic shirts and pants that are a special fabric to wick away moisture and "breath" -- easily some of the most comfortable clothing I think I've ever worn, I'm in love with this stuff.Forgot to add, tonights soundtrack was 'The Very Best of Bon Jovi', and 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' and 'Achtung, Baby' by U2.
