Finding joy when times are darkHi everyone,I'm interested in hearing about the things people do to cope when times are rough.  Not the self-destructive things.  I'm pretty sure we're all familiar with those.  I'd really like to hear about the "little" things people do to try & bring a little joy to their lives.Below is a list of some of the things I like to do - mood permitting.Eat cheezels. Dipped in sour cream.  With chopsticks.Watch old Jerry Lewis movies.  Never fails to crack me up.Volunteer at the local Blue Light Disco.  Watching 200 kids runing around & dancing with joy just makes me smile.  My face actually hurts the next day. Yell at politicians on the telly.  This is excellent for venting one's spleen & always leaves one feeling refreshed.Go to the local shopping centre and just window shop.  I like to fantasise about all the nice things I'll be able to buy when I win tattslotto.  It also makes me feel less alone if I'm just around other people, even if I don't know them.Bake a cake.Use "Google Translate" to translate song lyrics from English to Japanese & back to English again.  Try it - it's a hoot.Eat a cake.Sing along to Hootie & the Blowfish.  (Umm, can we keep this one between ourselves?)Make something on the sewing machine.  Current project - making pouches out of old woollen blankets for injured wildlife.Have a crack at making my own fudge.Find a spot in the sun and just sit for a while.Regards
