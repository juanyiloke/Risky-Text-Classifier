Talking is only the first stepI think the ABC did a great job this week raising awareness of depression and anxiety. I found it both compelling and confronting. Many triggers as I identified with people in different stages. Especially seeing ECT live. One issue that frustrated me was the shallow approach of "if you talk about it you will feel better".  I see it that if you talk about it that is the first step to getting help. Not an instant fix. They only brushed over the concept that many diagnoses take many years to reach and then even longer with trial and error to reach a treatment plan for each individual to manage their illness. And they can be managed. Although I am quite well at the moment, these shows took me back to the dark places as memories. Am I alone?
