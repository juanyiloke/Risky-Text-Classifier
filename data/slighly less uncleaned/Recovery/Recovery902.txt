Don't rely just on hope. Focus on what's nextAung San Suu Kyi said something interesting recently about how she got through difficult times. She said she didn't always think about hope but rather on what was next. I think we, myself included, rely on hope to get us through things. Hope is great but it's not tangible and so sometimes we can lose grasp of it, and when we do, we can feel lost. But focusing simply on what you can do next, I think that can be grounding and a particularly powerful motivator.
