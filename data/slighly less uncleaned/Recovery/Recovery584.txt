  Update On My Life...So here is a lil update  on my life  since i moved out from my parents house.Since i moved out in November last year things got much better...its like i got re-charged like a battery, its wierd the more closer i am to them the more i hate them i hate everything to do with them..but at same time i dont want to hurt them...i still dont really have my own flat..but am coping.I met some cool azz people at the place i stay they are like the staff...they are voulnteers from all over the world.anywayz i started to do things finaly go swiming,go gym, just normal things college is going fine too,but thing is am much better but still really lonley i dont have anyone to hang around with in this town i live in..i got few homies from other towns but i never really get to see hem..and when i get real lonely thats when its the hardest....thats when i want to give up all this and just end it cause im tired of not having anyone...idk if this is in the right section but yeah..
