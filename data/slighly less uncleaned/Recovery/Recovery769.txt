Apologising for behaviourI was just wondering if there if anyone has ever apologised for their behaviour while they were depressed or dealing with other mental health issues? I'm in the middle of honours year and felt depressed for the first 5 months of it. As a result I haven't been social with my lab, who are a very welcoming group of people, I haven't been contributing to lab meetings, I've been missing them often, or showing up late. Occasionally, I feel like I've let depression affect my behaviour so that I've made curmudgeonly comments in discussions, and I'm embarrassed by my behaviour. To make matters worse, I switched universities to be part of this lab because I'm really interested in the research they do, and feel like I've brought a negative attitude to the environment. I'm no longer feeling depressed, and have some energy back. I would really like to turn things around become a contributing member of the lab, but I feel like I've already put myself in a particular role, and I don't know how easy it will be to change it. I was thinking about apologising to my supervisor for missing meetings as a start, and telling him that I'm feeling much better mentally, because he was aware that I was feeling unwell at the start of this project. Has anyone else dealt with this type of thing?
