If you're suicidal - you have proven yourself worthy of staying aliveI've said this before, and I'll say it again, because it's something that doesn't crop into people's heads (at first).If you think about it, you will realise that by thinking about suicide, that is just proof that you are worth keeping alive. It means either A) you don't want to hurt other people, and/or, B) you are determined for change.Those are 2 of the best qualities a person can have. Unfortunately a suicidal person cannot see this in themselves because of the pain of depression. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, who is using this site, easily fits into this category of being fantastic. I beg you, please don't surrender. Do whatever else you can to step around the depression demon. The pain is unbelievable; but you are worth too much to be lost to the world. If you don't understand why, simply read the top 2 paragraphs again.This isn't a simple warming message to try and make you feel better. It's a fact - and it's an unbreakable one.
