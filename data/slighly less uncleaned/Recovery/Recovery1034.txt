More ink, less scars :)Hi friends,It's been a rough day for me but I just had a nice conversation with a friend, she and I both have history with cutting ourselves. We came to common ground on something cool, we both have turned to tattoos as our means of hiding all these old scars. Any other ink lovers on here? I myself have been working on getting tattoos over all my prominent scars and it's wonderful for me. Instead of an unknowing person seeing my arms and asking what's wrong with my arms, they just see ink   It makes me happy to be able to put meaningful artwork over these old reminders of suffering. I will have to be one very heavily tattooed fellow before they're all concealed forever... But what a wonderful trade-off it is. Anybody else doing this? If not, look into it. A talented artist is very good at helping you with this, and you'd be surprised how many artists have suffered the same curse and are passionate about helping you trade your scars for beautiful art. Next month I'll be starting a HUGE piece in dedication to my late grandmother which will cover what used to be my "frequent zone" on my right arm. Such a symbolic move for me personally- to cover my life pain with artwork in the name of one of the only people who ever truly loved me. I am thrilled, one of the rare excitements in my life!Ink lovers, chime in  -G
