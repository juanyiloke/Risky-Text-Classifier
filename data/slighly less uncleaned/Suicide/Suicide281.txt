im not even really sure i need helpId like to believe that i could free myself from the clutches of depression, still i feel the void grow deeper, i've lost meaning, direction, empathy, i feel numb again. i want to remember what it feels like to smile, i want to remember what it feels like to dance, i want to remember what it feels like to laugh hard enough to make your chest hurt. lately it doesnt matter though. i can sit in my room and get high until i pass out from boredom, and simple conversation with strangers and friends just seems so pointless. its all the same. its all the same... what is the ultimate form of reality? the goals seem endless but they all lead to death.. so whats the point? there is none... either way i feel its necessary to float through life just to see what happens... or maybe im just to scared to kill myself..  maybe one day ill get bored enough to just do it but no one really knows. and it sucks that i have to come to a website like this one just to share that in my little head theres a man screaming at the top of his lungs while i crack a smile and shake your hand "please to meet you"  no offense or whatever to regular usersi just wish i actually had a friend that understood what it really felt...to not feel anything..
