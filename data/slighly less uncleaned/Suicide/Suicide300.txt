Cant't Stop Wishing For The EndWanting to die is nothing new at all to me but sometimes there are things that trigger my thoughts even more. Yesterday my so called boyfriend got some new medication that he says is like a sedation medication which will put you in a deep sleep. Anyway, I half-jokingly said, "will it put you to sleep forever because if it does I might want to take it." And then this insensitive asshole says, "oh I suppose if you take the whole bottle it will put you to sleep forever." "Why don't you take it and find out." ANd then when I stormed out of the room and isolated myself and shut down he claimed to "just be joking." If you know your girlfriend is extremely depressed as I told him countless times, how can you even make a joke about something like that? How can some scumbag man who claims to care for you even say something so cruel, heartless, and unfeeling? But I'm used to comments like these not only from him but other abusive scumbags I've dated in the past. I'm all for laughing and joking and trying to have a good time but some things you just shouldn't be joking about and severe depression and suicidal tendencies are a couple of them. It's amazing that men can treat me so cruel and then when I get upset and storm out of the room or cry or yell or however I reactto the cruelty I'm the one who gets called crazy or I'm acting crazy or whatever bullshit they try to tell me. When in reality I'm doing what any sane girl would do if her piece of shit boyfriend treated her like shit.
