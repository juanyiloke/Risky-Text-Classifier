I am desperateFayWell,I’ve never really been loved in my life. My family doesn’t like me,men don’t like me because of me being fat and sarcastic and I have no friends. About a year ago,I met a guy on the internet and we haven’t stopped talking since then,we chat,we talk on the phone,we even make videocalls. He says he likes me,that I am worthy,that he wants to be with me and I want to be with him as he’s my last resort but he is far away and I have lied to him on some aspects. I’m not searching for forgiveness or consoling words,I know I am a bad person,my family taught me to be a bad person,I just can’t live with him knowing I’m a hypocrite,a liar,but I can’t live without him either.My life sucks and I have lost interest in it.I just wanted to talk to somebody.I’ve been thinking of commiting suicide but I am too afraid of failure and its consequences.
