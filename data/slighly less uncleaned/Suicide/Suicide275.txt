If I had any motivation left it's gone nowI don't see the point in living anymore. I have no life of my own, I am just a servant to others (namely family). If I'm not depressed to the point of wanting to kill myself, I am numb. "What are your goals?" "What do you want from life?" What does it fucking matter what I want? I'm at the point where even if I did have the motivation, there are so many other things preventing me from being 'normal'. I can't relate to others... I get really anxious around people in general. I'd still be fucked if my depression was gone tomorrow. So why waste anymore time?ÊI can't remember the last time I was happy. I really don't.ÊI really should be dead. Therapy? Just trying to prevent the metaphorical boat from sinking by trying to plug holes. It's pointless. Most of the boat is already underwater.
