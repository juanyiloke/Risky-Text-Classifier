Nothing is realTristyI should be happy but I am not. I feel like this reality has nothing to offer me. I have a good job and a loving family, and most of all a loving relationship. How can I still be suffering? I have no motivation and every day I put in the effort to be positive only to face dissapointment again and again. I attempted suicide when I was 18 when I had no hope. People promised things would get better, and they did, but my feelings never changed. I know I have to keep living for those who rely on me, but their love will always be a burden. I don’t want to ruin their chance at happiness.Lately I have been thinking about killing myself in ways that would look like an accident. I can’t do it partly because I am afraid and partly because the guilt of leaving is still there.
