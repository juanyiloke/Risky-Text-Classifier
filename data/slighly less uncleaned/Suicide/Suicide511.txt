summaryjoshI am trying to figure out why I feel the need to communicate at this point. One of the things others consider wrong with me is my disdain for most humans. I have been different than most since I was eight at least. I have thought of suicide since then, not because I was sad. I really do not like life. I have the same survival instinct as any one else I suppose. I just do not enjoy living. I have a large loving family, and I was raised deep in the church, so I had to always put on a guise as, “a very well dressed and polite young man”. Even at a young age, I saw all the lies that I and others are forced to swallow until we are are droned into saying we like it. All around religion, government, even some things at home. I took too many pills at fifteen, I hung myself at 29. Then I thought I got a grasp on it. My wife and I met when I was twenty nine. I am thirty five now. We lost our newborn daughter a couple of years ago. Since then…………. Here I am, my dead daughter next to me in a beautiful urn, failed marriage, no relationship with family anymore(I depress them). I rarely even speak to humans anymore, besides at work. I have failed attempts, and years of wisdom now. I know I will not fail again. I am not writing this so anyone says anything uplifting, because it is not. There was always something making me have to try to function properly, it is not there anymore, I am not a good person inside. I am tired of the cycle. Most of my affairs in order. I think a good death on your terms, is a good thing. For some a “good thing” does not happen often. If you read this and your shit is not as bad, DONT DO IT.
