Giving uplonelyGrowing up, you think depression only happens to people who are lonely. To people who are poor. To people who are unsuccessful. But as you grow, you realize this is not true. You realize depression is more than that. You realize depression is a state of being that completely consumes you and controls your life. I never thought I’d be a victim of this horrible disease. I have always been popular. I have always been pretty. I have always been smart. I will never truly understand the manifestation of this disease.I am 20. I am a nursing student, and I work at a hospital as a nursing assistant. I am pretty, and I am extremely smart–A straight-A student. But I have lost all hope in life… I feel as though life is pointless. I feel as thought I am working so hard for nothing. I don’t want this life. I don’t want to be here. I think it has a lot to do with living in my hometown still. There is absolutely nothing here for me anymore. I need something new, but I cannot just pick up and leave. I don’t know what to do. I don’t like the person I am or the thoughts I think. I just need a way out. I don’t want to commit suicide, because I could never let my family deal with that. I just want hope. I want excitement. I want to feel like life is beautiful again.
