I Need A Lot Of Help This Is ItHello I'm Quinn. I am thinking about suicide. I can't stop it I just want to end it all. Everything is bullshit recently and it's suffocating to endure. No one will answer my plea for help this is like my last shot. I can't take it anymore it's infuriating and so horrible. PAIN. I'm not weak or selfish I've thought of everything but I'm convinced it's better without me. I'm getting bad again, and no one has noticed. I'm supposed to be better by now dammit  music is the only escape I have left. Screaming lyrics barely keep me alive
