 i have figured it outi am not here in this life for me. i am only here for everyone else. so broken and so alone. having everyone'sback, and no one ever having yours, except to keep you here to take care of them, until they can replace you. i don't need to be here. i am just a body that does work, a brain that does finances and a mouth that tells everyone how great they are. and when one of those fails, i am a useless entity.i failed.so why keep eating? why drink water?i wasn't supposed to notice, but now i do.i wasn't supposed to be born.i wish i could just turn off feelings. maybe i will learn how.
