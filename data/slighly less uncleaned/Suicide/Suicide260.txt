I don't even want to die... It's just easier than living,I came to this forum to post about depression, and to just have somewhere to write my feelings, without worry that friends or family will see it. However, everytime I talk about how I feel, all I can think about is the ease of ending everything. I can't post there so I have come here.Whilst there are many things that could contribute, the overriding feeling is a lack of hope in my future. I don't like to be that guy who whines about it, but I'm never going to be a success financially, romantically or in any other way.I'm sick of people telling me how nice a guy I am. Because at the end of the day, that means nothing. It just means that however many years down the line, I will be a nice failure. All my current friends will move on with their future ventures in life, and I will still be just about making it, probably contemplating suicide daily still.I don't really know where I'm going with this post. I guess just to put it out there. I don't even know whether I will ever kill myself. There have been a couple of close calls, but maybe it's just one more thing that I can't even do.
