MyselfNo.I dont want to do this anymore. I like a few people but there is just one person I hate so much with a passion. Myself. I truly do hate myself. I have lots of problems. Not with people. But myself. I just want to kill myself already. I cant stand myself sometimes. I dont care about myself anymore. I just dont. I hate myself, i hate the way i look, the way i talk, the way i act, and everything. There is no way to change it because thats just me. I dont like me. I want to be someone else. Someone beautiful. Someone worthy. Not a fat, ugly, piece of shit. Im just so useless in life. I cant do anything. I dont have talents or anything like that. I see so many people with talents. Even ones that may seem stupid. Its still a talent. I just want another chance. Just one more. I want to start over. I want to be someone who can be amazing. Not me.
