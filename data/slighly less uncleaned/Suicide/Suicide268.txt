I dont care anymore I want to dieTired of being a guinea pig, tired of being poked and prodded, tired of adverse side effects, tired of my concerns/complaints being dismissed, tired of experiencing withdrawl like a fucking drug addict. I just want it all to end and now...... But I have to wait and suffer till I get my affairs in order. This illness has taken my life away, I had a shot at a decent life once. But my own stupidity and this illness completely destroyed that. Why? Why do we have to suffer? What is the point? Fuck this, I plan on leaving before things get worse.

Wishing for a quick endingI think about it alot, a end to my misery and failed life. Years ago I was diagnosed with schizoaffective. For those who do not know that is depression and schizophrenia. While my meds have kept it in check for years, its been an ongoing struggle to find a med that doesnt have side effects on me. Right now I'm suffering from Tardive Dyskensia, random movement of the neck and in my case lips. I cant go in public like this. All my dreams are gone. I have lost my independence, my job, my apartment, any hope of meeting a cute girl or a chance at a family of my own. I am already 40 and I live at home with my parents and sister. All I do is exist while I eventually wait to die anyway.I want to go out on my terms, not at the mercy of this illness and medication side effects. I want to go out as a normal human being with my sanity. I cant live like this waiting for the symptoms to return or continue with this weird movement with my lips i cannot control. Its hard to eat, hard to talk and hard to sleep. I need to find a way to put this miserable existance away. I dont want to live like this further.
