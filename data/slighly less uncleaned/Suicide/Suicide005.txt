i don't want to go on.I am feeling really low today. I don't want to go on. I hate everything about myself. The only reason i am not killing myself is that i don't want my kids to know the stigma of having a parent die to suicide.Any reason to live though right? I took *Mod Edit: Methods* hoping it would give me some pain so i knew i was alive but even they are not working. My partner is asleep next to me, snoring. I don't think he knows how much pain i am in.He does know i deleted facebook though
