I trusted a girl againJoeyI began my life with suicidal tendencies because of major bullying in elementary. They would lock me in small dark spaces like a dumpster for hours on end, put me in a small trashcan and dump worms on me, and start hanging me off a two story building until I started crying. I grew up, and they left. I met a young girl by the name of Alexandra at the age of 10, and we ‘dated’ for 6 years. She ended up cheating on me and told everyone I knew outside of my school that I was suicidal and a schizophrenic freak. I met another girl by the name of Alexandra soon after I promised myself never to trust anyone again. She couldn’t deal with my depression pill after effects and ended her relationship with me, and proceeded to contact my school about my suicide which I so snugly evaded. I lost the most important thing in my life again, and I want to die. My friends Pollie and Gavin and looking out for my best interests and are telling me to keep trying to get her back – that I’m a good guy and even though I got wrecked from the past I can work for something to live with. I need support, I don’t know what I’ll do if I lose her forever.
