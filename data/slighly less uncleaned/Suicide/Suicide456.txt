I resisted now I give upÉJonathan RosalesEverything started when my mom began to develop an alcoholic problem. I was just 11 when everything started! She broke my father«s heart, she broke my sister«s heart and mine. She would always put us in physical danger when she would get drunk!!! She even scared my dad«s mouth by throwing a cup at him!!! :,( Then I came to Guatemala to get some vacation. Then, after some time, my father said we were to stay here until my mother got cured and was all better. When he told her that, she went nuts. She said we were never to call her again and was really mad with us. I felt horrible not living with my mother. After awhile, we went to the beach, and my grandmother called me and my sister. She said that we would actually live better here and more relaxed. She promised that nobody here will have the same addiction my mother hadÉ SHE HAS BEEN GETTING DRUNK EVERY NIGHT LIKE MY MOTHER! SHE LIED! SHE SPAT IN MY FACE!! I RAN AWAY FROM MY HOME, FURIOUS AND PISSED AT ALL MY FAMILY!!! I ALMOST THREW MYSELF OFF A CLIFF!!! After sometime, my aunt and uncle, whom I am now currently live in, put pressure on me for my education WHEN I DO NOT EVEN CARE ABOUT MY EDUCATION!!! I gave up for sure, I am cutting myself, I JUST WISH I MAKE PROGRESS AND SINK A KNIFE DEEP DOWN MY FOREARM!!! I gave up, I gave up on God, the only thing that is holding me back, and although it sounds stupid, is the girl who I am in love with. She is heartbroken by this, and I do not like to know that she is heartbroken thanks to me. I love her and everything, but sadly, I gave up. I will soon try to poisin myself with bleach. I ncase you wonderÉ September 7th or 6thÉ that is my date. Farewell Michy, I love youÉ remember that :,(
