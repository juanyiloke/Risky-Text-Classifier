TiredJustinIm just tired of trying you know? I worked so hard at being the greatest person I could be, but death came and grabbed my first girlfriend away from due to cancer at 16… Here I am, a few years later, and turns out my new girlfriend has been cheating on me. For the past couple of months. Did I do something to deserve this? When I was 7 my family split apart and kicked my parents, me, and my brother out of the family. They said we werent welcome anymore… You know why? Because my brother was moving out and my mother wanted to have one christmas, just the four of us. So my gran kicked us out of the family… 2 years ago I switched from my crappy christian school I was attending to cyber school (school on the computer). Now Im only a couple credits away from graduating early and we might be moving… my life honestly just feels like its falling apart. Kinda like Im in a boat that sprouts a new hole every 5 seconds and all I have to fix it is some tape. and no matter how much tape I use or how fast I patch those holes, Im still gonna drown. Im just delaying the process. anyone got any ideas? cuz im just out…
