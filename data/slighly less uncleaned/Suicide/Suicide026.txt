Never gotten this bad before, kind of worriedHello everyone, in the first of my thread I mentioned things in my life troubling me right now but this has been my darkest hour ever. I've been here before, highly OCD (contaminations), no job, no friends, getting on my parents nerves with it, guilt over the past or wishing I could talk to my ex. I just need to be told it's going to work out. I've been holding on for three years this Saturday and I'm too tired to keep going. Nothing is bring me happiness in life right now which is bothering me because I've been there before. Thanks for taking the moment.
