Plan to end it all by the end of the summerI am getting my affairs in order.My mom died in 2007, my brother in 2012.ÊI am just tired of life's disappointments and cannot stand being alone.I feel like I have contributed all I can to the world.Not sad really. Just tired. There are days when I cannot make it till my target date.I have some obligations to keep that will not be finished until the ed of August.My lease ends then too.lostSorry I haven't been here for awhile. Still struggling. Feel like I always will. I came here because it's the only place i can say what I am thinking which is that I don't know if I can just keep going. I'm so tired. I don't belong anywhere. I have no family Can't seem to have children. My life is nothing.I don't even have the energy to express what is going on...just more of the same...nothingFeeling emptyI don't know why I'm here. No matter how many times I've tried to talk on the crisis line, all I do is cry and they can't hear a word I say. I occasionally was harassed because of my gender identity, or how I looked. It used to bother me a lot but I don't care anymore. I don't even know what Im saying. Nothing makes any sense. I just feel completely empty. I guess I wanted to find someone who might want to talk. I'm not expecting anyone to answer this post. I think I just needed to unload my mind at this point so I can feel free.
