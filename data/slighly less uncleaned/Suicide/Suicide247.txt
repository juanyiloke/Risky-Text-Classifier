Should I leave behind a .....Note? This will not happen too soon, but I was gonna leave one for my family and a different one for friends, cause they do not know that I am mentally ill. Only my 5 childhood friends know that I have been suicidal in the past, but they never knew why, other than I felt my life sucked and I wanted out. They do not know that I suffer from depression and schizophrenia or the terrible side effects of the meds that I endure. I am not quite sure what to say in it? (the one to my friends) Should I start at the beginning? I guess that would be a good spot to begin, I have been living with this for 13 years. At least they will know that I fought and didnt just leave for no real reason at all. I have even thought of asking them to do me one favor, carry my body to it's final resting place. I do not like my mom's family, I do not want their filthy hands on my casket. Hell I'd prefer them not be there at all. But would it be selfish of me to ask them to do me that one favor? I dont think I've ever asked them for anything or much in my life. I hope it is something they would do for me. But to make things clear before I go this route I'm gonna make one last push to learn web design and pull my life together. If the side effects grow worse or my condition worsens then I intend to put an end to everything.
