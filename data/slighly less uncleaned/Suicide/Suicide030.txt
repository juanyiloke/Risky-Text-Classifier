Should I tell my friends...?Hello everyone. I recently decided I want to end my life after seeing my friends one last time when they get back from college. My mind is made up, an earlier attempt of<mod edit - methods> (I called 911 as a change of heart but it was a mistake.) left me with a partially usable left hand but I'll never play clarinet or piano like I once could. I severed the ulnar artery and nerve. On top of that I have medical debt out the wazzoo and the reason for my first attempt never really got resolved. This thread isn't about doing it or not doing it.ÊWhat I'd like to know is, should I tell my close friends? I want them to know that when I tell them good bye it will be the final one. However it might cause more hurt than closure and plus they might call the authorities on me. Happy to be a new user here! Anyway, thought? Opinions?
