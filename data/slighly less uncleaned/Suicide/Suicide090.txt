I am so lost I don't know where to turn anymore.I am at a complete lose lately. I don't know what to do. I have nightmares that just feel so completely real. If i think about it they were real at one point. It's things from my past. I was recently told I have PTSD and these nightmares and flashbacks I've had since in my teens would be with me forever. Lately it's feeling like it's getting to be too much. I just wish It could stop! I have these bad thoughts, things i don't believe i'd ever do to myself but I continue to have them and sometimes it sounds so much better. Everything will just stop if I go through with them. But i just can't Ive been a fighter since I was a child, I had to in order to live another day. Back then i refused to die from the hands of anther and if i can live through that why is it the memories are breaking me down? I can't seem to answer this anymore. I don't know but between the nightmares and these bad thoughts I don't know how much more I can take. I'm always talking bad on my self or having a horrible opinion of myself. I dunno is this wrong?
