cant do this anymoreBianca McKieI can’t live like this anymore. Every morning I dread getting out of bed. if it wasn’t for my daughter, I wouldn’t. I know she would be much better off without me, both her and her father. She’s only one so she wouldn’t miss me anyway. All me and her dad do is argue, because I’m constantly fucking things up. I’m the worst role model for my daughter. How am I supposed to look after her when I can’t even get my own shit together? Her dad can’t stand to be in the same room as me coz all I do is cry, all the time. he hasn’t come to bed in months, and barely talks to me. After my daughter’s first birthday in a couple of weeks I’m going to use an exit bag and some helium. I hate myself for leaving her but I know she won’t remember me after a couple of weeks, and she’ll be better off without me. I tried, I really did, I just can’t do this anymore. I just hope she knows how much I love her.
