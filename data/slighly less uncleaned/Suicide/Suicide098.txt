How do you keep going?What if you reach out to people, only to find they all turn on you in your time of need? What do you do when even professional help is slowly being taken away from you? How do you keep on distracting yourself from the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness? What keeps you going, what makes you get out of bed every day? I'm just wondering what works for everyone else, because I'm about at the end of my rope and not sure how much more of this I can take.
