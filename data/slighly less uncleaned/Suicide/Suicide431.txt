my storygaryHi. I choose to go by Gary here. I’ve noticed there’s another Gary here. Well about me and my experience. I am 49. I’ve been sober close to 4 years. Im straight. Never married. Never wanted kids. I always felt I’d be a poor father plus depression since early on concerned me. I’m the fuked up middle child of a sick and selfish mother and what I’m realizing has been a weak father. I’ve had a lonely existence. I’ve always been a little different. I look back now and know why I drank. Fear and insecurity. Fear of the uncertainty of life and not feeling comfortable in my own skin. I think I’ve been planning suicide for years. I don’t want to hurt anyone and doubt I would if I were to follow through. I don’t want to fuk my nieces and nephews up though. But they too may get over it in good order. I was pretty much ignored growing up. I did manage to get a job that supports me. I’m well educated yada yadda. I’m bored with it though. I’ve never been that driven. I’ve always wanted that passion that most people seem to have but never found it. I’m pretty disillusioned with the life thing and the notion of a god that loves me (reCently fallen away catholic). Few friends if any. People fuk you over. I’ve been treated for depression with meds since my 20s. I look back on my life at this point and its just been empty. II wish I would die and am afraid I will eventually succumb to suicide. I continue to fight but the loneliness has been painful lately. That is a double edged sword because I don’t like most people and hate false types especially. Anyway just sharing my story. But thoughts on suicide are becoming more frequent. I have this dark side to me. An emptiness. I wish it would go away. But man life is a bitch
