pain during suicidehi there, i am just a normal guy, does normal thing but everyone seem to do things better than me, at work(lost that), looking after my kids(in process of loosing them), someone always telling me what to do and that checking ive done it right and telling everyone else things before me, i just feel lost like i don't matter any more redundant, all i feel i have left is on my life insurance i am worth £250,000 and my mortgage is paid off, so my fiancée will be sorted.Any way to my point, I don't think i will attempt suicide because i will probably do it wrong, i have been reading methods and wondering why are people moaning how much pain they will be in, why does that even matter if i did do it, i wouldn't care i would be doing it to make sure i was dead so it doent really matter about the pain it takes, i am in pain already and i am living with that.
