You tell me, am I guilty?ChrisI was just recently arrested and charged with a DUI. First of let me say I was not drinking and coming home from at 10:00 pm at night after working a double between the 2 jobs I work. I was pulled over and asked for the license, regerstation, insurance. I am a totally legit driver but gave her an old car insurance card so I came back suspended. Next they ask if there is anything in the car which I admit to having $5 of pot on me and just give it up. Next thing you know I’m taking a sobriety test in which they tell me I somehow failed sober. They place me under arrest for DUI and now tell me I’ve been charged with suspended regerstation and now speeding. They now rip my car apart and find nothing at all. Car gets inpounded as well. The cops even said to me we aren’t going to give you a breathalizer because we know you haven’t been drinking but we will be doing a urine test. Let me say I have 2 prior conviction for DUI back in 2009, went through to jail, probation, classes, and tons of $$$. It was a long 2 years but I did everything neccary to get my license back and clean up my life. I got my license back in the December of 2010 and can look anybody in the eye and say I have not drank and drove once nor drove impaired. This was actually the first ticket I’ve received since getting my license back. A 3rd DUi will basically ruin my life and almost at the point of whats the point of living. I would rather no longer be here then have to go through what I went through. I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong but a DUI on Cinco De Mayo to a sober man driving home from work with 5$ pot on him is alittle extreme.
