Why care anymore?Do I have a name?Why care about myself anymore? No one else does so why should I? I think the world would be better off watching me die… If you were to kill yourself would anyone care? Haha nope… Why would some one I’m worthless and unwanted… Some one tell me do you feel this way… Do you believe what people say about you because I believe what they say about me… I’m ugly I’m fat I’m crazy I’m stupid I’m.. I’m.. I’m… Everywhere do you feel like life isn’t gonna get better?!?!? I do because everyone tells me that and there isn’t any signs I can’t erase what I did but then again my actions are like tattoo’s… Sorry mom I disappointed you…
