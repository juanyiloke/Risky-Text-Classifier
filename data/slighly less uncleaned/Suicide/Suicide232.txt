Just can't anymore.My life have been better and worse, right now I'm just so fed up.I looked at my old university photos and they were so wonderful, I was happy.Now I live with my parents as I'm told to, work a job I dislike because I'm told to, literally watching life passes through me. I have no goals, no dreams, living my life like a dead person. The only thing I hope for is that one day I will be free, to go wherever I want and do whatever makes me happy (within reasons) , but that day, is so far away, I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.How do I carry on? I can't.I'm so fed up with my life. I've been on help and depression forum for 10 years, I've read all the advice that was available, I've been told to open up, make changes, been told it's up to me, been told no one else can do it for me, been told that it is up to me to speak up, literally been told everything that I have heard of, but I can't try anymore, I can't do it when I'm chained up, physically(metaphorically) and emotionally.Just can't anymore.
