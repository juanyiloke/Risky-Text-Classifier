don't want to see tomorrowTomorrow is an "all hands" meeting for the division president which I avoid like the plague because they end long after I go homeMy boss came by my cube and in no uncertain terms "suggested" that I make every effort to attendFound out they want to trot me out as proof that this is a great place to work because I've been here 30 yearsTreated like shit, stripped of every single perk I ever earned, now all I'm good for is propaganda - making me sick to my stomachThen someone comes around to take my picture for the presentation - I couldn't do it - haven't shaved in 4 years so I don't have to look at myself in the mirror It's all so wrong - was finally starting to back away from a breakdown now - can't even breathe - guy on the train keeps looking at me like he's afraid of what I'm going to do Even now no one understands that they are all more important than me - I will hurt myself instead of anyone elseCan't think straight - so exhausted - no good sleep in a year and insurance is dragging its heels on approving the last thing I can trySick of it all - if this is all I have - pathetic life - only good as a show pony - then I don't want to see tomorrow - don't want to through this any moreI am so fucked up that I will be better off dead - fuck everyone else - I don't care what I leave behind
