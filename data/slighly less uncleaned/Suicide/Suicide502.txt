Now or never.NickMy wife hasn’t cheated on me but it feels like I’ve been replaced. She has no attraction to me whatsoever. She does try, and I appreciate that but in reality it makes it worse. I feel rejected, ugly, unwanted worst of all unneeded. I love my wife with all of my heart but the moment we got married it’s like she didn’t want me anymore. For 5 years I have been working my ass off to be the man she wants and needs but the reality is all she needs or wants from me is the security of a house partner. All I want is her but she has no attraction to me. I want to die, I want to keep trying. But if I go on and she wants kids then I don’t think I could have escape. I couldn’t abandon my child. So I guess the choice is now or never.
