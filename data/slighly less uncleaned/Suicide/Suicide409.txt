Coming UndoneBreeI have been fighting depression all my life. I have seen numerous therapists and psychologists. I have been put on a couple anti depressants and a bipolar medication. None of it is helping. Every single day I fight the urge to cut or to down the whole bottle of pills. I feel the only reason I am alive anymore is because I still have custody of one out of the three of my children. One lives with their father because I was living in an unfit environment at the time and the youngest I adopted out because I didn’t have the financial means to take care of him. I am battling this every single day. I cry myself to sleep. I have nightmares. Hell no one even loves me or wants me. They’ve admitted it to my face. I have no friends. My family doesn’t support me. They feel that since I am not related by blood that I don’t matter. I am so sick of trying to live anymore. I am alone in this world and just want to die.
