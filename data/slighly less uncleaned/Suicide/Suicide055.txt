constant headache, 6 years+I have been living with a constant burning pain around my forehead, on my nose, on and around my eyes for over six years with photophobia. This pain never goes away or even goes down very much. Now I am having some trouble with my vision but doctors cannot find anything obvious. I don't bother to take pain medication because it doesn't do much. I forgot what is was like to have no physical pain, I would do almost anything to be a day without it.I am taking some medication recently to try and reduce the pain but I don't think its going to work very well. The only thing "obvious" is a septal spur pressing on some nasal nerves but I had it for a very long time before the pain started, and the surgery is tough and expensive and I don't feel like I have the strength and conviction to get it done, like I would have to convince a doctor, then the state insurance, and I think its like a 25% chance it would cure the pain, and there is even a chance its going to make it worse.ÊI don't know what to do. I cannot live like this because I cannot do anything and my health is deteriorating. Living with this pain sucks because there is no obvious explanation and I have no support to deal with it or find a solution.
