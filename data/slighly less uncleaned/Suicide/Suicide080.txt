3 hours sleep max per nightI guess people are on this forum because they suffer from depression... unless there are other reasons? I am not sure.Does anyone else just lie in their bed at night crying? I get 3 hours sleep max. I go to bed at 11pm (I am just about to go before sending this!) My mother wakes up at 6am for Work. 5 days per week I am still up and crying when she is awake... I have tried everything. sleeping pills (to get me asleep and nothing else). I have tried talking to a doctor but this isn't me. I am the quietest boy in the world. During my life, I have learned myself on my own and battled through on my own. I don;'t know what to do anymore.Persistence of ThoughtEvery day, something reminds me of what it would be like if I was gone. Makes me wonder what a better place the world would be without me. Makes me think of some way I could make it look like an accident. Thoughts about me dying, and no one bothering to show up to a funeral. I just don't know how to keep myself distracted anymore. The more things I try the more I hurt myself and the more I think. It is always with me, that thought. It is always there and I can't keep pushing it away the way I have been. I need a new way to push away the thoughts, because they are growing and growing all the time, and soon I'm not quite sure I'll be able to stop them at all.So tired of thisI am at the point I can't sleep unless it's medicated and as soon as it wares off I am awake and it feel like I have been punched in the stomach, always feel so alone even if I can manage to get out which is less and less, I have nothing I want to be here for and the pain of depression is unbarable any more it is at the point I can't seem to do much, no one understands why keep it up I need to find peace soon.
