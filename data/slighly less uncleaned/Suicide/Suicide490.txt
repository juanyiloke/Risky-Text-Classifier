Tired of it allLivWhen I was born I was diagnosed with Sickle Cell Anemia. Almost every day I’m in pain. When I was little I would miss school alot but I would make up the work while I was in the hospital. Now I’m in high school and I can’t even keep up No matter what and the pain is even worse. I get hit alot by my own mother who knows how I feel. She even told me that she hates me and I was a mistake and she I was never born. I’m tired of all the pain. I don’t have any friends anymore. I’m not afraid of death because I can die at any minute because of the disease I was born with. No one understands how I feel. Not even my own family. My dad told me that people who do suicide are stupid. Since I’m thinking about it does that me stupid like them? No one cares about me, I think if I were to die there would only be one person that sheds a real tear. I’m in pain all the time from a couple of things, but I always put on this fake smile and an act so No one knows. I tried talking to people but they said “you’re only 16 you don’t know what you’re talking about.” But the truth is they just don’t understand me, so I stopped talking to them and act like nothing’s wrong. I keep everything bottled up inside and try to keep my head up and move forward but I don’t think I can do it any more. I’m ready to just die I’m sick of all the pain and misery I’m put through. I can’t keep this act up anymore.
