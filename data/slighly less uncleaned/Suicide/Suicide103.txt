cant talk to anyonewhen I feel so down and sad and lonely, all i want is to talk to someone that will understand or just listen. but i dont want them to tell me to "hold on" or "you need to let go" or 'you need to be admitted". i am so tired of hearing those words from friends when all i want is to tallk about whats bothering me and for them to just listen and maybe even offer a hug. but no, they all need to say those same old cliches and tell you its not that bad. yes i know there are people out there that are worse off than me, and i do feel for them but it doesnt make my feeling and worries any less. i so badly wanna leave this life now, its too much to keep going on and on to please others and to smile through the tears and heartache...
