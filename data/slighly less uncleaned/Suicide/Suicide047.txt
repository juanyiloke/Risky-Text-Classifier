What will happen if I tell my therapist I want to kill myself?*********TRIGGERING**********I have been planning since around June 2014 of how to do it, and now that I definitely know what I want to do, I don't know if I should tell my therapist. I have what I need, but I just need the guts to do it, I'm not 100% on it yet. My therapist does not know that I have suicidal thoughts, and I do not know when I'm seeing her next. I was just wondering...if I told her, and about my plans, would she send me to a mental hospital, or would she keep it to herself? Would she tell my mother? I know talking to a therapist is confidential unless you tell them to tell someone about what you have said, but what about in this case? I have tried EVERYTHING to get better. And it is just getting worse and worse and my sleeping and eating habits are getting worse and worse, and I am telling people things less and less.ÊI guess I am too weak to do it, so I go seeking help. >
