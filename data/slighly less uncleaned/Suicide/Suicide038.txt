getting no better...Hi everyonePosting again as I am really struggling with suicidal thoughts.I have Body Dismorphia related to having eye bags, dark circles and wrinkles.It has been triggered by my friends suicide a few months ago. I was helping her through her depression after her husband of 25 years left.She was under the crisis team and had attempted suicide previously. I was helping her as at the time I was well. I had come off the Citalopram and doing ok.Then she committed suicide and I and a couple of friends found her. I seemed to be doing okay and then 2 weeks After her funeral the body dismorphia came back with avengeance. I am now back on Citalopram, sleeping pills and valium. I have cut myself. And am 9 weeks waiting for CBT. I am drugged up and feeling like I can't go on. My partner is a wonderful man and I am killing him. He has a new job he loves and I am jeopardising this. He is so worried about me harming myself. Please help me...Hugs Sophie ? xx
