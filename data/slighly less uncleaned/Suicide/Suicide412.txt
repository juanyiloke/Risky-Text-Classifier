I can't do this anymore.k jI’m just done. No stories. No backgrounds. Some people are just here to lose no matter how hard they try. It’s the natural order. I think when you finally figure out that you’re one of them, you have an obligation to yourself to get out. What else can you expect but more of the same?No idea why I’m sharing this with you or anyone. I’ve had lots of therapy. Taken lots of medication. Worked my ass off…and I’m still a loser. I can’t stand to wake up or look at myself in the mirror and it’s just plain time to go.33 years is not a bad run.
