Broke down in therapyI had a massive breakdown in therapy today. I burst out into tears when I was describing current problems I am facing and discussing them in the group. It's the first time that I have ever got really personal in therapy as I really struggle to talk about my problems. I talk about things like my thoughts, triggers and anxiety and I always do my homework and do what they tell me and work really hard but I have never gone as deep into my problems as some of the other group members have, and even today, wasn't even the half of it. I have never felt so uncomfortable. It really hurt. I know it's supposed to but I'm a mess now. I felt really selfish for taking up everybody's time and I even said so whilst I was in tears. I felt so embarrassed and so stupid and now I feel really down about it. I know it's going to continue to get harder, and I don't know if Ive got enough in me to keep it going.
