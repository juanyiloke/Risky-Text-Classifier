Sometime lurker and in a dark placeBeen reading these forums off and on for a few months and finally decided to jpin in the discussion. Where do I start. I'm a 34 year old male, lifelong Floridian.ÊAttempted suicide three times, with many other near attempts. Nobody knows about any of the attempts except my psychiatrist. One I was able to play of as an accident. This was mostly when I was in the 17-25 age range before I sought out help. I've suffered from and was finally diagnosed with major depression and anxiety about 9 years ago when I finally got professinal help. The medications/treatment really did help but the anxiety is still there in a big way, even if reduced. The major bouts of depression still come on several times a year, sometimes due to a particular event, sometimes not.ÊI don't have a lot of friends or family to confide in due largely to my anti-social problems. Really I only have one long-time friend and he moved to Ohio recently, which has triggered a major depression and some suicidal thoughts of late. The slightest change in my life tends to trigger the dark side of me. I'm straight but more along the lines of asexual due to my many 'issues,' never having had a relationship more than a couple months and no relationships for years at a time during some spells. I'm now suffering from other health issues such as glaucoma and chronic back and wrist pain. Due to the physical pain I'm now dependent if not addicted to Vicodin. In total I'm now on 8 different prescription drugs. While they may be overall helpful they still cause side effects taking so many things. I'm just at wit's end and really see no positive long-term prospects for my life. If I thought I'd be headed to a better place (I am an atheist and don't) I probably would have ended it by now.
