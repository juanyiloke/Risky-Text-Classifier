I think I am a loserAlexI feel like I have failed at everything in life. I am just nothing but unhappy. I have severe anxiety and no money to pay for doctors. The thought of ending my life actually relaxes me. I know it’s sick but I think about jumping in front of a train and the thought makes me feel a little better. The idea that I can end my pain is a relief to me. It’s my only relief.Just sick of not being able to get any traction in life. I am a disappointment to my family and I think they could handle losing me.I am weak and tired and sad and angry and hopeless. My only hope is that when I die I will fly sway and be happy. And I will apologize to God and Jesus.
