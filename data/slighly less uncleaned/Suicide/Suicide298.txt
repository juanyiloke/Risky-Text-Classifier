Can't stop thinking about it...I've been depressed for nearly a year now and it's just progressively getting worse. I'm tired and in pain all the time and I can't concentrate on anything I used to enjoy, it's like I'm more just trying to make each day pass quicker than actually living. I've started daydreaming pretty much all the time about killing myself which just makes me feel worse.I've come to realise how unimportant I am compared to everyone else. Everyone I know seems to be surrounded by people who love them but I don't think there's anyone outside of my immediate family who would care if I was gone. There's something just wrong with me...I don't even want to die, I just desperately want to be someone else.I've tried to get treatment but it doesn't seem to be working. CBT can't prove to me that I'm worth anything and everything I've read about medication has made me think it's not worth it. When I've been depressed before it just passed on it's own so my only hope is that that happens againNo point in existing anymoreI don't seem to have any positive affect on anyone's life. There's people who care about me but all I do is make them worry and become unhappy. I know that even killing myself would just be another way i'dhurt them. I wish i could just disappear without anyone noticing. I could actually do that with my friends because I'm kinda forgettable and no one really starts conversations with me but my family would contact me eventually then everyone else would find out. It seems there's nothing I can do but hurt people so why do I even exist? My depression isn't going away and all I can think about is killing myself. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore
