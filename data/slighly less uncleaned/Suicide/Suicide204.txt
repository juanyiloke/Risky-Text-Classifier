Stuck between a rock and a hard place.Literally, the only thing keeping me going is my pride.At this moment in time my pride won't let me kill myself because I don't want the people I leave behind to think I was weak but my pride won't let me take medication for my various disorders or claim disability.However I have done extensive research on CBT and DBT techniques. I'm too fucked up to live a normal life but I'm sane enough to realize just how different I am when I'm with other people and envision the kind of life I could of had if things were slightly different.For the next couple next months it really is make or break time so to speak. I am literally willing to clean toilets in order to start making a bit of money again (I've lost count of the number of cleaning jobs I've applied for)Every man has his breaking point, I think I may be very close to mine.
