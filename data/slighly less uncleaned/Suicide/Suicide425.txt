FlashbacksSuicide_girl24Anyone out there have flashbacks? Well I do they suck I break down in tears and I can’t stop them they just keep going and going until it drives me off the bridge and I cut and I am not quite sure my mom cares… I haven’t seen my step mom since I was 2 and I just want to leave this world.. My real mom never did have a care in the world for me and my step dad is all trouble he bullies me even when I’m not even there. He will call me up call me worthless and other mean shit. My flashbacks mostly consume of my childhood when I use to live with my asswhole of a dad. He was a sick man that wanted to have sex with any human that had a vagina and boobs yeah so pretty much every female is fucked… I also see the first time I tried to commit suicide that’s when my step mom came all she did was hold me and prayed for me to wake up and I didn’t… She finally went home after saying goodbye to my biological mother… I woke up 10 minutes after she left and I got a letter from her in the mail at the hospital I was at… Well I wouldn’t call it a letter I’d call it a suicide note. I tried calling her over and over again my real mom wasn’t there either so I signed my paper work and left to go home to an empty house. I was driving myself insane that day because no one was there but me so I finally went to see my mom and my step dad and once he touched my it shot me back into a flashback when he first raped me so help me God to think it was the end…
