ÊI want to die, but not suicidal. ConfusingI want to die, but not suicidal. I just feel that dying is so much easier and better than living. Right now, I want to go to bed, and if I don't wake up (i.e., have a massive heart attack or whatever), I honestly would not care. If I wake up, it's another agonizing day. Ironically, life is a temporary death sentence for me. I'm just tired of trying to reach my goals, only to have them dashed because of other people. I just hate it.ÊIs it confusing to actually want to die but not be suicidal? Basically, I feel that if someone broke into my house and threatened to kill me, I would honestly take it.
