What do I do?KarlieLets see. Everything hurts – literally everything. I get regular gastric pains, my heart clenches every time I exercise, my headaches are so common that it happens nearly everyday and my kidneys squeeze; the pain is tremendous but my whole family thinks I’m fine because I’ve gotten so good at hiding the pain and faking a smile. I try to always make other people laugh, I always try to smile but when I’m at home, I just break down. I completely break down. Looking at the bright side is hard to do when you have a sister that wants you dead. Everyday she tells me to go kill myself. That I’m useless, worthless, a f**king brat, and that no one would care when I’m gone. I’m starting to believe her. I see no point in living anymore. I just want to die. I’m trying to live, but sometimes I just can’t help it. What do I do?
