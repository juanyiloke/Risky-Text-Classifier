Don't understand how people can be like thisHi all.First time posting here. I think the only thing stopping me from throwing in the towel are my niece and nephews. I don't want them to suffer from me not being around. Ihelp a lot with the kids, both physically and emotionally and we love being around each other, so that seems to be the only thing holding me back. On the other hand, I'm so tired of thinking. I can't do this anymore. I wish there was a pill one could take to stop thinking altogether. There's only one way I can think of to stop thinking, and I'm well on my way to taking the leap. I've been thinking about all the different ways I can do it so that it has the less possible impact on my family.I can't live with the fact that people are fake and say things just for the sake of saying it. Recently I met this woman and got very interested in her. We started getting to know each other and eventually we were telling each other things and saying things to each other that people in relationships would say. Things like I miss you, you are special to me, we have a special bond, I love how you make me feel. Then out of the blue it stops. Now we are reduced down to 1 message a day if I'm lucky. I believe she said all of those things to get me to like her and when she realised I did like her and she was liking me just as much back, she cut it off. So I don't understand. Why say things to another human being and then stop saying them? It makes me feel like I've been played and I hate that because I don't do that. How can someone do that? I've lost all hope in humanity. The only way I can think of to not trust anyone again is to just not be around for it to happen. So for now I'll keep thinking of ways to do it. I've tried a few things before, obviously it never worked. My ex-girlfriend used to make fun of me for trying to end my life and not succeeding. I just can't do this anymore.Thanks for reading if you did
