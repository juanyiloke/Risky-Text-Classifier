I'd commit suicide but I have too much to doI have ECT every 2 weeks and lately it doesn't seem to be working. I see my psychiatrist when I get ECT, but am only able to say I'm doing "good thank you". I haven't had an appt with him since November of 2014. My Dr is so nice I hate to tell him I am struggling again. I am thinking about suicide all the time again and have stocked up enough meds to make a real attempt, but I'm too damn busy and responsible. I am busy at my job. I have a lot of responsibility to my family (MIL lives with us). I hate everything, myself, my life, my future......everything.Thank you for listening.
