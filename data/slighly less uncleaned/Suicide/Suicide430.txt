looking for suicide partner on oregon coastjayisreadytodieHey there…I am a 45 yr old guy with no hope left. I have some chronic conditions that make life absolutely miserable to live. No dr or medications have been helpful and it has ruined any chances for healing my relationship. My partner tells me everyday what a loser am and I believe him! He wants me gone and I really dont want to be here either. I have no family left worth getting in contact with and no friends around that could even remotely understand what hell I live in.All I have left in this life after losing most everything….jobs, car, etc….is my sweet little dog. He will be so sad after I am gone, but its just not enough to make me want to go on.I want so badly to find a suicide partner on the oregon coast who is as serious as I am about ending a miserable existence. I have no faith left in people and know there cant be a god who would allow his subjects so much suffering and misery. Please get in touch with me if you are serious and for real! (503) 894-0072
