Feeling like I have no purpose and could never be happyfeeling worthlessHi all,I am 24 years old and I have been in a relationship with a man for 5 years. After the first 2 months I found out that I was not the first person he was seeing. It hurt like hell because this was the first thing I experienced a pain like deceit.One day while hanging out with friends he hugged me for the first time. There was a moment of silence, cold breeze passed through my hair I felt like my heart stopped beating for a second. From there we hit it off. Felt so perfect until 2 months after.He was with that girl for more than a tear while he was with me. Lied to me over an over but I was blinded by love. Then he left her and told her in front of me that he wants to be with me because he is in love with me. Some months after he cheated on me again and again.After 3 years the cheating stopped but he kept talking to women and flirting. Until we broke up for Christmas last year and he beat me. I left and tried to move on.He came back into my life. He is still hurting me with insults and making me feel worthless and lifeless when all I have been fighting for is happiness. But I cant be happy with him nor without him.what do I do? I am fed up of life and I cant take it anymore. I am trapped.Help me please.
