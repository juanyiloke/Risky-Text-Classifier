I have no one to talk to, just need 1 person to listen.Ive been depressed since high school. im now a junior in college. i feel like a failure. nothing i do ever turns out right. no matter how hard i try to do things right and get ahead its like the universe has to slap me back down. i think my parents are the main cause. theyre so controlling and overprotective and close minded. 1 example being, i had the most miserable high school experience. i wasnt allowed to do anything. i had my 1st kiss in 9th grade and what, i thought, was a momentous occasion in a young girls life my mother turned into the worst memory. i lost all privileges for all 4 years all due to 1 kiss. my mother still brings it up to embarrass me. anytime i had any kind of relationship with a boy i had to keep it a secret in fear of my parents finding out and today years later they still judge me from past mistakes. i look at my friends and long for the type of relationships they have with their parents. im 21 and they still continue to control my life. they are so non supportive and manipulating it drives me insane. i try so hard in school and i just dont have anything to show for it because when i try to get motivated my depression over powers it. im such a good person but i feel like i cant catch a break sometimes, im a christian and pray heavily but its like everything i pray for, i get the opposite. i just hate waking up everyday knowing what i have to deal with, i cant see anything in the future to look forward to and feel so completely alone. i think of suicide often just because being at peace would be so much better than having to deal with being a failure. sometimes i just dont feel loved at all. tonight i looked up painless suicide methods. im trying to be strong but it gets harder and harder everyday.
