Trying to get help is making me even more suicidal.I am not sure where to start anymore. I had set up a meeting over 4 weeks ago, i missed my first appointment by accident. But today i went into the new one and i am stuck with a previous therapist who is a snarky cow who doesn't listen to anything i say at all.I was telling her i cant remember any dates/years as my memory is bad but she kept insisting on me saying something. When it come to the medications i said one made me dazing and have weird side effects but i wasn't driving at the time of taking them as i had moved for school but she insisted that i should have had my drivers license revoked and should have been allowed to drive or do anything.I Told the other case manager that i want to have a different therapist as i don't like her, but Oh no he said oh give her a chance etc etc. This is a COMPLETE repeat of what happened last time and it ruined me.For now they want to set a meeting up with my parents to talk to them to discuss, so i am going to go in tomorrow and try get a new therapist. If nothing is going to change then i have no idea what to do anymore.After the appointment i come out more suicidal then ever, rung my parents to let them know what is happening and that i will try get a new therapist and if i don't i will stop getting help.Suicide seems like my only option atm as school has been going to bad for me as well
