just something i wanted to writethatoneguyI’m scared , terrified actually of people. i guess iv been fucked up since i was a child , my mother was a whore and she had a lot of boyfriends weird guys that i hated. i would be up all night because it was so loud in the next room i was always sleep deprived and i was always being moved from house to house because i would spend the weekends at my fathers and my mother was always moving somewhere new. i matured quickly i was already interested in girls way before i knew what sex was before any of that stuff. as i got older my dad remarried my abusive stepmother and had another 2 children and even thou it was hell at home i think this was the best part of my life because i figured out how to act , kids in my new school thought i was funny and i loved acting out to get attention but it was all fake i was always pretending to have fun pretending i had a normal family and pretending i wasn’t scared of the world. I had friends for the first time in my life and they where not so bad (i was also taking medication for my adhd so that might tie into some of this) , but secretly i hated most other people its shameful to write this but i was so envious of them and what they had that over time i distanced myself from them and for the first time i was considering suicide seriously . The first year of high school destroyed my hope for something better i was constantly berated and i developed my fear of people further which just got worse and worse i was stuttering and sweating when i talked to someone and i cant be near groups of people i always sat at the back of class and pretended to be reading and i would stay locked in my room at home. all i wanted and all i prayed for was to be perfectly honest a lover , i hadent ever kissed a girl and (FUCK THIS IS HARD TO WRITE ABOUT) i had been into porn and hentai even some of the weirder stuff since i discovered the internet so way before i can actually remember, but i had never actually had a relationship or any kind of extended contact with a girl and that dident change for a while. from grade 9 to the first semester of grade 12 i slept, no i know it sounds weird but i slept an unhealthy amount and i saw my doctor about it as well but i dident really care i also stared smoking weed and other thing but quickly stopped because i would have to talk to the dealers , i would sleep in everyone of my classes and then go home and sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning.then something really weird happened in the last class of my last semester in high school i sat beside a girl named Erika i quickly fell in love with her she was the most beautiful and talented person i had ever met , we almost never spoke at the start i would just say hello as i got to class and say goodbye as i left the school but it changed me so much being in love with her i was able to do things i wasent able to to before like stay awake in class and talk to people. i was able to smile as i walked home and my sleeping scheduled quickly became a normal one, i felt good for honestly the first time i could remember and as the end of the semester came i built up the courage and asked her to go to prom with me and she said no and told me she was already in a relationship with someone else. you might think i was crushed by something like that but i was fine but later that night she messaged me on my my phone and said she did want to go with me(I STILL DONT GET GIRLS).we stared talking more and even went on a few dates before prom and at the dinner during prom i met her friends and they where nice (goddammit this is hard) and we danced and as we danced she looked at me (FUCK IM IN TEARS) and she gave me the most peculiar look iv ever seen and she told me she loved me (it felt like someone hitting me over the head with a sledge hammer).i hate myself so much. i told her i didnt and i went outside for a bit before comeing back in. later it was awkward and i apologized i had no idea what i had done or why i had done it but we already had a hotel booked for the night me and Erika where the first the prom area and at the hotel we drank A LOT and i asked her to kiss me and she did and it dident feel like anything, at this point i had been thinking about this stuff almost all my life imagining and fantasizing what kissing a girl feels like but it dident feel like anything just lips against lips and a tongue in my mouth and i was visibly stunned.clearly upset about my reaction she asked me what was wrong and i just kissed her again.im so sorry. that night even thou we slept in the same bed we dident sleep together and we parted in the morning later i was able to tell her i loved her aswell but it was to late . SHE BROKE UP WITH ME OVER STEAM FORGODSAKE NOT EVEN A FUCKING TEXT GODDAMIT FUCK.im trashand just like that i was alone again , terrified of people again and much worse for wear hating myself , cutting myself because im a fucking idiot coward , i took a year off in between high school and collage just to figure out what the fuck im doing .im 18 now soon to be 19 and im still thinking about Erika everyday and thinking about suicide everyday and i just wanted to get my story off my chest for a bit.
