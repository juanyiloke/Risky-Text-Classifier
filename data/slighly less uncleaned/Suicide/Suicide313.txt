There is nothing leftI don't see any reason to live at all, and the tiny shreds of hope that I had have been recently taken away, so what's the point now to even bother???I know, I know I'm not supposed to talk about faith in the general forum, but I feel I've been fooled by someone that I thought was of high true faith, and that was really all I was hanging on to. This has hurt me to my very core that I was being fooled by a "fake", and I have no idea on just how to carry on now. Even realizing this recent hurtful 99.99% possibility, I still feel I'm being protected by my faith (being oh so careful with my wording here).ÊHowever, If things don't turn around for me over the next few months, I'm just done, and will be putting and end to this miserable existence. I have no interest to call a hotline, and don't want to be hospitalized (again), because all I do is bullshit my way out when I realize there really is no help for some people with certain types of mental illness.ÊNow, I'm questioning weather or not I'm in in fact a religious wacko. I don't not like myself, and this is because I don't feel I live up to what my fait requires. I just don't know how to be "without faith" (again careful wording), or practice hedonism. My pleasures is by showing love to others, and this is in conflict with seeking pleasure for myself.ÊI have no idea even why I'm creating this thread, because there isn't much anybody could tell me right now to make me feel much differently about my situations.ÊI've just had it.
