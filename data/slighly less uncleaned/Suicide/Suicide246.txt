lone wolf sectionedI am all alone. I don't have a single friend left. I long for human connection, it makes me so sad. I still feel pain from the past. When will my life change.ÊI have nearly been out of work for three years. My story is too complicated to go in to now. My most recent suicide attempt was last year i n hospital I escaped the psyche ward and stood on the roof. I was sectioned for six months.ÊI want to drink myself into oblivion. Despair, desolate. Empty. Insignificance. I wish I were someone else.
