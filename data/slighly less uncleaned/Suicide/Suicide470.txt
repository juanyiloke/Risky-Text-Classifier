depression & lonelinesschristyI m born in a happy family.. Parents r too gud. Have a bf of othr religion. Want to marry him becoz i cnt live widout him.. Once gained courage n told mom but she started crying by saying i broke her trust so i told her tht I’ll end my relatnshp.. Bt still I’m in it.. I’ve decided nvr to marry othr guy only to see my parents happy.. But today i just asked mom not to go college as tomorrow there’s a test so I’ve to prepare for it n she rudely answered do wt to like i dnt care. She also told if i dnt get vacatn becoz of less attndnc then she dnt care. I used to ask each n evrthng to her. I live in hstl n she calls me 15 tyms a day n i tell her every detail. I miss her so much. Then if I’m doing this much for her then y she talks so rudely for a simple thing. Its not the first tym… Evrytym it happens with me.. Then wats the rsn to b alive
