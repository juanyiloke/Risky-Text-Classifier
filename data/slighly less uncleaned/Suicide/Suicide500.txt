He left me and I CANT live without himbhawna SinghI am 26.I have decided to die soon. I know its a bad thing but I CANT bear this pain anymore. He is a Nice guy. He loved me I guess but he doesnt understand me. Family comes first then etc etc he always forgot that I am here. Everytime we fight for silly reason he breaks up with me. This time he Blocked me from every social site I CANT contact him as he is abroad now. He doesnt care about my feelings I love him so much. The reason I am committing suicide is that he was the only one only reason I am living for and he knows that. He was m family. I am alone. He was the only love of my life. My first and last too. I love you janu
