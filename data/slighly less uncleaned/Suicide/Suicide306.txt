ÊI don't want to live anymoreHello, I am also schizoaffective. I am only 26, yet already after 10 years of in and out of psychosis they probably will give me a disability pension which means soon I will be disabled for real lol... I am just existing and I cry every day. My concentration is gone so I cant read books or watch movies, i feel no joy, no happiness, only a chronic headache that was added to my symptom list 4 months ago and I really hope it is a brain tumor. I fantasize about it being a brain tumor. If it's not i will probably end up with tardivde dyskinesia too in a matter of time. Life sucks. I wonder how long it will take, waiting it out. When will I get cancer, or a heart attack? Will I have the chance to refuse treatment for for example breast cancer at 34, or do I have to endure this state I am in for 50 years? I long for a quick fix too, every day, my thoughts are really one track minded and it makes me cry, i am lonely and it makes me cry, i have to to escape to my mothers for emotional support i cant be alone more than a few days whithout psychosomatic pain building up. I do have stronger independent periods but if they last 3 months, the apathic depressed period lasts 8 months, so most time I'm having a hard time. My doctors think im going to be okay. Can you beleive it. I want them to be wrong I dont want to live anymore, no more struggle now.
