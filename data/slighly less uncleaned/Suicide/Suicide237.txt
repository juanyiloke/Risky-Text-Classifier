Im back, and i need friendsOctober 28th, 2014 was the last attempt i made. i posted here saying i had a notebook and that when it was full i would kill myself. well i filled it. i spent around 10pages doing letters then i used the rest to write "im sorry". I rummaged through my friends room for something I could use, found it, and couldnt do it. called the hotline, kept me safe. i promptly moved out.this was after i pretty much threw away a budding relationship.I have started to try and talk to her again, trying to get back what we had, but pretty much am back to square one.those closest to me i cant even trust anymore. anytime i vent out to them i get "just be happy spencer, just gotta get through it" and i have no support system anymore.ÊI feel lost, and these thoughts wont stop anymore. i thought i was doing so much better but it feels like anything minor can set off a suicidal thought spree.Êim scared, guys.
