So tiredI physically feel ill sick in my stomach bad diahreah on an almost daily I lie to survive and totally isolate, I've managed to get into so much of a mess with debt that it consumes my whole being I don't see a way forward it's not my debt but I'm in charge of my dad's money I've let him down so badly my partner has no idea he'll probably just leave but we live like brother and sister anyway, I wake up and take my pain meds after several surgeries in my back then I'm really shaky I try and save up my meds till the night so I can at least sleep my turmoil with throwing in the towel is I have 2 sons 19 and 29 the thought of hurting them brings another heap of guilt shame, but the thought of being found out and waiting for every letter call to say this is it pulls me to such a dark place, I'm so good at supporting others with housing/forms appointments ect. Yet I can not reach out to stop this mess.
