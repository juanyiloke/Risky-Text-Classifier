What if I fail?SanjanaI just gave my HSC and I’m worried I might fail. I already got selected to a good art college but it requires minimum 50%. I was arrogant and didn’t want to be considered ‘good for nothing’ so I choose science stream after 10th grade. I was good enough in 11th but I started deteriorating in 12th and now I’m worried I might fail. I have nothing to actually live for. My parents have given me everything and I’m worried I might let them down. I won’t be able to live with the guilt. Also the fees for the art college are humongous, it’ll also save them the expenditure. Technically if I fail, I will become ‘good for nothing’ just like my fear.
