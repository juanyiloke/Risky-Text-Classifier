What do I even do anymore?Things have been getting worse year by year. This time last year I remember telling myself "wow things can't POSSIBLY get any worse than this" and they did.ÊI'm 25 and:- no proper career established- single- no real friendships- suffering from HAIR LOSS as a female! I might as well be dead.Ê- living at home because I've wasted the past few years of my life at school- no money of my own since I have to pay for my own tuition since my family is poor- POORÊJust fuck my life. 5 years ago I thought I was turning my life around and setting it in the proper direction to enjoy my 20s. I've enjoyed 1 year of my 20s (at 20), liked 2 years (at 21 and 23) and have been miserable for the rest. It's a compounding effect. I have no money so I wasted my life studying for impossible goals so I ended up stressed and lost my hair so I ended up not going out much and losing my friends, etc. And then to make matters worse my friends all thing I'm "negative"...I mean I'm suffering from depression and want to kill myself, am I supposed to be positive? But I opened up about something that's very personal to me (the hair loss) to a friend who I thought would understand and I told her that year after year I feel like I'm losing things I love about myself and my life and I can't go on like this. All she told me is to stop being so negative and then when I replied to her she saw the message but didn't bother to reply back or contact me for a week. I just let it go...I mean who really needs friends?All I see is all these people on instagram having an amazing life with nothing that seems to be wrong while I'm here depressed with every aspect of my life in a complete mess. This hair loss struggle is the last straw for me. It's been falling out for the last 6 months. I'd rather die before more hair falls out. Like I'm already struggling with enough shit did I REALLY need another thing to hate about myself and my life on top of it?
