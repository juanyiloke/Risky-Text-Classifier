Life just isn't enjoyableI've been really struggling to fight against my suicidal thoughts these past couple months but I can't really see the point anymore. My life just isn't worth living: I'm not a very good or interesting person, socially I'm pretty much invisible, I can't get a job, my grades in uni are dropping and I'm in love with my best friend. Why bother fighting to keep that?I think the only reason I've stayed alive are an existential fear of being dead and the knowledge that my suicide would really harm the few people that care about me. I guess what I wish is that I could just cease to exist and wake up tomorrow as an entirely different person but, with that being impossible, suicide seems to be the only logical conclusion to this right now...Â My life,i want end with itWell,hi.On start i want to say sorry to you guys for my english.I lost all my faith in pepole,and love.Everyone in environment keep tease me,flaming for no reason...nobody react to this,teachers,family,and other pepole.Even my ex-girls destroy me from inside.I was 3 times betrayed.My last relationship looks like i doing everything for her..she was playing with me.My love to her was used to her purposes.I trying so hard to forgot about past but it's so hard...I can't trust nobody,nobody want's help me nobody even tryied.I lost my friends cuz of my ex.She told them how bad I'm etc... I'm left to myself. It's so hard to me...I need someone who help or I don't be on this world too much..Sorry for my English,im in tears when i typping it.
