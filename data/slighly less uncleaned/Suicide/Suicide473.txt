Biggest mistake with the biggest jerkUnderstanding FriendI did something I shouldn’t have with a guy I knew was wrong. He had already cheated on me and convinced me that it was my fault. I know I shouldn’t have been with him in the first place but he said we were just gonna talk. He cheated on his gf with me and I felt terrible. I didn’t even know he was still dating her. Everyone hates me for being the other girl, but when he cheated on me with her no one seemed to care. As bad as it seems I can’t say I regret it. He made me feel like someone cared again and I loved that feeling. Now all of my friends hate me and say I should not have been the other girl. I had just talked myself out of suicide but it’s all starting again. I guess that’s why you never do anything at school and never let anyone else know.
