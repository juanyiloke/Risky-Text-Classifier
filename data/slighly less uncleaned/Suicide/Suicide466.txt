when will i ever stop having suicidal thoughtsmWhats frustrating is that I always come back to these dark thoughts. I can never get rid of them. I go months feeling great and then BOOM something happens and I feel worthless and insignificant and just tiresome of trying so hard to be loved and accepted. It just always comes back to a feeling of feeling like I dont have a place to fit in, in this world. I always wonder why my mom wouldnt have just aborted me instead of putting me up for adoption. Dont get me wrong, my adoptive parents were great, well my mom was, but I just dont seem to have a place to call home or that I fit in. Even in my adoptive family, they dont understand me nor do they acknowledge or validate any feelings I ever had about my feelings of insecurity or feeling different. Even the fact that I am a different race than my adoptive family, was ever acknowledged. They didnt see me any different, therefore, I am not. I just want to find a place to call home, so to speak. I feel so alone.
