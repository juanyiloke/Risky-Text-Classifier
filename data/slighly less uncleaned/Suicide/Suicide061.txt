Designing my gravestone...Hello. I know i may sound funny or something, I find it some sarcastic way very funny (Im many times very sarcastic in many ways). But last night like between 2 and 3 am I started to design my own gravestone in the internet. I was looking different kind of stonetypes, thinking what font Id like to have on it, what picture, what text etc. Been feeling very depressed lately ,and today was the top of the mountain. I dropped into that deep ocean , which is full of pain, agony, grief, sadness, loneliness, depressiion, hate etc. I have some friends, but no one to talk about these hard feelings. I also find hard to talk things in their "own names": usually I pretend its all ok until it goes to that point I attempt to kill myself. Have many attempts behind me.ÊSo I tried to get some help , say somehow please somebody help me. I shared the gravestone pic on my facebook profile and the tex id like to have it when I die. Three people liked it, and one people asked what is it. I said im having deep pain and agony. No answer. I think this speaks about my loneliness. So I left my home for a walk, couldn breathe here. I had this thought im just going to walk as far as I can and never returning. So i kept on walking, and the deepest pain started to ease. I dont have any saldo so I cant call on the crisis phone.ÊIm 28-years-old. People dont believe me , when I say I feel much older and that my life is over. Been feeling this way for years, also when im not feeling suicidal. I just feel Ive seen it all, the bad things yes but also the good things. Many good things, nice people and good memories. Its not all just shit. But this pain is hard to cope with.ÊI took the gravestone picture away from my fb wall, it was there several ours. this is the text id like to have on it, its from Flipsydes song "Someday" which I find speaking directly about my life :
