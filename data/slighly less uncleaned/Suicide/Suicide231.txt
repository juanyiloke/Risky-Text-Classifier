ÊJust so you know...Everyday I have a suicidal thought. I know I will never act on it but I always think about it. The fear of hurting my family is what stops me. But I feel like everything has drained out of me. No job no friends nothing..I feel like I'll never get that big break. My nephew just turned one two months ago. I fear that as he gets older hes going to always see his lame pathetic loser uncle still living in his grandmas house. That makes me feel ashamed of myself.Maybe I'm not trying hard enough but I feel so damn weak to make that big of an effort. It seems so hard of a task to get out there and really apply myself. I rather just live in a different world where I don't have to worry about surviving. I feel like I'm living in the grey. I feel like I'm not worth living..I feel like curling up everynight in my bed. Sometimes I feel like I want to sleep during the day. I've tried therapy in the past and seeing a psychiatrist but making the appointments and having the sessions were stressful I felt better staying home. But it's killing me. I miss working and I don't miss working. I just want to be comfortable and know that I will surive.Ê
