Desperately wanting to dieI'm so broken and I am unable to bear the heartache of rejection anymore. i just NEED to die.My beautiful girlfriend has abandoned me. She says she cares but her actions show that she doesn't even give me a passing thought. Yet we were perfect together and she told me she had never been so sure of anything than of her love for me. The look in her eyes said she wasn't lying. And yet now...I'm always there for other people, I was there for her when she felt down. But there's just no-one there for me. I don't want pity. Just to die and stop all this crying and heartache. I just want it to stop
