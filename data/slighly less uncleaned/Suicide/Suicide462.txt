Will it be that bad if I died?lineI am a 16 – soon 17 year old girl. I live with my grandma because my mother has a depression and have had that for around 10 years. My dad is an alcoholic and I have no contact with him.For 10 years have I kept the secret that I have OCD and I’m bipolar. I finally told my family 7 mounts ago, but they think everything is ok after I told them – but nothing is okay.I’m struggling with my disorders and cutting. I’m having a really hard time and I’m so close to giving up, and the only thing there stops me is my family. Today I thought for the first time: Would it really be so bad if I died? I’m living a life where I can’t handle school and the small tasks of a normal day – I mean I’m not doing anything? What am I living my life for? Nothing – so I cold just as well end it all now. My family will probably miss me but they’ll get over it. What would happen if I died? Would it be that bad?
