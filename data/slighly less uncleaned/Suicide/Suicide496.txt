About to give upKrb1982I’ve made many mistakes in my life. Some still haunt me to this day. Things I will never be able to change. I have very little going for me anymore. Everyday life is getting harder and harder to bear. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore. Food has no taste,love feels empty, and my once joy filled career now feels like a never ending purgatory. I often daydream about it. The end. The slipping away into nothingness. Closing my eyes for the last time. Never having to deal with the pain, the stress, the heartache, the darkness that has consumed my shit hole of an existence. I think i would prefer a gunshot. Something quick. Also, the bag over the head mixed with some sort of sedative…either of those will do.
