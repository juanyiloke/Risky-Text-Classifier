I feel like a financial burden and it's making me suicidalI graduated college a few years ago. But long story short, I missed the boat as far as getting a career is concerned. As a result, my parents are still supporting me financially.Anyway, this feeling of being a financial burden on my family has given me suicidal thoughts. My parents do well for themselves financially and are totally able and willing to support me. But that's not the point. I still feel like a failure for depending on my parents at my age. And I doubt things will get better. The economic outlook isn't looking good for my generation. Some people call us the lost generation.My parents have worked hard their whole life. And now they're approaching retirement age. Even if they have the money to support me, they deserve better during their golden years. They deserve to spend their money on themselves. They deserve better than having to waste their money supporting their failure of a child.But however big of a financial burden I am on my parents, the emotional burden on my parents if I took my life would be way bigger. So it looks like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. Whether I live or die, I'm going to be some type of burden on my parents. The only question is would I rather be a financial burden or an emotional burden.I'm not going to take my life in the immediate future. But I'm at a loss for what I should do.
