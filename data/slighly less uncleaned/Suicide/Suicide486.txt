how to die during surgery?spasticAnyone knows what I can do/take to make sure I don’t wake up from general anaesthesia? Someone said taking barbiturates might add to dthe possibility of death during anaesthesia. I can’t be bothered with myself and life any more but I love my wife and my family, don’t want to hurt them with the fact I decided to kill myself, they won’t understand and I am not into causing unnecessary pain if it can be avoided. Death during my heart surgery next week seems like a a fantastic opportunity to sneak away from all this shit we live in. I am not scared of pai of suffering physical agony through self destruction but I rather make it look as unspectacular as possible…Cheers
