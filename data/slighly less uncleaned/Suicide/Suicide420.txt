Tired of stupid reasons to continue, tired of being tired of it all.JohnHow often have I been given a stupid list of reasons to keep living? I’ve lost count. Just asked if I’m religious because many religious people think it’s a sin to commit suicide. So it’s ok if you get killed, or die from some horrible illness. Hmmm sounds great. Much easier for the family. That’s what it really boils down to isn’t it? It’s bad for the family, the need you, they depend on you, they love you. They, they they. I bet most normal people live because they enjoy it, they love life and themselves. Bet too many of them, family included, don’t give a damn about others, they want me alive because of any negative effect sucide would have on them.Ok, maybe someone will miss me, feel bad about my death. Great, but they’ll get over it.I am sure that people kill themselves all the time because they reached their limit of pain tolerance, or before cancer or aids or a number of no cure afflictions takes them in some horrible way. And we all think that’s ok. We understand. They didn’t want to burden their family with insane medical bills, they lost almost all function, they were almost a vegetable.So I’m a burden to me, I’ve lost the ability to do anything but sit and stare at the walls, I’ve lost the few smiles, the little joy I had.I just so damn tired.
