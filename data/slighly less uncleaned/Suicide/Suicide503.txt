thing about taking my own life awaymelissa wI have been dealing with depression since I was 15 years old. I have a very large family, I don’t really have friends that I can call friends. The family that I do have treats me like I’m invisible. I have been on many different anti depressants. I’m currently on zolfolt. I take pain killers to ease my pain emotionally. I have severe anxiety. My family acts like high school students making fun of me. the only thing keeping me here is my niece and nephew who I love more then anything.
