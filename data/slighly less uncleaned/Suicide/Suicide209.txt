I've been unhappy for a long time.I am in my forties. I've been unhappy with life since I was around 12; I just didn't feel like I fit into this world, had little confidence in myself. My social life has never been stellar either. Fast forward to now. The way I feel about existence hasn't changed, but now I have the added bonus of a chronic illness which leaves me tired all the time. So I have to face this world that I hate with little energy. If anything, I have more reason to leave.There is the issue of courage though. I just don't have it- yet. But damn I hate being alive. I hate everyday.
