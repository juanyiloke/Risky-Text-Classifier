Not too sure.I wasn't sure where to turn to, so I googled forums and this one came up. So hello there. I just recently turned 28, I work full time have an amazing therapist, but no real fulfillment in my life. I was also diagnosed with a benign brain tumor last year and since then my quality of life has gone downhill fast. It's hard to keep up with my job as the medicine I take makes me sick, but if i don't take it, I'm just as sick and run the risk of the tumor getting larger. I'm sick all of the time, it gets so frustrating. Since I 'look' well, most people think I'm just whining all of the time. i know that I will never get better, so the idea of living with this sickness forever makes the future seem a bit dark and pointless, of course there is no one I can say that to.I don't have a family, I have a roommate and a couple of friends, and that's it, so I know I wouldn't be leaving too much behind. It's just scary, that my mind has gotten to be like this.I try every day to fight this, to hold on, I'm just getting so tired.ÊAnyone else ever feel like this?Well wishes to all
