Mother's Day Makes Me Suicidal...So I couldn't even tell my Mom "Happy Mother's day" because every year I always feel guilty about not being able to do enough for her. I suffer from a disability that prevents me from doing more elaborate things like taking her out to dinner or breakfast. I can't hold a job because of this disability. So I can't buy her anything. Every year it's the same thing. I just end up making her a card and she seems to appreciate it, but it's just not enough to me. I always have to watch my other guy friends do much better stuff for their Moms. I couldn't tell her "Happy Mother's day" yesterday because just saying the words would remind me of why I can't do anything for her. Just saying it would make me feel suicidal and want to kill myself because I feel like I'm not a good enough son for her. I put the words inside of a card but I had to force myself to do that. I just feel ashamed. She does so much for me and I can't do as much for her. She's the main reason why I'm suicidal...because I feel like she deserves better and if I can't give her that as a son why should I live?
