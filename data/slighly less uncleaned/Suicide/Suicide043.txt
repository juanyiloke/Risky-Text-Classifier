I Dont Think I Can Go On Like This AnymoreI'm 17 years old. I dropped out of high school back in October due to the fact that I was suffering from depression and anxiety, which I still am. I have always tried to fit in at school but I never really did. I have very few friends which I don't know if I can call them friends. I don't have a social life, never really did. I mainly stay at home. I don't play any sports because I suck at them. My life got a little easier but every time I try to make one step forward I get thrown 10 steps back. I was put in a institution for my depression and anxiety in February for a week. When I got out I was feeling a little better about everything. Now my mom has cancer which it's only in stage one right now. And I feel extremely bad because we never had a great relationship. My father was never in my life. I guess that's another thing that's bothering me . I don't really know who I am anymore I always put in a show to act like I had a okay life but that wall was distroyed in October. I've been going downhill since then. I have had several girlfriends since December. Those relationships didn't last all that long. So I guess it's not a relationship. But basically I feel like I don't have anyone I'm hopeless and I feel like I'm worthless and that I have nothing going for myself. I feel like I'm never going to be able to be in a real relationship with a girl. I feel like no girl would want to be with me since I have nothing going for myself or since I don't have a social life. I'm honestly afraid for people to see the things that I'm going through which I have told my ex at the time which she has some problems of her own but now I'm staying to myself I pretty much isolated myself from the world. I'm just going through a lot P.s I'm sorry if it's all over the place this is the first time I have been on here and I just don't really no what to say.
