Being dragged back to suicidal thoughtsI'm going to talk a little bit about why I feel this way, it's not something I usually tell anyone.Most people do not understand how stressful it is for me, school and all, it's because when I was in 8th grade, I attempted to suicide, that was a really hard time for me, I switched schools after that in 9th grade and being bullied there made me lose it again, in that same year I tried to kill myself so my parents let me skip that one year, the next year I could switch schools. I hadn't recovered from it, no one was of much help in my family, they started to take it lightly, even though I harmed myself very often then, that year, I failed to pass my final exams and because my parents didn't sign this form that was suppose to save my school year, I had to repeat that grade again and of course i switched schools, that year they told me I'd be kicked out of the school if I failed and I would have to give my exams privately. This year, I'm suppose to start 11th grade but I failed two of my exams of 10th grade so I have to give a retest, but the thing is, there's too much of a fear of failure, people don't get how hard it is when you've missed so many years because of your depression and all the people you know of, only mock you for it, and my parents have already given up on me, they say that I will end up somewhere, and they never hear if I did good on a test or anything, they're never happy, but that's okay, I understand that they're ashamed to have me, I hear it everyday. Its my fault though, I'm too discouraged to study, too afraid, if I happen to fail now, I'll surely kill myself and that is my final decision.
