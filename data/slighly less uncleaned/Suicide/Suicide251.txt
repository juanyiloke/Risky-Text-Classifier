16 year old with mental issuesHey guys, I am a 16 years old, I have been depressed for a very long time my issues vary from being insecure about my physical appearance to fearing my ability to do something would be lost, every time I feel down I contemplate suicide but don't have the guts to do it. Today is probably my worst, this is going to sound stupid but here goes... I am drawing a piece of art which is for my GCSE (a school qualification) when I started drawing this piece I felt as though my drawing skills were were really good as I took my time drawing every single detail, I was just so relaxed, but from yesterday I feel as though my ability to draw has been lost, I feel as though my drawing has not been accurate at all, all the energy has just been sucked out of me due to constant drawing as I'm under pressure to getting this done quick. I just feel so down right now suicide can only be the answer to stop me feeling the way I am feeling now, I am just so confused right now even my ability to grammatically explain my situation is lost, did that even make sense? pls help me
