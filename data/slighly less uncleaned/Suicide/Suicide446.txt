What urges you to take one more breath?SarahMy name is Sarah & I’m 19 years oldAs a child, I had a pretty normal life. My parents were split, but because I was a young kid, that didn’t phase me. My dad is a struggling alcoholic, and my mom liked to pop pills. (She passed away back in December of 2014 from what I think was caused by pills) My dad just came home last summer from being incarcerated for the 3rd time as a habitual drunk driver. Since he left, I’ve been bouncing from house to house, friends to friends, family to family and job to job. I honestly don’t see happiness in anything anymore. I try to talk, but no one understands or listens, so k feel like a burden. The only option I can see is taking matters into my own hands and finally be happy. Any suggestions?
