I feel like an idiot...As title suggests, I feel like a colossal moron, idiot, whatever. I've been informed that my wife no longer loves me like a husband, that she still "cares" for me, but we "might not of been supposed to be together". And I'm basically just her roommate until Tuesday when I get paid so I can leave for NC. I don't even think I can make it that long. I have a bottle of percocet and I kinda just want to down the whole thing and see what happens. I'm just done feeling worthless, like an idiot, and placing mytrust and faith in someone/something just to be screwed over. I keep making the same mistakes and I just don't want to keep going.
