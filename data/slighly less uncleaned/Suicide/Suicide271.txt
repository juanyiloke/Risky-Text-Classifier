I can't be the only one thinking this.Hello,I guess I will simply put it in a blunt manner. There are times in which I sincerely want to experience a fatal stroke or heart attack (though I bet people who have done so would beg to differ). It doesn't matter if it's in the public or in a completely isolated environment. This will lessen the pain of having to take my own life. I can't possibly be the only one who constantly thinks about this, can I? As long as it doesn't occur around my family members. If I survive, then it would only pass by as a heart attack or some sort of other related health problem (or at least, it should); whereas attempting suicide and surviving would bring about grief and many more problems in the immediate future.
