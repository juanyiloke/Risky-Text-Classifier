Anyone need a friend? -Facebook-MarticoAre you looking for a friend? I’m not doing this out of pity i may be in need of friendship as much as you. I am empathetic person and very non-judgemental about people and situations i don’t care about age, race, religion, sexaul and if you feel differently about that, then you’re probably wasting your time reading this. What I have to offer; loyalty, trust, acceptance, support, an ear that listens, and eyes that read whatever you have to say. I may not be able to help you with all your problems but i will be there to listen and give you the best advise i can and sometimes that all we need, someone who listen and understand. So if you’re looking for a friend look me up “Amkte Eslam” or “amkteeslam@yahoo.com” I’m probably going to get few trollers too but i think it’s worth the trouble.
