I'm already dead inside, so technically I'm already dead.I’m just meI’m a 12 yr old girl and I only have three reasons to live. my few friends, my 6 yr old little cousin (only girl in my family that understands me), and my 5 yr old baby brother. b4 u say anything bout my family ‘missing’ me, only two will actually notice my absense. I know for a fact that few even genuinely care and I feel left out from the world. I was verbally and physically abused by my father when I was younger and my mother would just sit back and watch. I have a weird thing called chromesthesia, I have two voices in my head, I’m bipolar, I have anxiety so bad that I’m scared to meet anyone for fear that they’ll betray me, I have anorexia, I have depression, and I’m bisexual. yes, I’m bisexual, and I like my best friend. I came out and told my parents that I’m bisexual last week and ever since, my father has been treating me like a stranger. I lost 2 friends when I told them, and I can’t take life anymore. I’ve been thinking bout suicide for almost 7 yrs and I just can’t take it. I have severe scars on my left arm from cutting and I stopped cutting 3 weeks ago for fear of my parents finding out. I know, I’m pathetic, fat, weak, stupid, etc., and I’ve gotten to the point of punching a girl in the face yesterday. I just want it all to end, and I hide a knife under my bed so when the day comes, I’ll b ready to go. I was thinking about 7/1/15 and I was thinking about overdose on pills, drowning in the new pool that my parents got in my backyard, or hanging from my favorite tree in my backyard. the only reason I’m not dead now is bcuz I I’m scared of the pain. I want to die, but then again I don’t. I don’t really want help but I want it to end…
