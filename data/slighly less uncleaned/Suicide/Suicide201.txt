ÊThoughts about Pre-suicideSo I've kind of accepted that I am alone in the way I think and live my life. I do have family that care about me and I'd hate to hurt them but at the same time I know I am a disappointment and a failure to them and their connection to me is from genetics rather than choice.ÊI haven't really gotten to the point of attempting anything yet. I may never, except I do know once I make up my mind there is no stopping me. My life is a huge mess, I can't maintain a romantic relationship (even if my life depended on it, LOL!), and I owe a large sum of money to one of the people I care most about in this world. Honestly there are only 3 people whose continued existence anchors me here because I don't want to disappoint them (more than I already have with my life). Without them I'm pretty sure I'd slip away.Thanks for letting me get that out, I can't really tell anyone else other than the sarcastic remark when things aren't going well (and recently they haven't at all). My question to all of you is have you thought about trying to tie up your affairs, such as sell what you hold dear and perhaps live close to poverty in order to set straight financial obligations? If I'm going to leave this world (or even if not) I want to have a clean slate, not owing anyone and not leaving them harmed by my existence. Maybe I can even do some good on the way out so to speak. I don't really want to die so much as get out from under the pressing weight of life's obligations. On the one hand I really try to make people happy and many of them use me and then betray me when my usefulness ends. On the other hand I haven't been able to improve the lives of my family at all as I would like to. So maybe trying to tie things together and live more simply can change my outlook. Does anyone have experience with thinking about or doing this?
