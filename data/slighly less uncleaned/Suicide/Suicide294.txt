i dread the futurei just want to get stoned, lie in bed and have time stop. i don't want to progress, it's only ever made me feel worse.i don't want to be here next year. i don't want to move breathe or talk next year.Êall of those fucks. crying because nobody loves them. they are not people i understand. i desire no praise no love, only to wipe the utter shitstain that is me off this planet. filyhiie45awu[asfkndvnsl,/Êfilthfilth filth.scum on scum on scum onscum on scum on scum on scum,OH oh if only i was so alone i could end it without causing family complications. but i will. oh, i will have to wait till siblings grow older and events make less of an impact on them, and will distance myself from them to make it easier. ah, i know it will fuck them up. my whole family, but i will be dead- free and i wont care.why live? what for? why drag this being of utter filth, this disgusting male body onwards? hours, minutes, years spent growing the most bitter fruit- what for? to eat what makes you only throw up? why build what i only want torn down.
