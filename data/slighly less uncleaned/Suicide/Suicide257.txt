Any advice?Best friend died a month and a half ago. Feels like I haven't seen him in at least a year, time moves by so slow now. No job, no money, no motivation to get a job. Founded a startup business with a friend of mine, haven't contributed in two weeks, think I'm gonna step back. Isn't making me any money anyway. Been depressed/suicidal whole life, my friend was the only one I was able to talk to. Everything went downhill since he died. Another close friend of mine is masking all the pain in his life by doing a bunch of drugs. Think I might join him and get addicted to heroin.People say suicide isn't the answer but what's the point of living if I'm just going to be living in my parent's house with no job and being in a bad mood the whole time. Seems like I already am not living.
