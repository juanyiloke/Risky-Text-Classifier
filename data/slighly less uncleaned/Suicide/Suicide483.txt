Sick and don't knowSickI am a very accomplished person. I am 25 and have earned a bachelors degree at the top of my class. I had ambitions of being a doctor and have even been accepted to a few medical schools. Last year, I made a big move to be with my partner of 5 years which took me away from my family and friends. I was so lonely and sad. I cheated on him more than once, so he broke up with me (I don’t blame him. It’s the smart thing to do). I’m a terrible person and this is what I get for it. I found out that I was HIV+ las Thursday and just want to end it all. I just wrote a letter to my ex, apologizing for all of the pain that I have caused him and one to my mother for letting her down. I don’t want to live my life in a slow agonizing descent to death. I’d rather just do it now.The reason that I am writing this now is because of my family. My mom, grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, niece, and everyone else. There is so much love in my family, but I don’t think that I can be strong enough to work through this. I just want to end it all now, but I don’t want to cause pain in this loving family.
