What's the pointHello again,I'm simply at a loss. I thought I was going to improve at some point in time, but that was entirely false. It's only worsened. For a long time now I've considered taking my own life. I cannot go an hour without having some sort of long and drawn out thought of it occurring. It nearly sounds tempting at this point. The sole reason as to why I haven't done it yet is likely because of my little nephew (who reminds me a lot of my self when I was a child). Asides from that, I feel as if it doesn't matter if I allow everything to slip. Nobody will be deeply affected, nothing bad will happen, and life will go on for everybody else. What's the point in my existence? I'm not asking this in a "philosophical" way, but out of legitimate curiosity.As a Junior in High School, I used to be a rather scholarly person. I used to actually give a crap about my work. It's pointless now. I don't do anything except sit in front of my computer for hours on end. My grades are beginning to falter. I've lost any sort of chance of getting my Eagle rank in scouting, as I've done nothing to achieve it (despite the fact that I'm a rank away). I've become a disappointing, unreliable fool to my peers. I've become worthless. I feel like nothing but wasted matter.I hate being ostracized.I hate putting on a fake smile.I hate feigning interest in everything.I hate people in general, while also being forgiving at the same time.I hate pretending to be "fine" around my family.I hate being seen as an idiot.I hate doing anything, now.I hate using such a harsh term as "hate" to express my true feelings towards my current situation.I miss the days in which I was happy.I don't care how anybody addresses the matter, but I wish somebody could give me some advice on the situation.
