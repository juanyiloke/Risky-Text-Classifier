It's going to be alright - ?Really? At what point are things going to be alright? How do you know? How could you know?ÊYes, you can see my strength. That's great, but why don't I feel strong then? Even if it was just a little bit?You have no idea, simply no clue how I am feeling, living or perhaps existing.But yes, I have it all together, and it's going to be alright?At what point does me telling someone "I don't want to be here" turn into or become an indication I may need some help?But nope, just stay quiet, disappear. Believe me when I say I'm fine. But don't believe me when I say these other things.Really - Alright, everything will be just fine. For fucks sake.Open up - why? So those extremely secret of secrets are out there and not acknowledged? Do people even realize how much it takes to say some things in the open? And nothing, just silence. Okay, so I should have kept these things to myself then. Stupid bloody me, yet again.What does it take to be alright? And when will this happen, o wise people?ÊI'm so fucking wound up tonight my body is shaking. Anxiety is really, really high. But, I have to "trust" that it's going to be alright? In this state I'm in, really? You think so?
