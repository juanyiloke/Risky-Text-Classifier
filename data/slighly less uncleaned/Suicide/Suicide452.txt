Broken beyond repairStaceyI’ve been thinking about killing myself. I’m a cancer. I don’t offer anything useful to this world. My husband would be way better off without me, as well as my family. I’ve always been a cancer. I should have never been born. I’m stupid and useless. I use to be so positive. I wish I could be that way again, but life won’t allow it. I want to end it, but I’m scared. I’m scared to hurt my family. I’m scared of the unknown. But I’m over feeling this way. I’m a loser and I will always be a loser.
