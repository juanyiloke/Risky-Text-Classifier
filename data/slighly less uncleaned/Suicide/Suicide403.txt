What's Left?brokennangelWhat’s left? When I was younger, I was raped and sexually abused yet got ;justice’ for neither. I had friends, they committed suicide. The ones that are left call me a freak, avoiding me making my life a living hell. My parents don’t give a shit about me. There’s really nothing to live for anymore. Everything has it’s mistakes. Even the world, nothing can be completely perfect. I’m one of the world’s mistakes, and all my luck for life has run out. June 12 will finally be the day.~Angel~
