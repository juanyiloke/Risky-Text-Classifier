Can't Take it AnymoreWhy is it okay that I continue to lead a miserable life with this disorder? Why must I appease people and continue to live for them? What about my mental health? All my dreams and goals are gone. I have no sense of normalcy. Why can it not be acceptable to end it? Why must I continue on and live this way just so others can have peace of mind that I am still breathing? I think that is pretty selfish. I am so very miserable and cannot cope with this disorder and I have tried for over a decade to get help with no success. Everything I have ever wanted is gone. I will eventually do it...it is just a matter of when and when my misery outweighs the misery my mother would feel from my demise. To be honest the scale is tipping....I know I keep talking about this but I can so feel it is near because I am so finished with this life.
