Tired of fucking up
I am just tired of fucking up. Simple as that.

I have problems reacting to things. I see something on Facebook, and it sets me off.

It happened again today. I don't even do something that loud - I have a habit of rubbing my hands together when I'm upset. I don't yell, I don't scream, I just do that.

But my wife hears me, and that's enough. It gets her upset. At me.

She made me delete my Facebook account. I know I need to not get upset at things I read, but at the same time, I don't even know how to deal with things that other people say without getting upset. And clearly, I don't know how to manage my upset without other people getting upset at me.

I feel like I can't make anyone happy. No matter what I do, people will just tolerate me until they find something wrong, then they'll shout the riot act at me. I'm tired of dealing with it.

Don't tell me to go to counseling. I'm already in counseling. Whole lot of good that's doing me. :-(

I'm tired of getting hurt. I'm tired of people expecting me to be okay with getting hurt. :-(

I know I'll be abandoning my family, but on the other hand, I'm tired of having that hanging over my head as something to get me to expect to be okay with how things are.

And I'm tired of fucking up and people getting upset with me. :-(
