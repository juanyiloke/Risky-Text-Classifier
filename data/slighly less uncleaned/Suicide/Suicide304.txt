HopelessnessI was just watching an episode of a popular sitcom where a baby was born. The mother burst into overjoyed tears and the child entered the world as innocent and unblemished as ever. And I thought that that is how so many of us enter this world: innocent, pure, hopeful. It amazes me that such innocence can transform into such sorrow and misery. My parents were overjoyed when I was born as well but I have experienced such incredible sadness, trauma, anxiety, and pain these past few years that I wish I was not even brought into this world in the first place. My dreams are shattered, my future is ruined, and perhaps the worst thing is that there is no hope that my life will get any better. There is certainly no light at the end of the tunnel. I sat in my darkened room all day today with their air conditioner turned up so that I would not hear the sounds of life outside. I will never be happy in life because there is no remedy that will cure the source of my sorrow and pain. I pray for death all the time.
