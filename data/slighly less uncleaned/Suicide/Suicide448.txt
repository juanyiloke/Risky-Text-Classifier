manikin in the windowbecky sueI don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live. I stay inside all day even though I have two legs that walk. I’m not depressed, and I have friends, but I don’t have motivation to do anything. I’m 5’4? 115 lbs. blond hair and green eyes, I’m educated and have skills to do many things, but I don’t do anything. I’m always afraid to leave the house, but once I’m out, I’m fine. It’s just the leaving part that I can’t do. I will get up in the morning, take a shower, get dressed, put on my makeup, curl my hair and stand at the front door frozen in place. I want to go, I’m ready to go, but I don’t go. There’s always an excuse like today my bike tires were flat, even though I have access to a tire pump in the garage. I think about everything I need to do, I see myself walking to the garage and filling the tires. I even see myself riding to the river, or to my daughters house, but I don’t. I’m so sick of wasting my life away, because I can’t just go. I want to, why don’t I?
