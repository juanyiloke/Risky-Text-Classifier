I need helptoo scared of judgement from family to go to the doctorsmy friends are fine but my family are not the samemy dad will make cruel jokes, or at least un-funny jokes like when I came outmy mum might ignore it or might just not accept itwhen I was 13 I wrote a note to my mum saying that I felt so bad I wanted to "end it all" and she sat there and cried over it, took me to the doctors and when the doctor brushed me off as anxious since she didn't bother mentioning anything other than physical symptoms and she was there and I was scared - she dropped itI've self harmed by cutting for years, only stopped last summer, and sometimes they saw the cuts or scars and my dad would ignore it and my mum would fucking tell me off "this is bad"I LIVE with these people and if I go to the doctors they will know I'm going out and I'll have to lie and I'll have to phone up the doctors' to make an appointment and I'd rather die than deal with any of ita chance arises in the form of a friend who has gotten help themselves, so maybe they will come to the doctors' with me but it's still so much stress on me that I can't take iteverything makes me want to curl up and disappear because it's too much to handle going to spank the monkey then hit the hay - I might ask them about it tomorrow and I dont' want to be mid-wallow
