I am very sick, perfectionism made be helpless and very twistedI may be the strangest human alive. I obsess over little things like a misspelled word in a letter to a love interest in 1989. People usually feel better about themselves with others imperfections, so why can't I be happy with other people respecting you more when you are vulnerable and human, a very good thing? I am such a poor loser. How do I humble myself, fixations are tearing me apart. I am very suicidal and need all the love and support I can get. Sometimes these things don't bother me at first then I feel inferior in the long run. One man said time heals all wounds, but I am getting worse? Please help, I need a life but don't have one.Jim
