ÊMY lowest pointHi AllIts not very often that i feel this low.It takes a lot. Something really petty has triggered it all.So last night i wasn't feeling in the best of moods and i had originally said id go out to see a band play. I decided to chill out at home... at first. So as always it involved a girl... my sister in law texted me and said oh are you coming out then? i was like no, she was oh but sadie (the girl i like) was really hoping you'd be here. I was like ohhhhhhhh ok give me a while and ill be there. Do anyway, i went there and she had gone. I was just like i really can't be arsed and long story short we all ended up back at my sister in laws place. I got talking with her and she had already turned round and said no its okay. Im not looking for anything serious. I was just like i feel like I've been taken the piss out of. I didn't want to go out. I wasn't expecting anything from this girl. She told people she liked me and it wasn't the case. That mixed with a really shitty couple of weeks. Being told I'm not good enough, Realising people were right about me all along. Remember things that happened when i was younger. I just hit rock bottom last night. I phoned my friend and this looked up and a very long tearful conversation on the phone and i felt worse. I done something on impulse which i shouldn't have done. But, i did anyway. It was self harming but in a completely unorthodox way. I just fail to see anyway up these days... its getting harder and harder in a cruel world that doesn't understand me. I want people to understand but I fear that they won't or can't!
