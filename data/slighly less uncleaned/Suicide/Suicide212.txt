Hard NightHello~ I am having a hard night. I drink too much and the nights can be very difficult. Sometimes I just feel like there is no hope for me. I am sad & scared and don't know what to do. I am trying to get help for my alcohol addiction but I am still in the early stages of treatment and it is difficult to see a way out. I have a plan for suicide but have don't really have a date, however I have tied up all loose ends so I am ready to do. The only thing holding me back is my family and God. I really don't know how much more I can take. As embarrassing and shameful as it is to admit, I am on my 3rd bottle of wine tonight. I don't deserve to live. I don't deserve life. I am so stupid for letting this get out of control. I can't even stand myself. Please, I am asking for you to please pray or hope that I have the strength to end it. I can't take anymore. Thank You.
