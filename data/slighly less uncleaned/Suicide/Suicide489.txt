ForneverhereTheo gonzalesI live in Colorado Springs, I’m 19 and have had suicidal ideation for at least four years now. It wasn’t until I realized that I would never be able to off myself until I cut all strings with society, that I started that process. Now here I am. 9:25 in the morning. Birds chirping. Kids playing. Me crying like a little bitch. I don’t even know why I’m on this site. Or why my fingers keep moving to make words for this post. Or why I known in going to submit this and hope someone responds with anything. Telling me to stop. Telling me how I should go out. My bucket list is for the next twenty four hours and then I’m gone.
