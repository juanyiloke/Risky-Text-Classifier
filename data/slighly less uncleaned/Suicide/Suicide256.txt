made to sufferI just don't know what to do anymore. Death is the only solution. I don't know what to do about anything. I don't have the will to continue. There is no point. There never was. My mind is suffocating me to death on a daily basis. It won't allow me to do anything. I am killing myself from the inside and nobody on the outside knows just how severe it is. It's not their fault. It's not my fault. It's just that I was made to suffer. I'm powerless.ÊI just want to get away from my existence. But then it'll be the same shit. I deathly need to get mental help and get help for my unbearable physical pain. My mind won't let me. It refuses. It's like a parasite... my logic has concluded that death is the only option and I just can't argue about it with myself anymore. Nobody can take the steps for me to fight for my life. I need to have the will and motivation to continue and I just don't have it. I don't. I'm defeated. I know in my heart that the end is coming for me soon. It's gonna be painful. I fear everything... I'm helpless. Weak. Useless. Just a leech at this point. I can't wait for all the fear to go away.It's all gonna come crashing down. I hate myself and I hate existence. What a cruel joke. I don't know why I'm even reaching out anymore.ÊThis is not goodbye. That's all I got right now. All I got left.
