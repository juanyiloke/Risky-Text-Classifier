My Story: When your kids mean the worldGregoryI am / was a proud father of my two children. I had a good job, a nice house. Things were going well.Seven and a half months later and I haven’t seen my kids since my wife left. I’ve take four overdoses which didn’t work – tried to jump off a ferry – suicidal thoughts are a constant companion. I’ve lost my career. I’m living in a homeless hostel in a country I don’t know, have been in jail, psychiatric hospital all because I slapped my wife after years of being in a co-abusive relationship. Since I’ve been diagnosed with an undisclosed personality disorder (possibly BPD or NPD) coupled with some PTSD, I have been keeping a blog. I hate feeling like this, having the constant thoughts of running away, abandoning my kids, killing myself – it is a real struggle not to act on them. I’ve worked so hard to try and get well – but I realised if I feel like this, then others do too. So I published my journals online (anonymously obviously), in the vain hope that someone may learn something from the shit I’ve been through – or it might help them explain how they are feeling to someone else.http://www.theabusiveman.co.ukI’m not going to tell you that things get better; I’m sick of people telling me how I should be thinking or feeling. Hopefully the blog can bring you some comfort in knowing that you are not weird for having the feelings you are experiencing.Anyway, check it out
