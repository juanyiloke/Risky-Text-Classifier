No Good...Hey there. I'm feeling really upset about my life. What triggered it is the same thing as always... you see... I'm a very dependent person and none of my friends want to see me today. I'm 23 years old and I still feel like a child.Here's a list of why I hate my life and want to die most of the time:- My parents divorced when I was 2 years old.- I have been seeing a counselor since I was 8.- My father was my hero, until he committed suicide when I was 11.- I have been medicated/seeing a psychiatrist since age 12.- I stopped caring about school as a child and never recovered.- I barely graduated highschool. I still don't know how the staff managed to pass me. They most likely felt sorry for me.- I have attempted suicide about 6 times, but the only two times I came close were in the past 6 years. I mainly tried overdosing on my own meds. So now my mother keeps a lock box with a key near her.- I have never had a real job.- I still live with my parents.- I have no desire to do anything with my life.- I don't know how to drive a car, and I have an irrational fear of doing so.- I have never even thought about college.- I only have a few true friends.- I rely on marijuana to keep me happy. I don't ever buy it myself, but I use/manipulate people into smoking me up most of the time.- I have a boyfriend that I have been seeing for a few years, but I know he's going to get tired of me.- I have a knack for driving people away.
