(mod, when you approve the post, if is indecent or such go ahead and delete it like everything else I do)I fail at life. I fucking fail.Ê30 year old virgin, never been kissed, never get more than two dates or a friendship.ÊI've been fired from the last 4 places I've worked for, just got canned this past week. Got rejected 4 times to date. Have had 3 vehicles break down/totaled in the last 12 months.ÊI've no job now, no more income (i'll probably be late on my bill this month for internet),. I'm fat, ugly, horrible teeth like really rotting badly and some are missing,ÊI just don't know what to do...I've no real life skills. I can't fix my own vehicles, most shit that I come across I have no clue on what to do. Its hopeless. I just don't know. I keep thinking that if I was gone at least half or more of the crap I fuck up on wouldn't happen.Ê<mod edit - methods>What do I do?
