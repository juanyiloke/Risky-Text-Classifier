Just existing.I don't really know what I'm expecting to gain from this but I looked at some other threads and was inspired to talk about my own suicide/depression issues. My major problems, I'm the baby of the family so my parents never made me do anything, I lashed out at them spent time in treatment and I realized how much life sucked being away from home. So I've been good to them ever since, but the enabling never stopped. So after I quit school and sat on my butt for almost 5 years. (somehow got my GED) and my parents finally realized that I was wasting away in my own depression, lack of ambition, friends and motivation. So they gave me the necessary swift kick in the rear end I always needed, they kicked me out. I've been at my sister's for about 3 months, I have a job, had a girlfriend(who I broke up with because I'm stupid.) and I've realized that none of this makes me happy. I don't feel particularly better and I think about suicide everyday. I feel like life is a facade of exchanging stupid pleasantries and just getting through the day. What's the point? Not to mention the way the world is and how people are changing into something disgusting. I don't want to be apart of this game anymore, but I still persevere. I'm on the edge and I'm always waiting for something to either push me over or pull me back from it. I don't know what I want from life and I find some comfort in thinking about what waits for me after it. Be it hell, heaven or whatever unknown afterlife, I don't really care anymore. I'm not going to kill myself, just expressing my feelings. I can't confide in anyone in my life because it would turn into a huge fiasco so I just lie and say I'm great. Thanks for reading.
