Am I alone?Suicide has been a constant in my mind for 12 years. Can't say for certain what triggered my depression but I feel like I'm finally at my wits end. I recently stopped taking the Zoloft that just made me numb to the b.s. Effexor, Prozac, Cymbalta I've taken em all. They DO NOT make me all happy go lucky they just dull the pain. No one except my mom even knows I battle depression. If I talk to her about it she just counters it with how depressed SHE is!. I watch the news and hear of all the lives lost. People battling cancer, car accidents, murder, all innocent. yet there are so many people on here that would take their own lives if brave enough. It just makes no sense.
