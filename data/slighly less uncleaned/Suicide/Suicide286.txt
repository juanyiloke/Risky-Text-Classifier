Plan...I have lots of days when i think about dying. How it would be to just disappear from here.Its hard to say to be honest... but i cant live here anymore. Its impossible.I have that opportunity at 2 unis this year, in roughly 5 months.I so far realized that 2 of my goals most likely wont happen. So i am left with one goal, to become a doctor. But even that goal wont push me hard enough to survive. I need to move out and those 2 unis are my only chance to do that.I decided that i will cope with my bad feeling and all by then. If i dont manage to enter either of those 2 unis, i plan on taking my life. Its hard to think about it and it hurts me deeply, but idk.. it seems right. I suffer a lot. I know that there is people who get it much worse then me, but i am weak. I always have been weak. I am running out of strength and if i dont manage to get to those 2 unis it will be end of me.Knowing me, i will most likely give up on this plan, since i have always been a quitter, but idk really... I feel like i am slowly getting ready to give up...
