Why are we still alive?I've been thinking recently.ÊThere's been so much death in the world. Like, these days, plane crashes, shootings and freak accidents. My phone has this option where news from all over the world pops up on my home screen and everyday, a few times a day, there's a report about someone or some people dying. Buzzfeed, too.ÊSo, why then, am I still alive is what I've been wondering. If i ask anyone I know this question, they're going to say, 'because you're still meant to do something here' or some variation of that but that feels like a load of crap.I've actually been praying I don't wake up in the morning - every night, I pray for that, and I'm still here. A few of us here have actually attempted, myself included, yet we are still here.So many out there are dying but we're not. I just really wonder why.
