Life without love22 yo college student.Title pretty much describes it in a nutshell. There is no love in my family, and I don't even want it anymore since they completely messed me up growing up---just want to get away. As an introvert I don't make close friends easily, and I don't get satisfaction from casual friends. My main focus has been on getting a romantic relationship, but the half dozen girls I have briefly dated in my four years of college all ended up dumping me. I was ready to give everything to them, and was so devoted. I would bike from my off-campus apartment at midnight just to go watch netflix with them, and would listen and console them when they were sad, and I would tell them how much I loved them regularly. But at the end of the day it doesn't matter how you feel about someone or what you are willing to do for them. What matters is who you are, and how they feel about you. And from experience, I have learned that I am not a person who can inspire love. I am not exciting enough, not funny enough, not outgoing enough. Being just emotional turns them off pretty fast, but I can't help it if that is how I feel. Right now I am having a bit of an episode, I guess, thinking about how I have failed to find love at college (the place where it should have been easiest), and how now I am going into the real world, alone, where it will be infinitely more difficult. I don't think there is any hope for me. My one dream my entire life has been to experience love, and now I don't believe it will ever happen to me.
