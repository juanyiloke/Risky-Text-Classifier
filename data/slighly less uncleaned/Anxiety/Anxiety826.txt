finding things hardSorry I haven't been on here awhile I have been dealing with a lot of things, my counselling is going well, my meds seem to be helping. The memories of the abuse I suffered when I was a child is killing me at the moment. I am finding it hard to keep it together for my family. The anxiety is calming but the depression, the horrible thoughts are getting worst. I don't want it to the stage that is was before as I tried to take my own life. I really trying hard here. Sorry you got my rant, when I haven't been on here for awhile but I have no on else to let it out to.
