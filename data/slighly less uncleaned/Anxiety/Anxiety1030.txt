GAD & Physical SymptomsHi EveryoneI am new here and looking for help advice etc as everyone is I had my worst panic attack by far yesterday, the symptoms hit me full force and it took me a good 20 mins to recover to a point I felt I had some control again. I had someone with me who has a daughter who suffers and knows what to do and he was a huge help and helped me not to lose total controlI don't know if it's just in my mind but it has happened twice in this new job and both times after I have eaten, after food my throat feels like it's tightening and I struggle esp as these are real physical symptoms to the point yest and today I have barley eaten at work for fear it could set off another attackDoes anyone else suffer with the physical symptoms or am I alone? All this is new to me so trying to cope with it all is a bit hardThanks xx
