Help? Anyone.. At a breaking point with Cobstant Anxiety and PanicOkay, so I'm at a completely breaking point right now.. I don't even know what is wrong with me anymore! Everything seems so complex and complicated anymore. I waking up in panic attacks again that I haven't done since I first started getting my panic attacks/hypochondria/and constant anxiety. I just feel off. No motivation. I don't work because of it. The longest job I ever held was part-time and for a few months. I don't know how else to help myself anymore. I have NO money. My mom supports me and she is barely making ends meat. I'm so anxious ALL the time. Every day, all day. Nights are the worse. I constantly feel like I'm on the verge of breaking out into a seizure or completely losing all my sanity because I feel SO tense and just not real at all times (Depersonalization/Derealization). It's been 7 years almost now and I'm worse than ever. I wa going to do meditation but then read that meditation can cause negative effects like the not feeling real or feeling detached. I am swamped with doctor bills because I've seen so many doctors and I feel NO better they can only say that anxiety disorder is my problem. I guess I can't fully accept that is all that's wrong with me so I flip flop all day between I'm dying and illnesses or I'm going schizophrenic and losing my reality. I'm really lost. Really hopeless. Suicidal at times. Excersise isn't working at all. My Klonopin doesn't even feel like it works sometimes (.5 milligrams). I got prescribed clomiprimine I think it's called but EVERY time I take any meds I freak out. Someone please help.. My brother and everybody just tells me to just say **** it because my brother has anxiety issues and has had panic attacks but he has his own life going on and I can't handle my own life at all which is so depressing.
