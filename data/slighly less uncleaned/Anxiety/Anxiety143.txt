help Ê12    Hi i am 24 years old i suffer from anxiety and depression i was really bad on online bingo and think this is what triggered the anxiety off i ended up getting to point i couldn't eat sleep think straight constantly crying feeling crap over other peoples problems i ended up feeling like i didn't love my lil boy n his dad anymore and ended up in a mental health hospital over it i finely got my feelings back and started being me again but these last few weeks it's all come back but different stuff but I've also started back on the bingo not going anywhere but to drop and pick my boy up from school am just wondering if it's maybe the bingo that's fetched it back my partner seems to think it is x
