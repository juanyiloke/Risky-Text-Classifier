Overthink and stress about everything. My latest problem (2/5/15) Ê10    First thanks for looking.I'm a 21 year old male.I got into an accident on Tuesday and then to calm myself down I went driving on the dual carriageway to calm myself down. Speed calms me down I guess.Anyway, the person I had an accident with said it wasn't anything big and we can settle without going through insurance. It was a little bump in the car park when her car wasn't moving nor when she was in the car. I hit her "fender" so the car door was a little hard to open. I've been stressing about this since Tuesday and its driving absolutely insane. Its my first accident as well which doesn't help.Update: Also, that same day I know I wasn't speeding, well there was one point for about 10-15 seconds I was speeding but as soon as i saw the camera I slammed on the breaks and slowed down so I feel 100% sure I wont be prosecuted. Besides I was only doing 10 mph than the limit which according to car manufacturers the speedometer over reads and you don't get flashed until you do 10%+2 over the limit.Update 2: But because of that i feel as though id lose my license. In my heart I know i wont lose it but the thought keeps running through my mind and I've made myself so scared!What I'm getting to is, I always overthink and stress myself out. Help me please, how do i stop?
