It is so debillitating Ê16    I was ok for weeks and then there were changes at work. My mananger who was fantastic left. The new one is ok but not the same.My friend died last year but I accepted it cos we had 2 happy years together.But for the last two weeks I feel I am losing my grip. I got offered another job but I had to turn it down because nerves make me feel so weak.I try not to give in and go out. But I go round the supermarket shaking and sighing when there is a queue.Hate feeling like this Ê7    I'm on sertraline have been for couple weeks and also I'm on propranolol 40mg been on them for couple months ..I was just sitting there when I was thinking n thought I heard that propranolol can stop the heart now I'm so scared, I duno weather the sertraline is working or not. I hate anxiety so so much. My hearts racing feel like I got something in my throat so I keep swallowing it's horrible ? my anxiety is much worse at night. I hope everyone is ok xFeeling off and spaced outDoes anyone feel spaced out and just numb from Anxiety. It's a weird feeling to try and describe but just don't feel right. It's like the mind has shut off. I find myself trying to remember what I did yesterday to snap myself out of it but it's tough so it's like I am getting dementia. It seems to go away when I don't think about it but as we all know that's very hard to do. It scares me so much because I think it has to be something else then anxiety and depression. It's like I have lived the past two weeks in a dream like state. I have been on Cit for 3 weeks now so hopefully this will go away sometime. I am worried it never will.Ê
