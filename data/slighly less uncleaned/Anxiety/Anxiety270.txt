When Right Feels WrongI don’t think I get severe panic attacks like most of you, my friends, struggle with. But when I am experiencing anxiety, the right hemisphere of my brain feels like exploding. Sometimes I even imagine it stuck with some big stone or something and that it is swelling. Half migraine, I suppose. At times my migraine would even be accompanied by vision problems like when it is so hard to look straight at something or someone when I am talking to them because my eyes feel like gouging out. But it is possible that the reason for that might be only due to lack of sleep. I have insomnia. Moreover, my right ear usually feels dysfunctional when it is really not. And sometimes when my anxiety is really bad, my right jaw tightens that I feel like I would be getting a half stroke. It is different from most cases, though wherein the sufferer would get even more anxious and panic after experiencing those similar situations because in my case, I just submit to the possible negative outcomes of it. Partly because I assume it would lead to death which is more appealing to me and I guess mostly because I believe I am miserable enough no matter what happens to me. So, I am just wondering... do I really have an anxiety disorder? PS. The first time I posted here, no one replied and I've gotten a little anxious about it especially when I see the number of views. Maybe no one here likes lengthy stories eh?
