crazy or not crazy29 - stuffered from anxiety all of my life, but never phsycial symptoms, until a month ago.Ê I injured my side awhile back by falling, freaked myself out by googling symptoms ( kidney area ) started googling stuff, lead to parkinsons disease, went numb all over in bed one night, downhill from there, started feeling weak in legs / arms / fingers / hands. googled again, brought up MS. now i get constant fatigue, wake up feeling like i haven't slept, internal shaking and external shaking, if i use any muscle on my body, it shakes, random twitches in calves, sometimes other places, hot feeling in legs / feet. teeth chattering that nobody can see, but i feel it. Freaked out over it for weeks, was at the point of ***** and breakdowns every hour. My heart isn't racing, i don't feel panicky, maybe i do but just can't really tell, but i still have all of these phsycial symptoms, i try and try to tell myself it's just anxiety but something keeps telling me it's not. I have been in a very emotional depression state for at least a week now. I've been to my doctor multiple times, and the hospital. I have had blood test done, i feel like everyone think's i am insane.Ê I've given my doctor a long list of my symptoms and he basically told me that i have GAD and it is past the point of normal anxiety now, he told me i am basically so far gone that i need to see a Psychiatrist and get onto medicine, i don't like medicine, that is one of my biggest fears, taking medicine and getting side effects. Is this possible to feel all of these symptoms and it just be stress/anxiety that's causing it? I don't even feel like i have been panicking the last few days, i kind of feel like me but not as happy but yet i still have these symptoms when not in panic mode. I don't understand any of this.
