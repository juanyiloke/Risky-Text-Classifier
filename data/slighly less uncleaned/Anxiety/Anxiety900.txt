Mindfulness- has anyone had any success?Hi, I have been going to a therapist for my depression and anxiety for the past 8 months and he has suggested to me that I need to start reconnecting with present. I basically live in my head thinking about the past and the things that have hurt me or caused me anxiety, or in the future worrying about things that may or may not happen. I have made progress with this during my sessions but my main thing is I can't let go. He has said that mindfulness will really help me and I have read lots about it, and have starting doing some of the meditation, but I'm feeling a little sceptical. Anyone actually had success with mindfulness?
