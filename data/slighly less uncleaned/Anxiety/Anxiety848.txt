New to GAD- longtime sufferer, cipralex side effectsHi AllI have been on cipralex for just about 16 days now for my GAD.I have to say the break from worrying and making myself sick from over obsessing is nice, but the side effects are really strange.To date I suffer from- sweaty soles of feet, sweaty hands, weird dreams, dry mouth, jaw clenching and low sex drive.... Hoping this will pass in the next few weeks, but not to worry is worth some of these effects?How did everyone else do in the their first month?
