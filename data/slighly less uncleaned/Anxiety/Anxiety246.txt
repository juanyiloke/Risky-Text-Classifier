Anxiety and AvoidanceHello, I'm new here and looking for an honest place to vent. I'm not a stranger to anxiety, when I was about 10 I developed an intense fear/phobia that one of my family members was going to die.. I snapped out of it after a few months and haven't had another full blown "episode" until now...ÊI'm in my 20s and can't believe this is happening again at this age, but things have gotten bad. I've been dealing with agoraphobia, I've stopped going to my classes and can barely leave my room some days lately. I have to email my professors and see if there's any way they'll still allow me to turn things in late, but I have no valid excuse for missing class and getting this behind so I fear the worst. I have an issue with avoidance in general but the endless vicious cycle is becoming unbearable-the more overwhelmed I feel the more I avoid things, and the more I avoid the worse things get. The main issue is school right now but it could be anything really.ÊFrom my understanding avoidance can become a compulsion? I now understand my first phobia was probably a form of OCD, the fear became an obsession and I had certain rituals or compulsions to help "manage" the anxiety. As irrational as that seemed at least there was a specific fear to address, with agoraphobia and avoidance I'm lost on where to start..ÊJust wondering if anyone can relate or has any thoughts.
