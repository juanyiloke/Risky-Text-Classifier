So much has happened over the last few months, I feel so anxious and nervous all the time.Hi, I am completely new to this and hope that I can at least get some reassurance that I am not going bonkers! To cut a very long story short. Up until last November I could cope with what was happening in my life. I downsized from my family home of 29yrs a year and half   into a bungalow with my husband. We have been married for 16yrs. My son (not my husbands) had a drug problem which caused a lot of animosity in the family, but being my son, I have always stuck by him. I had a row with my elderly mother over him and have not seen here since Xmas. She has always been very demanding and I did a lot for her (apparently not enough though). My younger sister has had a rough time with cancer (two operations since January) but I have not seen her either. This all stems from last November when my husband just upped and left. I was ok for a couple of weeks and then everything just seemed to close round me. I have been so depressed as I have no-one to turn to. I have never been one to make friends (my life revolved around family) and not one of them gave me any support when my husband left. I think that is why I have cut myself off from them because I was always there for them. I have even stopped going out because I have panic attacks. I go to bed depressed and wake up depressed as I can see no way forward. I have not heard a word from my husband since he walked out 6 months   so it's as though he's died. To top all this, I will be 60 in a couple of months. Please, can someone help me out of this dark hole?Ê
