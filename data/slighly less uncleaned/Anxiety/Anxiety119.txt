Health anxiety... HELP  10    If anyone reading this can relate please write to me. Okay so I've recently been diagnosed as having health anxiety. It all started with horrendous palpitations. Which led me to A&E convinced I was having a heart attack. I was reassured I was not And was fine for a few  . Then I was sure I had a blood clot, reassured, fine for a few  ,,, then I found a lump, then I had a numb patch if skin, all been reassured all okay. Then they discovered my health anxiety! I'm now getting on my left tingly fingers, heavy arm and today I couldn't grasp my fork. I'm now having the worst panic attack of my life (heart palpitations, petrified, crying, feel sick) is what I experienced prior to me having this panic attack a lead up to this attack and just another symptom of anxiety or would you say to see my GP? Thanks
