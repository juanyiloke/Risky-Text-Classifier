Health anxiety taking over my life....please help!! Ê7    I have been suffering from health anxiety now since having my first daughter 6 years  . It got so bad I become  raphobic and suffered terrible panic attacks. I really thought after having CBT therapy and years of feeling better I had finally over come this. I had my second daughter a year   and 4 months   it's suddenly come back out of the blue. I feel the worst I have ever felt.It started with a pain in my right breast. I was and still am convinced something is wrong. My GP reassured me on two occasions that all was ok but I was not convinced. She referred me to the breast clinic where I saw a consultant and had a breast ultrasound. All came back fine but here I am still convinced they have missed something and constantly googling every slight twinge that I have.What is wrong with me? Some  I just sit and cry and just long to be a normal person. I watch people walking down the street and just wished I could be normal like them. I would love to just wake up without having the black cloud above my head or just somebody to say it's going to be ok?!I was just wondering really if anybody else out there has ever constantly worried even though being told they are ok? I'm thinking about paying for a second ultrasound but would that really help? My husband doesn't understand. He tries to comfort my crying but how can he when he doesn't know what's really wrong.Really appreciate any advice!!
