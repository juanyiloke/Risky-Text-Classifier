blipHaving a rough time the past week or so. My husband and I finally closed on our house and moved in over the past three weeks. We were moving non-stop after work during that time and on the weekends. Finally in with all our stuff and taking care of day to day around the house, getting used to being homeowners. Then we had a wedding to travel to this weekend so didn't have any down time then either to relax.ÊWhat makes it worse is last week I had to meet with a client who was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer (ding ding ding goes my health anxiety bells). I did my best to be present with him, let him feel what he needed to, and not let it get to me, but it did of course. I went home on Friday and was an anxious mess. This is going to sound terrible and selfish, but I am afraid of when this client comes back this week because of how it affects me. But I can't transfer him to somebody else during this crisis for him.Well this has me thinking about my job and am I really cut out for this? I had no time to really think about it over the weekend because of traveling. So cue Monday morning and I am freaking out before work, panicking, upset. I ended up calling out and taking a mental health day because I wouldn't have been any good there anyway. But now I am anxious and depressed, also my time of the month so trying to remind myself that my blips usually hit this time and to wait it out.ÊI just don't know if I am cut out to do this work. Sometimes I think I am and other times I don't think I can handle it. But I paid for a master's degree and bought a house, so no looking back now.
