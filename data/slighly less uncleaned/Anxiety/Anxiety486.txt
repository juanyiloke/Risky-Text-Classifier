Freaked out about blood testI went to the doctors office on monday for just a regular checkup and she asked to do a cholesterol and CBC panel. I agreed to do it as I have never had it done before.Ê I got my results back today and (it's the weekend I can't exactly call the office) I'm a little concerned. My cholesterol is high which is no surprise to me because for the last several years I have routinely eaten fast food regularly. During that time I can only imagine the hit my heart and arteries have taken. Luckily I'm only 25 years old, so I'm hoping that over time I can turn things around and eat the way I should.ÊSo to what really scares me. On a seperate test, the CBC, my hemoglobin levels were elevated by 2%. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it's not within normal range. Like an idiot I googled that and saw that it could mean bone marrow problems or other pretty severe disorders. I also had high albumin, which I have no idea what it is, but apparently that can be a precursor to renal failure. So now I'm freaked out thinking I have something really serious going on here and nobody to discuss it with for at least another 24 hours.
