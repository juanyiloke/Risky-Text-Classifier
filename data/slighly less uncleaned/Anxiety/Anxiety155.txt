Help! Want opinions! Ê13    Hi guys! So, a little over two weeks  , I got online and freaked out at what I saw after I had been feeling some slight tingling in my feet. I have gotten a lot better in the last   with my anxiety... My symptoms of "ailments" have seemed to have diminished quite significantly, and I am now able to eat more normally. However, I still get super worried because I now have more recently started receiving headaches, normally at the top of my head, the side, or right between my eyes. Sometimes it feels like it comes from my ears as well. Every single time I get one, I start freaking out!!! I will be living my day pretty well (much better than the past couple weeks), I will think more rationally, but then one hits and I will automatically assume I have c****r or MS or something like that! It makes me really worried! Also, I have started waking up every single night after about one hour of sleep, I wake up normally around 11:30 pm, and it scares me! I started taking Tylenol PM a couple of nights   as a gentle sleep aid, and I still wake up at 11:30, and I want to freak out, but I find myself not really able to, because I think the medicine is making me drowsy? Then it doesn't not help when my dad just goes "are you losing weight?" Rationally, it can be attributed to the fact that for two weeks I did not eat very well, but then I start getting those "what if" questions in my mind. Do you guys think this is just all worry and anxiety related? How do y'all deal with this?
