VentCan I vent here? I'm normally active on the Paraphilias section, but I used to have very bad anxiety and depression and in recent years everything has been low-level. Over the past couple of months, however, my anxiety and panic attacks have been getting worse, more frequent, almost disabling (certainly today). I feel sick, shaky, desperate. I had a lot of work before Christmas, I then spent the Christmas holiday travelling and in an unfamiliar environment, the short days have been getting to me, I have a perpetual crush I can't act on and wouldn't act on, and then a relative died. On top of that I've got two kids who are lovely but have been providing me with interrupted nights over the past week or so and my sleep has been terrible as a result. And once the anxiety kicks in properly I become a lot more sensitive. I feel lonely, misunderstood (because of my sexuality), worried about my symptoms (anxiety about anxiety; I'm sure that will sound familiar to a few people here), and generally ill with it all.Fortunately I picked up a big back of beta blockers from the pharmacy today. I may have one for breakfast tomorrow morning.Ê
