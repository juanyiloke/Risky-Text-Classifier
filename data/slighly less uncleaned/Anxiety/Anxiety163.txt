My Doctor hasn't diognosed me with anxiety,but im constantly worried and fearful?  14    I've been to see my GP quite a few times, and when i tell them i'm having panic attacks, they tell me it's down to stress at school, but deep down i know its not, my grades aren't too bad. I'm constanly worried about what awaits me and just dont know where to turn because i dont know what it is. I dread having to go to out and when i am im constanly edgy? i feel like i worry more than i should but i cant control it? am i experiencing some form of anxiety or is this normal?3 weeks on citalopram , losing hope !well it was three weeks yesterday on citalopram 20mg at night , still waking up with blind panic and a kind of depersonalisation situation , feeling panicked when alone and mind wandering , constantly thinking about impending doom , mind is definitely not as sharp as it was , really foggy like my eyesight , I suffer so much cognitively , really bizarre , surely this cannot be just anxiety/depression ? Mind is always confused and hazy , t.v is on but doesn't mean a great deal and I really don't want to venture out , Any ideas ? pregnancy and medicationI'm 24 and my partner is 31 and we really want to try for a baby. I'm on pregabalin and I really don't think I'm ready to come off or at least have nothing and be alone but I don't know what to do. I went to the doctors yesterday and they told me I had to come off my tablets as they can cause deformation on babies. Is there nothing else I can take? I know some people will say its not time to have kids if I suffer from anxiety but I feel once I have something to concentrate on I can help myself. I'm just scared of going cold turkey.
