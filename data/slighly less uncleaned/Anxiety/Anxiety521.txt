Fatigue and weakness from Xanax?I'm not 100% sure that this is from the Xanax, but it's the only thing I can think of. I take one half of a 1mg Xanax because the first time I took the whole thing, it literally wiped me out the point where I got dizzy and fell asleep. After that I stopped taking it for two weeks and started it again yesterday, but now I take a half. Both yesterday and today I have felt EXHAUSTED, and my whole body feels really weak, like getting up and walking requires so much effort. I think I may just stop taking it, I feel better without it. The weakness and fatigue lasts all day and I just feel strange. Is this possible from Xanax? I actually have my sweet 16 party tomorrow and don't want to feel like this for it.Not sure where to post this...fear of death?So when I was 12, my brother died in a car accident (he was 20). When he was a kid, his mom also died in a car accident when she was 20 (he's my half brother, we just share the same dad). Now I'm 20 and turning 21 next month, and I'm so scared. Ever since he died and I noticed the connection between him and his mom, I've been paranoid that the same thing is going to happen to me. He was speeding on a back road when he had his accident, but his mom was hit by someone else so I don't think it was her fault. Does anyone have experience with fears kind of like this? I'm not really sure what to do to calm my mind.Tense throat muscles crippling speechHello everyone! I've had major anxiety for the past 3 years and the main symptom I cannot take is inability to pronounce words. The anxiety will limit my vocal range so I cannot effortlessly say words like I used to.  From what I read it's due to larynx going into fight or flight and tensing up. The problem is it's always like this. I left my job because it's too hard to push the words out and I know something is wrong. Does anyone know how I can relax my throat muscles so I can pronounce words properly? Thank you in advance!
