What to do?Hi GuysIt's been a while since I've posted because everything has been Ok but suddenly my world seems to be falling apart.Just for background I'm 61 yrs old.It all started to go wrong in November when my wife's older sister had a heart attack and suggested that my wife have a checkup.It turned out that she had 3 blocked arteries and 2 stents were implanted.After seeing all this I decided to book in for a check up myself but had a heart attack in January before the appointment came around.I had one stent implanted.Just so you know we live 600 ks from Brisbane so while the wife's treatment was accomplished by a normal plane trip mine was by both ground and air ambulances.My wife had an appt for a checkup in January but missed it because of my attack.When she finally got to it in February it turned out that they had found a shadow on her right lung which meant back to Brisbane for a biopsy and surgery to remove one lobe of her right lung (she never smoked)All was going well but after 5 days she started to crash so it was back into theatre to remove another lobe.That was all about 9 weeks ago and she is recovering well.The trouble is now that we can't afford the payments on our home and will have to sell and rent somewhere.After having a home of my own (even if different ones) for the last 30+ yrs this is really upsetting especially as at our stage of life we can't just start over.My anxiety is sky high stopping me from sleeping and making me lethargic at work all day.I just can't see any answers in all of this but getting it off my chest may help.PS My Dr prescribed Xanax and it's the worst thing I've ever taken so I stopped.Been taking 2 x 5mg Valium for last 10 yrsPPS In the middle of all the hospital stuff my 12 yr old German Shepherd died suddenly.__________________Don't believe everything you think.Don't be afraid that your life will end, be afraid that it will never begin.
