Scared of dyingHi a bit strange I know but I am 55 with a 16 year old son, having him late in life means that we can give him a good start, but also means I will not be around for his later life. I am not usually anxious but have been since the menopause started and now have a couple of age related health issues. I am so panicked about dying before he at least sets himself up in life where he is settled and can get on without help. He typically say's we all die it's life and stop going on about it he will manage as he has his dad, but it is spoiling my enjoyment of life as I feel that it could also come crashing down any minute. I hate the thought of getting old and try to keep my outlook young. Does anyone know who I could talk to about this, my GP's are a no no as they are too busy to have the time. I have sort of tried, apart from this I am happy and not depressed, but I constantly think about how much longer I will be around, I wish there was some way of knowing. Please do not reply if you are going to tell me I am being stupid because I know how it sounds, I cannot help it.
