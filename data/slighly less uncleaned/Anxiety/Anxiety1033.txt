travel anxiety? sharing stories timeHi everyoneHere we go again, flying into Singapore and Malaysia in a few days. Most people would think I am crazy, in fact I do also... I have anxiety over being an unwitting drug mule. This is nothing new, I remember I tied a million knots in my bag when travelling through China twenty odd years ago. Now I find I travel only with a hard suitcase, but I go to the extreme... i recognise how ridiculous I am, but I have to literally take the suitcase apart and put it back together to make sure there are no drugs in the tubing or anything! As everyone here with an excessive ocd or some other condition, the issue is my mind wanders and it all becomes too real which drives me to do these checks. The reasoning is, not that anyone wants to 'plant' drugs like luggage handlers, I go to the point of what if they were transporting the drugs hidden in an item, you bought it, and then unknowingly travelled through customs with it. With it being asia, they dont seem to care how you got them as you are the one going through with it, so its up to you to prove you had nothing to do with it and even then best of luck if you are the unfortunate person who was in this positionso theres why i am crazy, how about you guys/gals?
