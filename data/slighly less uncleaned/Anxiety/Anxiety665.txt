very nerious about medication review todayIn two hrs ill be adviced to take new medication,after being on my meds for two years..phyciatrist appt at 2.30 to review my meds and there will be changes..in the past when i lived with my wife and kids,as i had someone there if i was feeling bad...not looking forward to this esp as in the past i was given new meds which made me worse and never got any better so ended up coming off them and restarting my old meds all over again..
