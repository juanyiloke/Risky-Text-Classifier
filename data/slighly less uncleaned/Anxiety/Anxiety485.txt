A Quote That Has Gotten Me Through Tough TimesWithout depression and anxiety, I would not be who I am; a person who can see humor in the smallest and least likely of things; appreciating others' kindness tenfold. When the black clouds of despair descend and life seems pointless, I try to remember that one day in the future, perhaps this very day, a gentle breeze will blow the clouds away and let the sunshine in. When that happens the world is a new and magical place and I wish to live forever. --Irene Grodeckichange in symptomsGood Evening everyone, Has anyone else had this happen.It was chest pains at first then after like getting to know this was panic anxiety develop a new symptom? I went to feeling like I could not breath! anyone else ever focus on the color of their lips thinking they look purple or they look pale all over even when everyone else says you look fine.I also check my fingernails for good color.I have even peeled nail polish off to see the index nail because someone told me that is how you check if you have good oxygen levels.I am the only person who does these things?Pregnant with anxietyWho else has dealt with it? I had it with my son that I was able to pull through with just counseling but this time around its much harder. Anxiety is there everyday and have been having a lot of anxiety attacks at night. I am seeing a counselor every 2 weeks and it really hasn't helped. I've been walking and trying All the natural remedies  but it's still lurking around. I'm scared of taking meds but I feel like that is the route I am going to have to take I'm so tired of feeling this way
