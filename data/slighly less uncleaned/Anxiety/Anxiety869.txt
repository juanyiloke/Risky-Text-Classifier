 Escitalapram for anxiety >>Hi all,just wondering how other people feel about escitalapram for anxiety?I have been on this now for nearly 6 weeks at 10mg - the first few weeks I felt god awful and had to take diazapam for the first week to take the edge off. I don't really feel it's had much of an impact, although maybe slightly taken the edge off my anxiety.I was previously on paroxatine and came off this about 4 years ago and felt this was more effective initially, although over time its effectiveness obviously started to diminish.I have had a few hypnotherapy sessions which I don't really feel have done a great deal, and am due to have my first CBT session on Monday so will see how that goes. Feel my anxiety is very deep routed (have been suffering since I was about 7 years old) so unsure how effective it will be.On week 6 of being off work and really need to go back, just extremely worried I'll end up going off sick again, so frustrating
