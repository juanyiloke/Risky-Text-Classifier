Just need some reassurance :)Hi Im all new to this but her it goes  Im a 24 year old woman and had my first ever full blown panic attack (out of the blue) 3 weeks   (ambulance out etc), always been a worrier but this has knocked me for 6. Im constantly having mini attacks now, it has changed me so much. Feel like Im going crazy, will never be the same again, struggling with the happy emotions and worrying about my health like never before. The doctor has now prescribed 20mg of propranolol to keep my heart rate down which has helped somewhat, just don't understand what happened so suddenly. Has any1 had a similar experience? Thank u. Jen
