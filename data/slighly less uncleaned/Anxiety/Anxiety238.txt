Anxiety like crazyI can't seem to get over my anxiety today. The other day I was so sick to my stomach, and had a low grade fever. Stomach issues got better but low grade fever has remained ever since. Still some slight stomach pain, and now my jaw hurts. Sleepy but I have a newborn so that's normal lol. I just can't get my mind to ignore the low grade fever. It's obsessed that the jaw pain means something is wrong. And now more random symptoms are trying to surface and I feel a panic attack on the horizon. Any suggestions?
