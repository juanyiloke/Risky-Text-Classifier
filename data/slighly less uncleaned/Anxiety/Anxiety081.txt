Something is wrong in my head Ê7    Four weeks back I had a very bad vertigo for which I had to get an emergency medical help after which doctor prescribed me vertin 16mg for my vertigo and advises me to visit ENT to check my ears which I did and found out nothing was wrong with my ears. Suddenly after couple of   I started having anxiety and started feeling restless. Again I went to the doctor and doctor asked me to do a series of test and all the test showed nothing, my anxiety is getting worse everyday and now I've been getting panic attack... I even visited psychiatric but nothing seems to work, I try to relax myself during these attacks but it does a little help and sometimes it doesn't.During these attack I feel as if I have something inside my head, my temple area gets heavy, I could feel movement inside my head and my heart pounds heavily, I feel like as if I'll pass out have a haemorrhage or may be bleed from my nose and die. Day by day thing is getting worse and I don't know what am I to do.
