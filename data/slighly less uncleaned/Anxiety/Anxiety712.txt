meds adviceHi all,Had anxiety for few years now and ive been coping ok with it. But recently started to stress alot more with work and general life. Ive noticed when i get stressed i get that swimming head sensation. I havent had this before this bad. Last night i was working in a busy bar and kept thinking i was going to pass out. So far i havent..touch wood..but it subsides after i relax. Is this blood pressure related? Could my BP rise?Or is it just anxiety? A sensation.What meds do you take for anxiety? Ive been avoiding this route but recently anxiety and stress are taking over my life.Thanks Sarah
