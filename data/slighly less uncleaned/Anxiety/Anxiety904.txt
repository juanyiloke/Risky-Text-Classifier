ÊHello EveryoneHi everyone. I'm new here. I came across this site in the App Store.ÊI am a stay at home mom of 5 and I have severe anxiety. I am here looking for support.ÊLately I have been experiencing my heart skipping beats. It's a horrible feeling and it really freaks me out. I have went to the hospital and they tell me I am having anxiety related PVCs.ÊI have given up caffeine as they have suggested. It hasn't helped any. Last night was probably the scariest night I've had in a while. I woke up from a deep sleep because it felt like my heart had just stopped. It felt like it wasn't going to start up again. I just say there panicking thinking this is the end. Finally it started beating but I hasn't been right since.ÊI know the doctors all say its anxiety but that doesn't make it any less scary. I've been to a psychiatrist and all he wanted to do was shove pills down my throat. He didn't even want to hear anything I had to say.ÊDoes anyone else experience anything like this?ÊThanks for listening.
