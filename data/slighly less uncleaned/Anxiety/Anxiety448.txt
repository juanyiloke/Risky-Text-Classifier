Venting! And hoping someone understandsI constantly feel like I have these ideas of perfection and its impossible for them to be met. I used to feel incredibly free in my relationships, and now suddenly im always anxious and I feel like I need certain things to be said to feel good. I worry so much over little opinions, like differences in music taste or tv show taste, because i'm afraid they indicate something bigger. I'm also afraid that maybe I care more if he makes mistakes sometimes, like leaving me when I was upset (even though he apologized) or other things that are too long to go into (they aren't deep or big issues, just don't feel like typing much more).ÊI just want to feel free again. I'm sick of almost setting up a stage so that things can happen exactly as I want them to so that I'll be reassured.Mold. Kind of ScaredSo yesterday,Êa few of the coffee cups came out of dishwasher and to me they smelled like mold. Mom said they smeled weird, but not sure it was mold. The cup I used smelled a little odd, not mold, I don't think. Anyways, I felt weird about so I dumped the coffee and we washed the cups again. But, now I am scared to use the coffee maker because the cup may have touched the spout and I don't want to get sick or something... Will I get sick?Approaching my Dr. The first timeHello. For those interested, I have made my first post in the introduction forum and now I have a question.I am fairly certain I have had GAD for sometime now (maybe years). I am getting up the courage to accept this and call my primary Dr. For help. I'm just not sure how to start. Do I simply call the office and tell the receptionist I have anxiety? I'm depressed? Just not feeling well?ÊSounds wimpy maybe but I'm afraid once I make the call I can't take it back. Fear of being labeled maybe? I don't know. Is this normal and is there any advice?Thank you so much.
