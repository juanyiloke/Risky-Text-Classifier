Non-stop GAD symptoms for month/years?I have been dealing with horrible anxiety and panics attacks for over 10 years now. I have noticed, after talking with many other people who also have anxiety issues, that my symptoms are not the norm of those that get "anxious".ÊMy symptoms are non-stop physical symptoms including buzzing (fluttering) and constricted chest and throat, pounding heartbeat, severe neck/back pain, head/face pressure, numbness, blurred vision, feelings of adrenaline pumping simultaneously with exhaustion, and depersonalization which then causes me to have major panic attacks because of the sensations I am getting. But, the symptoms are pretty much always there, every day, all day, no matter what. They come for no reason, even waking me up out of a dead sleep. Even when I take Xanax every day, the symptoms are there. I just care less about them because I am sedated. Certain medicines have worked for periods of time then stop working, sometimes after years of success.Most people tell me their symptoms come in waves of 5-30 minutes, but mine can last nonstop for months. Honestly, it feels like I am battling my body shutting down on a daily basis. Currently, this "episode" been going on every single day for 4 months and it is affecting every part of my life (I am starting to miss days of work and cannot drive to go see my family 3 hours away).ÊIs this all normally the case with GAD or is there a possibility that I am dealing with something else? It just seems the never ending intense symptoms are not typical, even of GAD. Please let me know if I am wrong!
