Arm started shaking after holding a baby?? Real Illness or stress/worry/anxiety? Scared!Hi all,So today, I have felt pretty "normal" overall. I had a pretty bad headache yesterday, but today it is gone, tingling I had in my feet was to a very minimum, had hardly any sort of floaters in my vision today, I have not experienced any whooshing sounds in my ear, I have been sleeping much better, etc. All of my "symptoms" began a month   after freaking out while reading on Dr. Google! Well today I was looking after this woman's little baby, and I had my arm propped up against the couch/pillow, and the babies weight was against my arm.. So basically my arm was smooshed. It was fine for a while, but then after maybe 20 minutes it started getting very uncomfortable and then my arm started shaking a lot and twitching! After I freed that arm up, it still did it for a while, maybe 40 minutes or so?? I did not have much time in the moment to get super nervous about it (this baby came first in this situation obviously) but now that it is over, I am really starting to think about it, and it freaks me out! I am so scared I have c****r or some autoimmune disease! Right when I feel that I am having a much more "normal" day, some sort of symptom appears that gets me feeling worried again!  like if the shaking arm had not happened, I would of had a really good day!  now, I am just scared and nervous again!
