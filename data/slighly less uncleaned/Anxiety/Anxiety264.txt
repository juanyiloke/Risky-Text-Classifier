how do i stop focusing on symphtomes? health anxietyIHi! I Hi! I think I have some kind of health anxiety. I am not afraid of deadly diseases but of allergy and it has become kind of OCDish. One thing that is very stressing is that I _constantly_ scan my body for allergic reactions and also have a lot of itching which I obsess with. It gets better when I am busy with for example work but it's always there. And as I am aware of this psychological fact that physical symptoms get worse when you are obsessed with them I wonder if anyone here has any tips on how to stop that?ÊLove From me to you all <3
