Obsession/attachment/addiction over a friend?help. Ê12    Hi there,this is my story,me 25y male and my friend 24y female,we are friends for over 1 year,all good untill 3 weeks   when i started to have some feelings over her,i think its an obsession.The thing is lately i miss her alot,think alot about her,im kinda needy i need attention from her,when i hang out with her i feel so good like im high and when im not with her or we don't talk on facebook i feel a little empty.Another thing that tell me its obsession its that i enjoy to help her if i can,like im addicted to her,to be needed,sometimes im sad to think that in one day she will not need any help for me,so selfish here yeah i know.Another thing is im not attracted to her in a romantic way,she even have an boyfriend and im ok with that im never jealous when she is with him,im happy for her because i know she love him alot and also him love her much.I just want to be friends like we used to be.I really don't want to cut her from my life forever she didn't do anything wrong,she is a good friend and always helped me if she could,oh man so many good memories,so many nice things that we did together.Maybe someone can help me to cut this obsession....I   on another forum to but noone replied.
