Depersonalisatio, derealisation, anxiety!!HI all!I've been suffering from the above since October, but just need to post on here as I'm getting so frustrated!Even though I've had this pretty much constant since October, it feel like it gets worse and worse, then I'll have a good week, then spiral again for no apparent reason at all? I persistently feel tripped out and since Monday, I've had constant deja vu, like constant! It last all day long, it feel like I've lived that exact day before etc, and it's really horrible. I'm currently having cbt, and told her that last week was great and now I'm feeling detached, unreal, constant deja vu, feel stuck in my own body lol etc And she doesn't understand why I spiral and everything goes pear shaped - but then neither do I!!! I'm just tripped out all day long, please help!! ?
