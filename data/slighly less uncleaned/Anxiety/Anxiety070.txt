is this general anxiety or something worse? Ê6    Hi, IÊsuffer from anxiety and sometimes it can get really bad. Based on my symptoms i wondered if people could let me know if this is a generally anxiety issue or whether it is something more serious.I will panic about most things on a day to day basis. It could be a bout the most basic things did I turn my straightners of or did I lock the front door. But a lot of the time, my mind goes into overdrive. i could be sat somewhere and will be thinking of every possibility the situation IÕm currently in could go wrong (could someone die, could someone get injured, what if I did whatever IÕm doing wrong, the list goes on). My mind is constantly going through every possible scenario. It also comes down to being on my own and not physically trying to kill myself but I could be waiting for the train and a voice in my head just goes Òjust walk in front of it, just do it".I hate the way that I am and that I can do normal things without over thinking the ways it can go wrong.Please can someone tell me if this is something more serious then I originally thought?
