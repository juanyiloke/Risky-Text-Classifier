Can't stop talking to myself due to anxietyHi,Over the last several years I have developed the habit of talking to myself. It is always triggered by an anxious thought. One I have the though I feel anxious then I blurt out a word or phrase or short sentence. The words typically related to my sexuality, which has caused me much anxiety over the years. I don't know its going to happen prior to it happening. I often catch myself about to do it and I stop, or just just start to say something and then stop. It developed during a period of my life when I was very anxious and depressed, after one of my parents died. I went through another tough time due to work stress about a year ago and it was happening 100+ times a day at its peak. Now its just like 5 to 15 times a day. How do I stop this? Please help.
