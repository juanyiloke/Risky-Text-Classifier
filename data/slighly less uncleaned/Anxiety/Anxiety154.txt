No one to talk to...  13    Two years   I suffered from depression and anxiety, came out the other side and only had one ‘blip’ since then, so I know my symptoms and the CBT I need to do to help myself but find myself a little stuck now.I’m 30, in a job I like (which can be a bit stressful sometimes but nothing too bad) and living at home saving for a place of my own.  I have my   where anxiety gets on top of me but I don’t like showing it to people when it happens.  I know it makes it worse but I just can’t.  I’m really good a putting on a face to everyone, even professionals, which sounds stupid as I’ve had help before and know I shouldn’t hide it.Things are starting to slip up now and I don’t think I have a trigger.  I don’t know what constitutes a panic attack but I seem to cry uncontrollably in mine and hyperventilate, my thoughts escalate and I can’t always control them and then I’m mentally exhausted afterwards.  Not great when I’m at work and try to continue as normal afterwards.  I always put it down to feeling low but now I think it might be anxiety instead of depression.  I wake up in the night, suffer headaches, shake or hold myself really tight.  But not always.Anyway the point of this message is: I’m considering seeing a doctor about it but I’m torn.  On one side I want them to say I have GAD so I have a reason to be acting so irrationally and I can then do something about it.  On the other I don’t want to be put on drugs and I don’t want to put my work/home life at risk by having an official diagnosis.  I also don’t think I’m really ‘ill’ enough to have anything done, like I haven’t quite reached tipping point where I should be seeking help; even though I breakdown whilst doing things, I always pull myself back together before anyone else sees me so surely it’s not so bad?  If I was really ill I wouldn’t be able to do that?I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this, so hoping the anonymous internet can help.  Thanks for reading.
