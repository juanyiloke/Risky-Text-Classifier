Mind still not right citalopramwell here I am again hoping somebody somewhere has experienced this ! I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression in January after a relapse of my m.s and being in hospital for stomach pain for which they found no reason and becoming suicidal , since then I have been on sertraline amitryptiline cymbalta and trazadone , none of which suited me ! I started on citalopram 3 Êweeks   and although my depression seems to have lifted my anxiety is through the roof ! Along with this my mind feels foggy along with my eyesight , I get confused easily and can't concentrate , I wake up with stomach churning every day , everything takes so much effort and I am really forgetful , forgetting appointments , conversations etc , I am even scared to drive and get frustrated when thinking about doing things , I'm scared this isn't normal ....... Am I going mad ? Or do I need sectioning ??
