please please help. chest pains... Ê9    I haven't   anything for a while..could really do with some advice though.I can't get to sleep because of chest pains and I would normally confide in my partner but he's had a really long day and I don't want to disturb his sleep.I constantly get chest pain though it tends to be worse in an evening.I was just laying here browsing the Web and I've suddenly started getting chest pain on the left behind my left breast. It's like a pressure but with a sharp twinge that keeps coming and going that's quite uncomfortable. I do suffer with anxiety and worry about dying from a heart attack (my father had one recently)i have been to my doctors regularly as I've been so worried but they say nothing is wrong. But these pains are very real. I really could just use some advice. Please? X
