what happened? racing heart after alcohol.I'll just start by saying I have a history of anxiety issues and panic attacks. I rarely ever get then anymore but lately I've had a couple because I've been under a lot of stress. I haven't slept well the last 2 days. Maybe 2 hours yesterday and a few hours last night. Just couldn't stop my mind from thinking about stuff.ÊSo today I got a gatorade and poured 2 shots of vodka in it and drank it in about 15-20 mins. I had a bit of a buzz and I got a cigarette from this guy and smoked it. I very rarely ever smoke... After I smoked it i sat down and noticed my heart was goin pretty fast. I tend to obsessively check my pulse sometimes. The pulse was normal and steady but fast and I felt pretty "wired" which I'd a feeling I don't like. I used my heart rate app and checked my pulse and it was 105-110 and all I was doing was just sitting... I kept checking it for about 15 minutes straight trying to get it back to normal. Finally the wired feeling started going away a bit and I checked it and focused on my breathing and it was 89, still sitting down.ÊWhat could have caused this rapid rate? The lack of sleep? Anxiety? I read online about svt and this holiday heart syndrome stuff and it freaks me out. I rarely drink anymore these days. My resting pulse is pretty low Btw at 50-55. I'm 25 years old 150 lbs. I juice vegetables everyday and take fish oil.
