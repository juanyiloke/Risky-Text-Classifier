Urges to lose or drop stuff out an open window.This is something that is evident when it comes to a gadjet like my phone so I cannot leave my house with my phone otherwise I will be nervous of having my phone held out the window by myself and it slips out my hand then it gets run over.This is something that I have had for over a month does anyone have any suggestions I have tried leaving with my phone but standing or sitting out in the front when inside a bus but I still feel nervous that I will creep over to an open window also when the bus is packed there is no way you can sit or stand at the front.Its not just the phone though its also my oyster card too.I have actually held my phone out the window in the last month or so. What can I do about this.Ê
