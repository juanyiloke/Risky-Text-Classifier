Being worried and anxious about almost everythingA week ago, I was daydreaming at my balcony (I stay at a flat that is 20+ storeys high)I feared that I may accidentally hold a hanger in my hand, from the clothes rack, and accidentally throw it down killing someone, though I did not hear any ambulance.But I do not remember taking a hanger, I just fear that I may be unconsciously done it because I was daydreaming.Also, I am paranoid about imaginary deadly parasites may get into my body, If I have touched something with fungi, or anything that looks 'dirty'.At school while doing a practical, on twisted wires, a friend was snipping something, and standing above me (I was sitting),I feared that wires may get into my eye without me knowing, slowly hurting my eye, causing me to be blind.I also fear getting about certain chemicals like soap and detergent mixing and causing breast cancer, etc.(If clothes are in a sink,soap chemicals touch sink and washing the clothes in detergent)HELP...I'm going crazy..I know my thoughts are irrational, and doesn't make sense, but I can't trust my mind, I fear alot.I know all this fears are related and I do have paranoid genes.I want to hear opinions, and how to solve this. Thinking of therapy.
