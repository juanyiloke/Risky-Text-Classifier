dealing with anxietyHi guys i am new to this site. I'm 23 years old but my anxiety has made me feel like i am way older. I know i should be worrying about where i'm going to go this weekend or what i'm going to wear...like most 23 year olds my age do. But, instead of worrying about those types of things, i find myself worrying about every type of disease possible, and i convince myself that i have every single one of them. I get minor aches and pains, but i also work 40 hours a week standing and bending 8 hours a day. Even though i know aches and pains are normal, i convince myself that it's something worse. I'm absolutely terrified of getting any type of cancer or any other horrible sad disease. If i read something online about someone dying, i automatically think "oh my god what if i have that". Most weeks i can keep a handle on my anxiety and calm myself down, but this past week was horrible. I was crying at work, unhappy, scared, and terrified. My friends and boyfriend think im ridiculous, and i can't blame them because i would get annoyed if someone kept saying they had something wrong with them if i didnt know what it was like to have anxiety. The thing they don't understand is that you can't just turn the switch off and not have anxiety anymore. I know it's so rare for someone my age to develop a disease like cancer, but it can happen to anyone at any age. I don't smoke or do any drugs, and i dont drink alot of alcohol either, just the occasional beer or mixed drink out at dinner, and a couple of drinks at special events. I just feel stuck.Ê
