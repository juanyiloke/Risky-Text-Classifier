Will eating healthy reduce my anxiety? Ê12    Throughout my life i havent really always eaten healthy foods too much. I usually eat things that are high in sugar because honestly thats what tastes good. I always drink sodas and other drinks with caffiene and I have read that caffiene actually helps bring on anxiety and panic attacks. So, from now on I'm going to eat healthy foods, avoid sugar and caffiene, and also exercise daily. Maybe i'll even try yoga.Do you think changing to a more healthy lifestyle will reduce my anxiety and put a hault on the physical symptoms? Has this worked for any of you? Im 18 by the way.Thanks xx- Gabbi
