How does one deal with this... possible triggers.Not 100% sure where to post this, but I figured here probably wouldn't hurt.I suffer from a whole slew of anxiety related problems, and I'm also a huge introvert. I've just started climbing out of this hole when I get a huge bomb dropped on me that a dear friend some states away is on ***** watch. I've since had contact with said person but i obviously can't be there for them physically, and it feels like a huge weight has been placed on my shoulders because I am one of their only lifelines, and I'm already struggling to keep my own head above the water and keep it together for my family. It's all very exhausting. I can be woken up in the middle of the night by texts and phone calls and of course I take them because I'm terrified of what might happen if I don't, but I am so weary and frayed...ÊAnyone have any suggestions, advice, or sage wisdom to share?
