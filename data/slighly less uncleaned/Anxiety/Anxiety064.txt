Dealing with anxiety! Ê6    So, I'm 23 years old and work full-time and have had a sudden onset of anxiety symptoms since the beginning of this year (2015). January was a particularly bad month, and some  /weeks are better than others. I'm almost 100% sure this is work related anxiety and there is a particular event which seems to be my focal point (took on a more demanding job, jumped up 2 pay grades and big cultural difference!).My symptoms usually are only in the morning when I wake up for the first hour or so. I feel like I've got a brick on my chest, that my hearts beating quicker than normal and generally feel really stressed and anxious about the day ahead. It seems silly to say that usually when I get to work, I feel okay! I'm not sure if "morning anxiety" and/or "anticipatory anxiety" are a thing but that's how I'd categorize it. I don't want to consider going to my GP at this point as I don't feel its severe enough to start putting medication in my system and having read a lot of forums they always seem to make it a lot worse before it gets better!I guess I just wanted to hear from people who may experience similar anxiety to me? This is completed new to me and I hate the sense of loss of control, lack of confidence etc.
