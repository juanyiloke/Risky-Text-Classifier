ÊAnxious about not being Anxious??Hey,I have been suffering from severe anxiety for a long time now and looking back I can see a lot of improvement to where I was about 4 years ago with my anxiety.I just wanted to know if its normal to get so use to being "anxious" when use to having it constantly - that when a moment comes of being calm and "not anxious" and actually not thinking a "million miles per hours" occurs and I feel at peace and can breathe and think clearly - Scares me because I am not use to it?This has only started happening in the past couple weeks - about once a day for 5minutes - But does not last long because I end up in panic and high anxiety about not feeling anxious and begin to have a mild panic attack because I don't know whats going on, and not use to that feeling?This is confusing for me - hopefully it makes some kind of sense!
