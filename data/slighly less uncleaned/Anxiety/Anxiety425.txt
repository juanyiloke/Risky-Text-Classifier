constant anxious repetitve worries/thoughtsI just started 50 mg of tofranil two days ago and really hoping this really settles me down a bit. But anyways I've had these constant repetitive worry after worry after worry that pop into my head over and over all day and just snowball and I get lost in it and I feel hopeless of ever getting out of this which makes me more anxious and then resulting hopeless. I have created so many bad thougjt patterns over the past 3 years but I feel the old me still has to be under this somewhere. My question is , is it really as bad or as serious as it feels, or when I correctly start to address the anxiety itself with meds or whatever will these thoughts not scare me as much and as a result fade away and give me some relief.... I can't live like this much longer something has to give. It's all mental at this point the physical symptoms don't even bother me much it's just the lost in my thoughts feeling and never getting my mind back to normal is what scares me. Can u get too lost in your mind or is this just anxiety playing tricks on me? Is it too severe to expect recovery or even just somewhat normal? I really hope I didn't dig myself in too deep here mentally... any experiences of this kind of thing getting better cuz it just keeps getting worse day by day for me and I feel so distanced from my true self
