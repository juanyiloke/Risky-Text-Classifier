Staying in bed for hoursHeyAm I the only person it happens to?Every morning (noon actually) when I should have got out of bed hours before and I'm still in bed, I keep thinking about all the demanding things I will have to do in the hours left from the day. I will have to struggle with the need to study for the exams, I will have to get out of bed in the somewhat cold whether, and so on.I'm think it's related to anxiety. It frightens me to know how much I still have to study in so many subjects. To know that I don't have much time and I have to hurry up and go to the college, to know that the exams are close and it is up to me to pass them, and so on.So it keeps me in bed, trying to get just some more minutes (or hours) of peace. I don't even feel tired.I never get up in the morning!!Does this happen to you to? What can I do to stop this avoidance? My life is derailed.Thanks so much
