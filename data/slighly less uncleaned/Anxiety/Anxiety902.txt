I always feel like something bad is going to happen :(I am starting to manage my anxiety and I'm somewhat managing my worries. I just always have this feeling something bad is going to happen >.> I ALWAYS expect the worst. Realistically my life is going fine right now but I still have that feeling that something bad will happen. I'm jumpy as hell and I'm just always expecting something bad to happen.The house phone started ringing an hour ago and I automatically thought that it was awful news (we don't normally get phone calls this late) It was just my nan reminding my dad to pick up her prescription >.>I'm on medication by the way, I'm on 200mg of Sertraline and 30mg of Mirtazapine. It's not normal to feel this way whilst taking such high dosages of these drugs >.>
