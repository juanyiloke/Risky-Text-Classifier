Symptoms.... Sharing mine and tell me yours!What types of symptoms do you guys have? All of this started about a month   for me after googling tingling feet and freaking joy when I saw some of the results, I had a couple weeks where I literally could barely function, and while it's getting better, I am more myself, I still have many various symptoms. Still crazy to think that about 4-5 weeks  , I was totally "normal" acting!ÊThe ones I currently have had in recent   are:Do you guys have any similar symptoms? What do you guys experience, and how long does it last for y'all? I am going to visit with my GP later in the month and discuss this stuff, and pretty much everyone around me says they will find nothing wrong. Sometimes I am convinced of that too, but them at other times I will still completely lose it! Really frustrating, huh?
