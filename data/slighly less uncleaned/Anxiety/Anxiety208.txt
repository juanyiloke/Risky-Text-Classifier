I really need some help hereHey everyone i hope everyone is doing well. Well a few years ago my doctor said i had rhinitis sinusitis with an unknown cause along with a deviated septum. I was given a nose spray which at the time seemed to work. I also have a CT scan of my head to check for things which all came back clean. Its come back with more discomfort than ever. I have severe head pressure on my temples, above and below my eyes, and on top of me teeth. I also feel dizzy and off balance alot, along with what seems to be eye fatigue. Its difficult for me to concentrate on anything without squinting. A little over a week ago i was told i had a sinus infection so i was put on antibiotics. The meds seemed to help me feel better, until they ran out. I ran the course of the meds and here i am feeling worse than ever. I have an appointment with a allergist in a few weeks but i am absolutely miserable. I also have health anxiety which doesnt help. I cant help but think there is something growing in my head like a tumor or its cancer or something. I just cant believe that this much discomfort could come from sinus issues. I feel unhappy and miserable 100% of the time and i simply cant enjoy life anymore. I dont know what to do and i am currently freaking out. Can anyone relate or tell me im not going crazy?
