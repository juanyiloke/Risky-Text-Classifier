Sudden reappearance...Hey all,I have been managing my anxiety really well these past few months. I haven't been working freelance like I did before (I hate the travelling and the uncertainty) and have either been at home or working at a company close by for a month. I've actually been quite happy which is so strange for me!However now it's gotten to the point where I really need money to pay rent and whilst my stress is still manageable about this because it's a logical issue, today it came back full force when I took on a 2 day freelance job.2 days I hear you say? That's not much. And it isn't. But it takes over 2 hours to drive there and I've never felt particularly confident when I've been there before. However I need the money so when she called me last minute I took it. As soon as I did take it I didn't want to do it, but I knew I had to so I tried to forget about it for the night.I woke up this morning and wham. Instant sinking feeling in my throat. Almost overwhelming, I wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. Me being me, I got up. I forced a tiny bit of breakfast down my throat. I hugged my boyfriend to try to make myself feel better. I hugged my cats to make myself feel better. I left the house and trudged to my car feeling like a truck was balancing on my shoulders and a ball of worry was sitting in my throat.20 minutes into my 2 hour plus journey after crawling along the motorway, my IBS decided to say hi. The cramps started coming, I started to feel even more panicky and stressed. I wanted to cry and turn back but I need the money. I called my boyfriend who told me to go home, that the money wasn't worth my illness.So I turned back. Ran to the loo as soon as I got home. Now I'm sitting in the lounge feeling very on edge and guilty... I need that money but I haven't felt this awful in a long time.
