Need help with anxiety medication SertralineSo a while back I got prescribed Sertraline because of anxiety that I have been experiencing for a good few years now and the doctor told me not to read the side effects as it will probably put me off taking them, so of course the first thing I did was looked at the side effects and seen things about cancer, hallucinations ect. this has caused me to not take my medication and resulted in me not being able to do things I should be doing like work and going out.I would be grateful if anyone who has taken these before can give an idea of any feelings or things that happend to you during your time taking SertralineThanks!
