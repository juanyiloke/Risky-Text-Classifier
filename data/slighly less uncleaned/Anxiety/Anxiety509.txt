Welcome back anxiety!This past weekend I went to lunch with my dad, my mom and my sister.Ê My dad just found out his hairy cell leukemia is back.Ê We all attempted to talk about it but we were all so uncomfortable and I could feel the anxiety radiating from each one of us.Ê My dad kept saying what if this time it doesn't work and I kept yelling at him and reminded him he has been through it twice he will get through it a third time(I literally felt like dying inside).Ê My dad looks incredibly pale, he usually is bright red and he just looks so pale and tired right now.Ê The worst part is he doesn't get his bone marrow tested until the 22nd...this is such a long lengthy process it sucks.Ê Then my mom brought up if we could get tested to see if we had a gene that could tell us if we the kids could get hairy celled leukemia.Ê My dad didn't know and didn't sound like he cared to question it to the doctor, so now we won't know.Ê I need to see if I can get in contact with his doctor to ask him.Ê I feel like I am more mature than my parents sometimes.Ê It's so hard to try to be the strong one.Ê I'm really struggling with my anxiety right now and my husband is being very difficult.Ê I am a person who does it all and well lately I get home from work and I don't want to cook dinner so he gets mad at me.Ê Then we argue for a bit and he tells me he will leave me alone for the night.Ê Ugh I can't do everything right now I just can't and I wish someone would just yell at my husband for me and say support your wife better. Grrrrrr!
