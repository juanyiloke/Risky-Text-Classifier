What is wrong with me, someone please help :(  18    Iv suffered from depression for 4 years but its never been as bad as this. Lately i keep having a pain in my chest like a heart attack, i find it hard to breath and get upset really easily when someone tells me off for example: my  boyfriend who I care for dearly and means loads to me came in from work, i have cleaned the flat and made sure everythings nice for when he comes home but i forgot to feed the cat at 5 and he had a little go at me, and i couldnt breath and started getting really upset... Iv never been this bad, what is wrong with me, please someone help
