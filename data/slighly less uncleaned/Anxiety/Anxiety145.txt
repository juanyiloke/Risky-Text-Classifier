Question for all Ê12    How many of us can put our hand on our heart and say, with certainty, that we can let go of our anxieties?I think this a vital and fascinating question.I maintain my stance that anxiety energy will happily leave us when we allow it. The problem is that we and our issues have become so attached that we don't know how to realise the destructive energy.I know from experience that we are not taught to let go. Society has become all about attaining things then keeping hold of what we have. When we have something we don't want we have no idea of how to release it.I wonder what others think of this.
