Getting over phobiasI didn't quite know where to post this because there's no specific category for phobias on the forum (except social phobia). I recently switched gears in counseling and I'm starting to work on some of the tougher issues that I have with my anxiety. One of them is phobias.ÊI'm not going to sit here and list of everything that I seem to have a phobia of because it will take up tons of space and won't really accomplish much of anything. I did however want to see if anyone has any tips on how they have dealt with or gotten over their phobias.
