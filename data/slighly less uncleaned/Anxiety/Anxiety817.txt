Fear of time running out and getting olderI'm not really sure this is the right forum for this, so please forgive me if it isn't I just want to get this off my chest and see if anyone else knows this feeling. so here goes: I am aware that I am still quite "young" (24), but ever since I was a teenager, I've been afraid of getting older and time passing, if that makes any sense. I'm somehow scared of time running out..... there have always been a few dates during the year that particularity trigger that fear (birthday, end of year, end of summer/beginning of new school & academic year), but somehow it's always lurking in the back of my mind anyways. I'm not sure I can explain what exactly it is I'm afraid of. I feel that the older I get, or the more time is passing, the less time I have left to do/experience things and achieve something in my life. and that freaks me out!!!! it's kind of ironic, though, given the fact that I'm not exactly doing much. I haven't had any professional help (yet), but I have been suffering from depressions (my own diagnosis as a layperson) for years now. hence, I'm not really an active person, I don't have many social contacts, I feel extremely insecure and uncomfortable around people I don't know well, etc. So all of that makes my fear even worse, cause I feel like I am waisting time......can anyone relate to that?
