Is it time for meds?Like many people here, I live with constant anxiety. Getting through the day can be challenging, then I go home to try to escape the day's negative thoughts.I see a psych for bipolar disorder. He's always been reticent to prescribe an anti anxiety med. He thinks my other meds do a good job of controlling my bp symptoms, and I should try other means of controlling anxiety.I try those other means but obviously not hard enough. It seems like a hopeless battle.When do you know it's time for anti anxiety meds?
