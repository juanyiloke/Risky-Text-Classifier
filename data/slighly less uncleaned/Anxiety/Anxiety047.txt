I've been getting really bad anxiety/panic attacksHi, about once or twice a day I just start getting a feeling were I need to increase my breathng rate then all of a sudden I feel like I can't breathe/catch my breath so I then start Panicing  an then comes the dreaded worry and panic which I try to contain but I just can't, the annoying thing is I get these panic attacks because I think about past ones and I can't seem to shake it off, I've never been diagnosed with anxiety as such but from a lot of personal experience I know exactly what it is. So I was wondering if anyone maybe had some suggestions on how to help with this or better ways of calming myself down, thanks plus I am 18 years old male
