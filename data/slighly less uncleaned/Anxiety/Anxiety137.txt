Could this be anxiety? terrified ive got MS or a brain tumour :(  13    HiJust wondering if someone could help? I don’t know whether the symptoms im having could be just anxiety or whether im actually ill? Worried sick about my symptoms (I know i have health anxiety) but ive had these symptoms on and off since July 2014. It all started when I was at work last July and I heard a buzzing in my ear (actually thought there was a bee next to my head). Then I felt woozy and I kept waking up with ringing in my ears and headaches. The doctor thought it might be labyrinthitis and started me on medications but they made me feel worse and I didn’t persevere with them.Intermittent lightheadedness (not actual room spinning or anything just a woozy feeling) which makes me feel a little sick sometimesBurning/heavy feeling in right lower calf (intermittent, usually when ive been thinking about it)Headaches (wake up with a headache in the corners of my eyes most mornings). Never feel refreshed and feel exhausted.Breathlessness (I have asthma though)I never have the panic attack symptoms that Ive read about like racing heart but sometimes I get so worked up thinking about these symptoms I just feel impending doom and that im gonna die. I end up crying my eyes out and feeling like I cant breathe and this can last for ages ?Last year these symptoms died down and then re-appeared a few weeks   (with the leg burning) and im terrified. Ive had a brain CT which was normal and im having an MRI scan tomorrow but im panicking about it because im literally past myself thinking ive got MS or a brain tumour or some other debilitating disease. Id love to be told my symptoms were due to anxiety so that I can just learn to ignore them.Help. Opinions anyone?
