How to cope with mom who has GAD without trigering my own GShe is 89 years old.  And has a lot of health and other problems.  She has also been a negative person my whole life.I feel stressed and unsettled after talking to her on the phone.  I call her every other day.  Majority of the time the conversation lasts only five - fifteen minutes. Which is short.  But still is emotionally hard for me.  My GAD is  sort of controlled with medication.  She is also on meds but they don't help a lot.  She won't try any new meds.  Hasn't beenwilling to try new ones even in her middle age years.  Whatever she was on then she stayed with.getting anxious about dental impressions for invisalign...I've been doing very well. I used to have perfectly straight teeth but the last few years I've been clenching at night and they've slowly shifted to the point that I really have to do something about it.The Orthodontist that I want to use does not have an iTero Scanner (he uses putty mold impressions!). This is the thing that's got me anxious. I have sensory issues and it's hard enough getting dental X-rays.... I've been trying to desensitize myself by watching videos of people getting impressions taken.Has anyone had invisalign and impressions? What does the impressions feel like?

I could go to a different ortho who has the scanner but the ortho I want to go to is highly recommended. Thanks. Sorry this is so long....    Resources to speak clearly and slower?Hi guys, I've been dealing with this for years. Pretty much, whenever I talk, I sound rushed and anxious. And my heart starts to beat faster and I sometimes find it hard to speak due to lack of energy or anxiety. Are there any books that may help with this kind of anxiety? I have a hard time remembering to breathe deeply in public and slow my speaking down. Thanks in advance!
