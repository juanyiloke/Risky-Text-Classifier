back pain - anxiety? Ê9    I've had lower back pain for a couple of weeks now. My skin is warm to touch and its a dull, burning ache pain. Its now radiated up my back. I don't know whether its real or an anxiety symptom.I do need to lose some weight which may help and also have a 1 year old who I should probably carry less. My Gp thinks its muscular and has given naproxen but I'm not sure.
