Feeling OddI think my problems are that I worry about what other people think of me too much. Basically I’m scared off everything and I don’t know why. I have a major complex about looking stupid. I’m afraid of making mistakes. I’m paranoid about my body language where I think I have to look perfect. I worry about speaking in certain ways and using good vocabulary because it reminds me of my uncle. My uncle is an alcoholic and also highly intelligent and speaks using good vocabulary but has made nothing of his life and he still lives at home at the age of 56. I worry about speaking because I speak too fast and sometimes people don’t understand me. I stutter sometimes when trying to communicate to certain people. I get nervous when talking to people. I worry about flirting with girls at work because I get scared of any rumours. I keep thinking that I’m not really making enough effort with girls at all. When people ask me questions about myself I get an almost uncontrollable urge to gag and throw up. I don’t really want to talk to any body at work at the moment . I feel dreadfully shy sometimes and I hate it, at my age I shouldn’t be. I feel as though I have done something terribly wrong and that I should be punished for it. I use to force myself to drink beer and then throw it back up again. My main problem now is my throat and the gag reflex. When people ask me certain questions I almost want to be sick compulsively. I blush to easily. I think I have some kind of social phobia and although I am seeking help I wanted to see peoples advice on here as well just to see what people say
