Feelings of an anxious mind vs. reality...I'm still struggling with my brain not functioning right and it is stressing me out! I'm tired of not being able to read, write, spell, think clearly, or verbalize my thoughts without constantly making errors. I'm starting to think maybe these increased dysfunctions are not from the discontinuation of the Prozac.ÊIt was suggested to me that the issues I'm having are all psychosomatic, and that my anxious mind is creating all of these impairments. I don't think that's true, if it was then I'd just be able to think I wasn't having the problems and they'd go away. But they don't, in fact what they do is get worse everyday!ÊEven a week ago, I feel my brain was functioning better than it is today. My husband tells me it's not possible. He says "Tell me one thing you could do last week that you can't this week?". I can still do everything I did last week, it's just harder!!ÊIt's like nobody understands how serious this is. My brain, which I need to do EVERYTHING, is not functioning. I'm tired of hearing that I'm making things worse by constantly analysing mistakes I'm making. It's an all day everyday thing! I wish I was just able to overlook all of these things.ÊWithout my mind functioning how can I ever expect to live a happy normal life? Can anyone here relate to symptoms I'm having? I am sorry for posting again..but I just don't know what to do!
