so hopeless feel too far gone/lost in my mind and thoughtsI'm at the point where I'm barely functioning, my mind is so twisted with the GAD it consumes my every thought and I don't see how this can possibly ever heal for me. I am convinced I am to far gone in my own mind to be fixed by any medication or therapy. Every single minute of my day is consumed by GAD I can't think straight everything I think about has an anxious spin on it it just seems to deep and I truly don't beleive anyone can understand how deep this condition is imprinted in my brain. I don't know what to do I'm pretty close to admitting myself to the hospital. I've dug myself so deep over the past 3 years I don't see how I'll ever get out. Am I as messed up as I feel, am I to far gone and beyond help? I'm at a loss of words and honestly don't know what to do anymore
