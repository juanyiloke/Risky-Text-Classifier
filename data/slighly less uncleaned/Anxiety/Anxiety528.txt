Any Book Recommendations?I've been dealing with anxiety for about 2 years now. I'm 21 and fairly active with an extremely overactive mind which ends in a mild panic attacks and depression.Ê I really dont make enough money to go to a psychologist. Me and my wife live in a rural area so the few that are here are veryyyy old and I feel may not be "up with the times" (if you knew where I live you'd understand that that is a completely rational fear hahah) or new and trendy and extremely pricey. Around $125-$175 per visit with a mandatory first time patient fee of $200 on top of the hourly fee. I simply cant afford it. I exercise to cope mainly. It helps when I stay at it. My problem is that I have too much time to think. I deliver milk so Im driving most of the day and avoiding people the rest of the time. Any good books out there that have really helped you? I HATE the term "self help" but honestly I'm out of avenues. Thanks!
