to shy to even talk to Samaritans? Ê11    i actually tried to ring samartians crying feeling the need to talk to someone a man answered i said hello then he said hello then i said it again so did he then i hanged up... i just figured these people really don't care in reality and i just felt so awkward i didnt know what to do my parents are always lurking and i have no pivacy anyway my dad came out and in anger asked what i was doing i get treated like a kid as i still live at home its hard because i honestly feel traped if im unhappy i have no one i can talk to really i have my boyfriend but even he can;t be there all the time and i think he sometimes gets annoyed with me.. i just cant beielve i cant even talk to someone who is meant to be a helpline i just cant get the words out and end up hanging up...
