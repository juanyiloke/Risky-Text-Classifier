How do you manage the day with anxiety?? Ê10    I'm 19 years old and regularly healthy but unfournately i have terrible anxiety. I have been suffering with it for 3 years now but only over the last 4 months it has gotten really uncontrollable. I have been to the hospital twice after checking myself in for what i believed to be a heart attack or some sort of defect but it was just the physical manifestations of my anxiety. Every day i have chest pain under my breastbone and i'm constantly checking my pulse to sort of reassure myself that i am ok. Any little twitch in my body or anything that could represent something wrong (such as feeling dizzy when standing up) i'm normally stressing out for a while after. The whole day from when i wake up to when i'm going to sleep i'm in constant fear that i am just going to drop dead. The anxiety only consumes me on certain occasions maybe once every week where all i can do is just pace up and down my hallway or somewhere for at least 30mins for it to go away again. I never experience the feeling of i can't breathe just a rapid heart rate that terrifies me. So my anxiety is at a point where it is just nagging me all day about something being wrong but never overwhelms me too much. I manage to go to college but on my really bad   i sometimes have to leave and go home just out of irrational fear. I think my girlfriend of 1 year is getting tired of me because of how much I have changed as a reasonable and fun boyfriend and the fact that i can't do all the things she would like because i'm honestly just to scared to put myself out there, or when i do i'm not exactly an enjoyable person to be with because of my nervous energy.I would just Êreally like to hear some stories about what it feels like for you and how you have managed to cope with it. I just like hearing personal opinions on anxiety because it makes me feel that i'm not alone and there is people out there who are understanding of the condition
