ÊWhat does "trouble relaxing" actually mean?I have to fill in a form requesting therapy for OCD, and it includes a screening questionnaire about depression (the PHQ9), and one about GAD, called the GAD-7. Now, I know I don't have GAD and I'd rather they didn't waste their time trying to work out if I do. I want to fill it in accurately, but most of the questions seem to be asking the same thing which makes me doubt I'm understanding them correctly.ÊIn particular, what does it mean in the context of GAD to have "trouble relaxing"? I'm sorry if this sounds really stupid, but it can't be about restlessness because there's a separate question about that, and it can't be about worrying or anxiety because there are multiple other questions about that. Does it mean that you don't want to do anything for just fun, like watch TV or have a bath, because you're too busy doing something practical? Or does it mean that not having anything important to do to distract yourself, makes you have even more anxious thoughts?On the one hand, I relax too much in the sense that I spend a lot of the day desperately seeking distractions such as comedy videos, and on the other hand, those activities are also frequently interrupted by intrusive thoughts and mental compulsions. I can't sit around daydreaming because intrusive thoughts bother me more then, so I seek distractions, but the distractions are themselves of a leisurely nature when I'm not at work. So do my distractions represent having trouble relaxing, or are they themselves examples of relaxing?
