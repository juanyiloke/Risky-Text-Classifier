Anxiety and worry about my jobHello,I am looking for some advice as I feel very down and stressed recently regarding my job circumstances.In January I was made redundant from a job that I loved and wanted to be doing for a long time, it was only a call centre job but I felt as though I really belonged there and always looked forward to going into work and never felt down or worried. After the redundancy I was worried about money so I took the first job offer that came about, I have worked at this new job now for 2 months and although I don't mind it and have made some friends, it is not what I want to being in the long run and I have been working very unsociable hours mainly late nights which has put a lot of strain on my personal life and is leaving me feeling exhausted most days. I have an interview tomorrow for a admin 9-5 job which is what I want to get back into and I have a good feeling that they may offer me the job. However I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night with worry and guilt that I would somehow have to tell my current job that I am going to leave when they have put so much effort into training me and trying to make me feel part of their team.I have suffered with bad anxiety for a long time but since the redundancy it has got a lot worse which is causing a lot of tears and sleepless nights.Is there any advice you can give me regarding speaking to my current manager about leaving, if it comes to it? as I am very nervous to do so and don't want to let anyone down.
