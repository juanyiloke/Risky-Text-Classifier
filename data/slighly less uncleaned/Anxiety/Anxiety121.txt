Is it anxiety or heart related ? Ê16    So it's been a couple of weeks since I felt stressed (up to my neck ) but it's been 2-3   that it escalated to actual physical pain! 2     my pulse was sky rocketing and so was my blood pressure so I rushed to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. Before I went to the ER I had some mild chest and arm discomfort and a chocking feeling which I still have. The doctors at the ER did an EKG and they said it was perfectly normal and they told me it was just stress .My doctor gave me some beta-blockers to help with my pulse rate , but I can't get rid of the discomfort and the extreme anxiety feeling , please , what do you thing it is heart or stress related?
