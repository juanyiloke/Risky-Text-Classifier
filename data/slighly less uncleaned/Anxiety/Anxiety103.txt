how is this for social anxiety drug regimen ? Ê10    Tofisopam - Atypical benzo that supposedly doesnt cause impairment or addictio as benzos (taken twice daily each 50 mg)-Paroxetine - Taken daily hoping it would work in 3 week or 4 weeks time-Inderal - For perfomance anxiety and physical anxiety symptoms (taken 3 times daily 10 mg each )-Lyrica - I tried it before at 75 mgs but it stopped working i guess 150 mg is minimum otherwise its sugar pill so i will try it 150 mgs then titrate-Mirapex - This one hasn't been prescriped for me yet but from my knowledge if dopamine increases in brain the anxiety gets low so a dopaminergic agent as mirapex should work.Last but not least-Valium - use 2.5-5 mgs only when extremly needed to avoid dependance and withdrawalSo what do you think of this regimen for social anxiety ? About every drug of those (you can ignore tofisopam since its only in europe if u dont know it) and do you suggest anything else
