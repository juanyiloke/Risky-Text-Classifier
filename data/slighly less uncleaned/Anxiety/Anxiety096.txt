Xanax withdrawals and depression Ê9    Ok. So I've been taking xanax 0.5, few nights 1 mg to help me sleep, because I was stupid I guess, now I am trying to quit. Went cold turkey and I think It's my 5th day. I didn't have some really scary symptoms till now. My heart beats faster I think, everything is speedin up, but I am not giving up, I am going all the way to the end. Can't really sleep properly, which is frustrating. First when I started with them I was too tired from my job and the night shifts, and I was worried a lot. So I went there and complained , if I go back now I wouldn't take this drug, everything was going to pass , it just needs time. But only because I had bad sleep few nights in a row I panicked, and took them. they did help with the sleep the first few   then just stop working and making everything worse, now I have to wait everything to get back in normal. So I have question to some survivors. In my opinion 4-5 months is probably not too much and the dose was not so much 0.5mg at night, sometimes 1mg at night. should I expect something bad to happen, or just keep rolling, it's my fifth day. and how long till everything comes back to normal and the worst thing, how long does it take for my insomnia to go away.. I feel like I am not panicking now my mood is ok , mentally stable, there is no reason waking up every hour then having trouble to fall asleep, it's probably the xanax, that messed up the chemistry in my brain. I went to the doctor he told me to quit and prescibed me celexa. but no, I am not going down to another road now. I want to get clean of those things
