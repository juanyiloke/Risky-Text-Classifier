anxiety about not being appreciated?So, I realize that not being appreciated is something that many people worry about, but since I have really bad anxiety (which is currently manifesting as relationship anxiety) I tend to get even worse about it. I think I take little occurrences and blow them out of proportion, such as when I feel my boyfriend doesn't get as excited about things as I do, even if he is happy. Sometimes I feel like I read too far into things like that and tell myself things like:"He doesn't care about what you did.""He won't appreciate that. He'll think its stupid."But the thing is, I can't tangibly think of any reason that those thoughts are valid.ÊDoes anyone have a good way to sift through thoughts and determine if they are legitimate or not? I also need advice on not being so catastrophic in my thinking. Help please!Please & thank you!
