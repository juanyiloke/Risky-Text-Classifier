Went Off Prozac Too Scared To Try Something ElseI was on prozac for about a week but then I had one day where all I felt was panic. I couldn't calm down and I couldn't shut my brain off. It felt like I was going crazy. I didn't think I could put up with that for 4 more weeks until things "kicked in" so I stopped the meds. I went back to my doctor but she keeps insisting I'm depressed. I fear death but I do not want to die, I am in no way suicidal. I have intrusive thoughts, I am constantly anxious, I can't sleep or at least when I do it's not a very restful sleep. I am constantly jumpy and on edge. I don't feel hopeless (well I feel hopeless in the way that this feels like it will never stop) but I have plans for the future, I WANT to get better, I fear that I never will but I also have a feeling of knowing there must be some kind of solution. I'm not sure what to do. I can't get in with my psychiatrist (she's not returning my calls no matter how much I call) and my GP keeps telling me to see a psychiatrist. To find a new one I'd have to wait 2 months and I don't think I can wait two months. Is it just a better idea to committ myself to a hospital so they can take care of me? Because otherwise I'm alone ALL day with no one to talk to. I have a roommate but he works and so he's only here at night. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? I hate hospitals, HATE them, but I'm starting to think this is the only option that I have, self committal.
