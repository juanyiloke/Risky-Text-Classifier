I am afraid that my acceptance to JMU might be revokedSo throughout high school I have done pretty well academically, mostly a and b student. I found out last month that I got accepted into JMU. My dream college. So I am really excited, but I just checked online and in honors human and anatomy I have a c- right now and we are already half way trough the quarter. It's because I completely bombed the nervous system test and I have a 0 for a lab grade tha I didn't finish. She said I could finish it next class but she wasn't here the next class so I will finish it on Monday so that will bring it up somewhat. The 2 upcoming grades I have are a project and the peripheral nervous system and Central nervous system test. Also a project for creating a children's book on the lymphatic system. I want to do really good on that, but I can't draw so who knows how well that will turn out. I am going to start studying for the test weekend and I am going to study my butt off, but I am so scared that I Might fail it.Ê Her tests are so hard and I got a b last quarter so if I get a D I am afraid JMU might unaccept me. My final grade would still be a c or c-, but I am still really afraid. What are the chances that I might be unaccepted I am really terrified. Do final transcripts show quarter grades? I am really really freaking out.
