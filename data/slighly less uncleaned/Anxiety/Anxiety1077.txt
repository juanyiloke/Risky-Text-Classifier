Trying not to ruin everything...I'll start off with saying that I have had anxiety since I was little, it actually became a major part of my life after my dad died when I was young. After he did the anxiety has been going on since then and it progressively getting worse. I am 20 now, in college and in a healthy relationship with someone for the past six months. My anxiety has been progressing lately with the stress of finally being an adult and having to face life. My home life has always been difficult and never peaceful, as I'm getting older it's getting to the point where I need to find a decent job and move out because I am not wanted here.ÊIt's just all getting to the point where my anxiety is running into my relationship now and I am so paranoid and think of everything wrong. It's almost as if my anxiety picks something and fixates on it to drive me crazy. Lately I have been having non stop nightmares of my boy friend cheating on me and after these nightmares that is all I would think about all day. I'm slowly getting off that fixation, but every little thing is getting so dramatic in my life. I possibly may not be able to see him this weekend and that is setting me off. Anything about him or anything about my life in general drives me into an anxiety frenzy. I am getting to the point where I do not want to eat, I cannot even sleep properly, and my nightmares consume me.I finally concluded that I have GAD due to my psychology class and what I learned about it. I stress over things all day that shouldn't be stressed over... I've been on medications before, but they always made me more suicidal or upset... I cannot afford therapy as my insurance is running out.... I'm basically looking for suggestions on how to handle all of this and how to not let it ruin my life as well as my relationship... That is really my biggest fear that it is going to ruin this relationship and my college career at this point....
