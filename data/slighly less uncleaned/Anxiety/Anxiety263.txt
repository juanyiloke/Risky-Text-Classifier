MomsDo you feel like your anxiety/panic attacks get in the way of being a mom? I'm so afraid of letting my baby down because my fear of everything right now. I know things will get better once I'm on my meds but with an anxious mind now, I question if I can be a good mom. It scares me. I want to be the best mom I can be but my anxiety just makes me ask myself what if. Im also a single mom so all the pressure is on me.
