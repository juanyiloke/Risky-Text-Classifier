TalkingIn real life and to people on the net.ÊI'm perfectly happy to do my own thing in every other way but when it comes to interacting with people, nothing. I typed out 5-6 replies to peoples threads today to try and help, but deleted them and started doing something else. I know what I wanted to say and the context of what was being said but my mind went wtf are you doing? Your only going to have to explain what you just said anyway. A couple of sentences is going to turn into a 2 page essay, is it really worth contributing something? In real life its even worse. Always end up blurting out the equivalent of a riddle.Not much of a talker tbh, more of an observer. Can crack a joke and be an idiot but those small number of times when I actually want to say something, nothing.Is it just a matter of keep talking to people till it gets better?
