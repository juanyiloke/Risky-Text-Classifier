worried after i hit myself on the head with a golf ballas much as this is funny im actually worrying because around 9 hours ago i was at a golf driving range and hit the ball wrong (im not very good) and it hit the roof above me and hit me on the top of the head, it hasnt bumped and i didnt lose consciousness or anything like that but now i have a mild headache(even though i had abit of a headache this morning from being tired however now im worrying im going to die, i tried to see sense and tell myself that i didnt hit with proper contact and it hit the roof which must of took alot of the power out of it and for it not have even cut me or bumped it cant of been that hard, i just feel really weird which i hope is due to the anxiety as im always paranoid about dying, thanks in advance if you can share your opinion
