GAD with floexetine and propranolol Ê11    Hi all. New to this forum but needed some familiar advice. I have been suffering from GAD since 2009 . Turns out I worry about everything enough to have panic attacks. Prescribed 80mg of propranolol daily which worked but convinced myself I was becoming immune to it after many years. Now my doctor has also put me on 20mg of floexetine daily to help settle my way of thinking. Been on them a week and already feel a bit zoned out and tired. Could this be the anti depressant or the worry that I'm taking a new pill that's causing it. I'm thinking its a bit a of both. Im normally very focused and active but have stayedbin the past week on the sofa. Heart palpitations and spaced out feeling have kept me here.Any thoughts?Jason
