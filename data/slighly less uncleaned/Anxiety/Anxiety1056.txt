Anxiety all the time please helpI have constant anxiety. I've been through so many medications and nothin b works but benzoyl and I'm afraid I have become dependent on them. My mind automatically starts negative in the morning and then it just starts snowballing. I got fired from my job because of it. My husband is military and he thought it was for the best for me to come home and stay with my mom. My mom isn't much better than I am. So I sit in the house all day with the anxiety until I can't stand it anymore and take the benzos. I try self talk and breathing but it's just so hard. I want to go out and live my life again but my anxiety gets so bad it scares me to death to do anything. Then all I have is to stay at home all day and do nothing but sit with my thoughts. I feel so trapped and I don't feel like I can get out of it.
