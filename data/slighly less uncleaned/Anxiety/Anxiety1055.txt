AM i going koko !!!!Ok so i think i am pretty social person when the need arise i can deal with people put on a good show and i good joke i had pretty good presentation skills and i could talk with people i didn't know very easily.it was actually part of my last position that i had to present for for people 3 times i week or so and i delivered sessions also both technical and non-technical beforeevery thing sounds good and all but here's where things get rather weird i couple of weeks before we had a business pitch which was kinda important and i was given the job of actually pitching it and i utterly ###$ it up (its alright it happens to every one sometimes we are only human ) and i though that it was behind me not problemsbut today we had like a company meeting (about 60 people or so) and i was asked for my input on a subject(company culture and what not) and just when i was going to answer i had something that feels suspiciously like a panic attack it felt like my vision was going into tunnel vision i head was like it was being pulled from all sides and my stomach cramped and i barley said part of the input and when i sat down i felt heavy like i just ran a marathonand then i begin thinking and i found my self that in the last couple of weeks i didn't get out of the house except for work and i felt out of place in the last social gathering going to the corners of the room (i never did that before) not to mention that i have been mood swings feeling down for no reasoni am really really really sacred my lively hood actually centers around managing and speaking to people while pitching ideas and delivering relevant sessions to the different teams and i work with strangers 90% of the time and know i have to put effort to even speak to a little crowd.p.s.i used to feel anxiety when i had a big game when i was little (i trained in karate *black belt*) and it was the cause of more than one defeatPlease Help me if you can!!!
