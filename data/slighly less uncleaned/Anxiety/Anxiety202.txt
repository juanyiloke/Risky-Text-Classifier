Worried I have colon cancerIn November I began having constipation problems, as well as thin stools. During the preceding two or such weeks before this I had nausea and got sick whenever I tried to eat much, as well as insomnia, which seems odd to be associated with this problem. But for the last five months I have irregular bowel movements, and it's getting a little worrying. I also have an occasional loss of appetite. The only positives are no blood, no pain, fatigue or weight loss so far. I have been to the doctor about this and they try to attribute it all to fiber. They also found a lot of stool lodged in my colon during an x-ray. I want them to give me a scope, but they feel it's unneeded. I am 23, slim, eat too much meat and too little vegetables then I should, have bowel problems on my mom's side and an unknown history on my biological father's side of the family. Due to my age colon cancer would be very unlikely, but not impossible. I'd like some insight on what you all think of my situation. I also have two small lumps under my right armpit. They're lightly red tinted. One appeared on Monday and another two days ago. The one from Monday has gotten smaller. It also used to leak a pus like fluid.
