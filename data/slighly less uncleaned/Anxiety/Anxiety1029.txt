Anxiety causing spitting while talkingI'm 32 years old and work in an office job that requires me to constantly talk with people face-to-face in meetings.Over the past 12-24 months, I've developed a speech impediment whereby I spit while talking. Almost without fail, everyone I speak to starts wiping their face while I talk. Its incredibly embarrassing and I feel horrible. It makes me think twice before speaking up in a meeting and its really affecting my job and professional relationships.It happens whenever I speak to someone who is closer than 2-3 meters from me. If they are 3+ metres away I feel more confident and I speak more normally.This also happens with my close friends. The only people who I don't spit on while talking are my absolute closest family members (wife, daughter, mum, brother). Everyone else cops it.I've done the typical google searches and people say to slow down your speech etc. However, I've tried everything from speaking slowly and speaking quickly, loudly and softly. Nothing works.This has started happening at a point in my life where I actually know what I'm talking about at work. I've got a good 12 years experience in the industry. However, this impediment is really holding me back.ÊIt seems to be a vicious cycle of spitting while I talk, so I talk softer and appear less confident. Feeling less confident makes me struggle to speak properly.Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?
