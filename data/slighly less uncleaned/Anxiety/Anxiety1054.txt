I don't know what to do anymore *long post*First of all I'm way to young for this everything you heat people my age always have to be happy and it's like a sin to be in pain in anyway or it'll just make people lose faith in this generation. I'm also scared this will make me a messed up adult. Well I'm having anxiety basically about other problems in my life like ocd and my social awkwardness that I got from a thing in 6th grade. I also have this thing from a long time ago that i did and nobody ever talks about it and it happened so long ago I'm not sure really what happenee but I can't talk to the people who I know we're there because if it was an okay topic to talk about we would already have. then finally I havevthis wired fear sometimes that I really can't explain or helped that's really annoying. Okay. Remember the thing I said about being to young well if I were to get help i would had to talk to my mom then If I really really thought I need therpy I would have to tell her everything witch I desperately don't want to do. Then if I got therpy my brother and sister would wonder where I go and I would be on some type if persctiption. I'm always seeing things about how sad it is to see a a person like me so that. I really am not sure what I should do please help or any advice I really feel alone
