having a relationship ?hi just want to ask if anyone has difficulty in having a relationship because of their anxiety as ive been single now for 10yrs and ive got a male friend whome ive known for 8yrs and for the past couple of yrs we have got a lot closer but , we dont see each other very often as I always make exuses up not to see him because i feel anxiouse all the time and scared incase he see"s me like it and he will reject me or he will feel he couldn't handle being with someone who suffers with a mental disorder,he does know i suffer with anxiety but has never seen me when im in really bad, i don't know if its the anxiety talking but i think to myself that maybe forget about having relationship with some one as it wouldnt be fair on them being with with someone like me and just be on my own.so just wonderd if anyone else has ever thought this way thk u
