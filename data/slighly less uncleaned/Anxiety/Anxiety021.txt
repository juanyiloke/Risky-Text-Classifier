I am seriously thinking about establishing a monthly meet up in London .I know I am very new to this site and the Anxiety Discussion Forum , but I myself and not knew to living with Anxiety and Depression and have always been known to be active in bringing people together to talk and exchange ideas about coping with lifes issues.I am looking at a way to see how it could work and what interest is out here for those who feel that meeting up with others in a safe environment could be a beneficial factor to be able to discuss relevant needs and issues in a collective group.I know that this is also what this site does but for me often I feel there is something to be said when people come together in the physical sense and share thier lives and coping mechanisms in keeping the anxiety at bay.I have been told a multitude of times I have great leadership qualities and a lot of compassion for others and I wonder how I can make use of these skills.I have aboundant organisational skills too and strongly believe it is people who need people , and when people come together there can be something great happening in individual lives to bring change and better understanding of what we are all dealing with.I just wonder where I could go with all these thoughts and ideas right now and what other peoples resonse to setting up a monthly meet in London for starters.This could be something to look at in the coming months.Your response would be appreciated to get me thinking towards the concept and idea.Possible often ask a visiting speaker to come and talk to the group as well.PJ
