Really struggling with coping with anxiety and panic attacks.I have been off work for two weeks and a bit and am really struggling my down periods. I have been to the GP and treatment is on going.I have suffered with anxiety before but this is something on a whole other level.I get to the point where i am unable to do anything, i feel like i cant move! It is awful.I get terrible shakes, feel like i cant swallow food but i am extremely hungry, my heart races and i got hot prickly feelings in my arms. Along with that horrible wooshy feeling in my stomach.Some   i suddenly feel i am better then boom another day its back! Whether there is a reason for it or not. I have been signed off a further 4 weeks and am waiting on test results as i have been ill since October with Glandular fever and breathing problems.After 4 weeks off with that in March i then went back to work and moved out for the first time at the age of 25 with my boyfriend. We have lived together previously so i know it isnt anything to do with him. The only thought is i did far too much too soon after being so poorly for so long.Anyway, i just feel when i am having a bad day i cannot cope and cannot imagine carrying on day after day if i feel this way.Any advice or own experiebces would be helpful so i know that i can get over this and get back to life again one day. Sorry it is a long one!Leanne.
