I'm really scared I have cancer!Hi all,I've   in here a couple of times not so long  . I thought I had my anxiety under control after 11 weeks of taking fluoxetine....But couple of weeks   I found a lump in my throat (actually inside near my tonsil)I've been to see a private doctor about it and she's refered me to see a consultant.Other than this I've had so many other symptoms - I feel deaf in both my ears, I'm extremely tired ALL the time no matter how much sleep I have, I get chest pains, my stomach is bloated, I feel weak and the list goes on!Does anyone else experience this? I'm so adamant that I have cancer and it's spreading slowly all over my body!The doctor did say that it is very likely to be reacuring viral infections and that it's very unlikely to be cancer because of my age (23).I know anxiety can cause alsorts of symptoms and also make you believe you have serious illnesses. Does any one else worry the same as me?
