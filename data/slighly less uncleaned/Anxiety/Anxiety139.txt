Just because she's a sufferer,she doesn't see mine? Ê12    I've suffered badly with anxiety for around 8-ish months now,I'd been anxious before but it was nothing on this scale. During this time,my best friend has also been to see doctors and they've come to the conclusion that she also suffers with it,which I obviously understood and felt horrendous for her as I know what she's going through. However,I didn't tell her about mine until after she'd been diagnosed,and she gets panic attacks much more often than I do,and hers is a lot more evident. When i feel anxious,I try and keep it quiet because I hate attention being drawn to me. But because this happens, I feel like she thinks I'm messing around and that just because my anxiety and worries aren't the same as hers,that they don't matter,almost like she thinks I'm doing it FOR attention,to 'go with the trend'! How Can I get her to realize that just because it's not evident,it is there?
