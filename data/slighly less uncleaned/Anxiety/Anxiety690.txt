AdviceHi everyone,I wonder if anyone can help me out. I have suffered with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) since I was assaulted in the street in an unprovoked attack some years ago. I take an anti-depressant drug and at the moment my GAD is (sort of) better than it was.However, for the last year or so I have been having intrusive thoughts. I have these thoughts very frequently, but they are more intense and more prevalent in certain situations. For instance, when I am in a car on a Motorway these days (I don't drive but my brother does), I begin to think "What if I open the car door and throw myself onto the Motorway?" and I become almost convinced that I am actually going to do that. I then have a full blown panic attack that seems never ending. I now completely avoid motorways. Also, if I stay in a hotel room that is a few floors up, I become terrified, literally terrified, that I might throw myself out of the hotel window.ÊI am due to begin cognitive therapy next month, but before then I have to attend the funeral of my uncle in a completely different part of the country. It will involve a very long car journey and several hours of Motorway travel. It will also entail an overnight stay in a high rise hotel. What can I do? I would be so grateful for any suggestions.Thank you.
