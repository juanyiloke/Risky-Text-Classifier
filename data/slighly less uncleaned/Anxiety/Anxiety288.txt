Danger: Schizophrenia and PTSDYesterday I found out that my boyfriend was diagnosed with Schizophrenia (years back). When we first met, I never asked him what he was getting SSI for because he has tremors and shakes sometimes. I thought that was it, until he displayed signs of weird acts.I haven't even looked up the symptoms but I'm sure he falls into every single one. I think he may be in serious denial because he said he only "acted that way" and they took him seriously at the mental health hospital. He also said scans were taken, neurological. I don't know what to believe.My psychiatrist has told me to watch for red flags, and signs. I have PTSD along with ..anxiety/depression. My question is just, has anyone here been in a relationship with someone who is Schizphrenic? I want this to work with him but we've had some serious drama. His ex has told me he hit her, and he never denied it.
