I have fear of fainting and being dizzy   Here is my story. Two months ago I was taking to the hospital because every time I bent down I was getting extremely dizzy. The dog told that I was extremely dehydrated and exhausted. I got two intravenous food and sent home.I felt much better.  About a week after that I felt the exact way as if I was going to pass out, with the exception that this time was anxiety. I say that because when I parked my car in the same spot as I did two weeks prior, it brought back bad memories of feeling dizzy. My anxiety had gotten out of control and I started seeing a therapist.  I have my good days and bad days. This past Thursday it happened again. I was at work and I bent down to get something and I almost passed out.  Again the doctor said I was dehydrated.I  am 50 years old and getting extreme hot flushes,  so I perspire a lot. I know logically I have to drink plenty of fluids to keep my self from feeling faint. My problem is that I cant shake my anxiety and fear of fainting. If anyone is going through the same thing as me, please help me. My doctor has found absolutely nothing wrong with me. I don't want my anxiety to take over my life, and I feel that I  traveling In that direction. PLEASE ANY AVIS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.
