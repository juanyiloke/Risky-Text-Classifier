Hi all! - Which catagory would I fit into?Can't remember when I last posted (many moons ago)... and was happy that I seemed to be over my morning anxiety...For awhile everything seemed 'ok'...but for about the past month something new has cropped up. Am wondering if any of you can relate to this. Also, would welcome suggestions as to which category you think I would 'fit into.' Thanks!Ê ÊThis problem gets worse off and on. When I first wake up in the mornings, I am 'ok'...but within a few minutes I start getting this terrible morbid feeling...like its dark gray...Somewhat like what you might feel in a strange, weird nightmare. I am not nervous...or really depressed... this is just a miserably heavy-lead like feeling. Oh my, for just a whiff of feeling 'normal' sometimes.I force myself to get up and go through my usual routine (even though its hard get out of bed, but staying IN bed does NOT help)... Sometimes this feeling lasts 3 to 5 hours then it goes away. The last couple of days, it just keeps lingering on. I am not on meds (allergic to most SSRIs..) I am a senior and retired and I know that being without a routine has NOT been good for me. Can anybody out there relate? I'd appreciate hearing from any of you.
