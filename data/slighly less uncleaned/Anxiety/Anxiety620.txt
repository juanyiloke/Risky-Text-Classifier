Really suffering tonightHi everyone,Well, I have had a ghastly time of it lately... relationship traumas, family conflict, appalling stress generally. I would write a novel if I tried to put it all down here, but suffice it to say I really have been in the wars.ÊTonight I feel terrible - very low in mood, very sad, and also distressed because I am presently a little estranged from my mother, who is away with my sister and not coming back for another three weeks. I had an upsetting call with her earlier - I mentioned how bad I am feeling - I have terrible insomnia and IBS at the moment - and she told me I am too clingy and dependent, and that I should grow up. I am really smarting from this, I have tears pricking at my eyes all the time. She said I needed to start being an adult and stop going on about my problems.ÊThe fact is that I am actually in an awful state, having been severely traumatised by a relationship with someone mentally disordered - and while I do accept that my mum can't wave a magic wand and take all my pain away, the fact is that when she withdraws her support and says things like that it really undermines my confidence and my self-esteem. I hate feeling a burden, but I don't know who to turn to. I have tried to tell the doctor how bad I feel, but the general message seems to be just 'Soldier on'. I have been given antidepressants, but they don't help me with my trauma at all, that's something I just have to find a way of processing in my own time.ÊAnyway... I am hoping that, as time passes, things will move on and the 'wheel will roll around', but right now I am in a bad place with everything. I just wanted to say hi to everyone, really xx
