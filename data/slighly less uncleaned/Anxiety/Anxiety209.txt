No reason for my anxietyI've had anxiety and anxiety attacks almost for the past year. At the beginning, they were brought on by thinking too much about death and different types of sicknesses. I've settled down in my thoughts and don't even think too much about these things anymore. However, randomly I'll feel all this anxiety welling up in me and I'll start having scary thoughts and start over thinking things and wonder if I'll like forget to breathe or perform some other vital bodily needed to survive. It's weird how it just seems to come out of nowhere, I used to have to work myself into it by being in certain situations or thinking about a difficult topic. Nowadays, it feels just like any other kind of ailment that just suddenly and randomly causes me discomfort and eventually fades.ÊI'm wondering if its just that my brain is so used to throwing on that anxiety switch, that I'm still dealing with repercussions even in non-anxiety producing situations. I even feel like I've worked out all the underlying issues that were causing the anxiety, but random flare ups of anxiety persist.Maybe it will just take time as my brain adjusts to not having to use the anxious part all the time, and the anxiety response will slowly become less habitual.
