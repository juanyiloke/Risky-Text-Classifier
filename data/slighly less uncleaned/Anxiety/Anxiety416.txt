Prozac Start Up Insomnia?Prozac was making me a bit too sick. I was on 10mgs for 6 days, then I stopped for two, then went back on it at 5mgs for a week. I was doing relatively fine then I was told to up the dose to 10mgs again for another week (or two, might be two I can't remember have to call my doctor tomorrow) I've been on 10mgs a night for two nights now and I haven't been able to sleep even with the help of valium. All that really does it make me really groggy but I can't sleep. Though the prozac is also really REALLY upsetting my stomach (or I assume it's the prozac doing that) which makes it hard to sleep. I've been on this stuff for what seems like a while now, should I still be having effects like this? I know the starting dosage was really low (5mgs) and there was a bit of an upset stomach with it but not like this. I assume this is normal when stepping up this medication? I also feel kind of zombie like, slow, very tired/fatigued which I also know are all side effects of starting up the medication. Some people said that they felt this way for over a month before becoming "normal". I'm just wondering if this is all normal or if it's best to check with my doctor about it. I don't want to seem like a whiner to them but if these things are preventing me from sleeping or eating properly it's probably best to ask at least someone right?
