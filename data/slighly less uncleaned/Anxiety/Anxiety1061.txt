Social phobia, agoraphobia or something elseI have had mild cases of anxiety all of 2014. A panic attack once every 3-6 months until November. It's been getting worse almost everyday. My dr prescribed .5 mg of the generic kolonopin. I only took it when i needed it until November. I began taking it 2-3 times a day because anxiety hit when I realized I have to leave the house. I still go to work everyday (I'm scheduled) I still go to the store and I can go to movies by myself and with friends. I can go out to eat. I dont go to clubs or bars though. (Too many people in an uncomfortable atmosphere) I go to all my dr appts. I am able to do all of that but it triggers my anxiety once I'm leaving the house. I get further down the road and it hits me harder with nausea. I took 2 pills when I woke so it's already in my system. No need to take more. I get to work. Still anxious and nauseous. The longer I'm at work, the worse it gets. I end up taking 2 more pills so I don't have a panic attack at work. The point is, the longer I'm out, the worse it gets. No matter where I go. The pills don't help. I told my dr and he bumped it to 1 mg but he said if this doesn't work, he's not giving me anything else. I try to force out a panic attack in hopes the anxiety will go away, but the only time that works is when I'm in the shower. (Weird, right?) I have a full on panic attack. Hyperventilating and all. I still have the anxiety though. I'm only fine when I realize I don't have to leave the house, but naturally, that doesn't last long
