Scared of getting old wasting timeHello not sure where to post this I usually post in OCD thread because I suffer from that the most but I suffer from anxiety over everything so thought this topic could go here.. Well just turned 28 this year and my age is making me real scared because 30 is just around the corner and I feel I'm getting old and it's making me depressed not the number it's self but my life has gone nowhere.. I look back at my 20s and feel I wasted my life.. From 19-24 my life was about art school and because of my social anxiety ocd it was very hard I did well in school but social life and business life was zero.. Zero friends, zero girlfriends, to scared to find a real job because of my confidence in myself so for the next few years I wastes my time at crappy minimum wage jobs just gettin by.. But deep inside I was still following my dreams.. When I turned 27 I went through some bad trauma that caused me to get OCD super severe, followed by a downward spiral of fear, depression that turned my world upside down so from 27-28 was a battle of OCD.. Now I'm 28 and my life just feels so messed up because of anxiety ocd and bipolar.. when I look at my 20s in retrospect I feel what a waste.. now that I have PTSD after an event when I turned 27 it's made life a million times harder.. Just so aggravated and depressed.. I look around my friends my age have careers, married, buying homes, having babies.. And me.. Crap job.. Little apoartment.. Poor, alone, scared..  all my goals dreams that I know I want are all just in a fog covered with anxiety.. And I feel like I'm runing out of time getting old to fix any of it... I don't really need life direction advice but if you can relate to the pain of feeling like you went through the feelings of wasting time or gettin old please share
