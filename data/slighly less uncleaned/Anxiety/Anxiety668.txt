Not sleeping again:(Oh I'm so fed up. I haven't slept for 2 nights. Well I did have around 2 hours last night but that's it. Was doing so well last week, one night I slept 7 hours! It's like now my brain has just forgotten how to sleep! The trazodone (50mg) seems to have stopped working.ÊCan someone reassure me that this will get better? I know I've posted about my insomnia before but need a bit of help again!
