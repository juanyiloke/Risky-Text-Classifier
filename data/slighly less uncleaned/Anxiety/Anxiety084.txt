Stopped Prozac after 9   Ê8    Hi, following on from and old thread, my doctor prescribed me with 20 mg daily of floexetine on top off my normal 80mg of propranolol. I started last Friday. Since then last week was absolute hell!! I didnt know who I was and lost motivation and appetite. Also got more anxious and sweaty. Then cried like a baby twice. I rang the out of hours doctor and explained that my general anxiety had heightened and made me not myself. He suggested I miss a dose and take a does then consult my doctorn in person. I stopped taking the floexetine on Saturday morning. Missed Sunday and now im missing today too. Doctors 1st thing tmrw. What concerns me is.........have I over thought taking a new pill which in turn has made me panic or has the floexetine contributed and messed with my feelings. I feel I can't think straight now and scared. Can you come off them after 9 doses?Can anyone help.Jason
