Do Most People With Anxiety Disorders Have These Feelings?The conflicting feelings of being the unwanted center of attention one minute with everyone staring at and judging you, and feeling as though they are completely ignoring the fact that you exist the next? I’ve noticed this is a common issue with people discussing anxiety disorders and have experienced it before myself. I used to think everyone out on the street was whispering and talking about me and my appearance, it took years for me to accept that it was all in my head, same was the case with the being ignored and treated as though I didn’t exist when people didn’t want/need anything from me.
