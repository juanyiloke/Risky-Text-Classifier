ÊScrambled Thoughts When LearningHi!I don't know if this should have been in the social anxiety section or this one as I suffer with both. Anyway, I am at college at the moment and finding it extremely difficult to take in what I'm trying to learn.I listen, I try to concentrate (and think I am) and try and engage as best as possible but it's making me feel stupid or something cause it just won't go in. Well some of it will, but very slowly. Is this anxiety related?What do you do about it if it is. Just except that there's no point, cause now I haven't much time left before I have to complete some exams and think I'm going to fail.Has anyone else had this?
