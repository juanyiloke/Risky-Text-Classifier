need some thoughts please :(I am a 23 year old female with alot of anxiety. My anxiety causes me pains all throughout my body, the newest one being in my left armpit. I started a new job in March, where i am required to hang tags and signs throughout the store, and being only 5 feet tall i have to really reach to the top shelfs. Also sometimes pulling the old tag off the shelf to replace with a new one can require alot of force sometimes. i've tried to stay off the internet, as i know web md is a horrible website in general, and even more so in people who have anxiety. Ive felt around my armpit for lumps, and ive found nothing. i find that when i am not thinking about it, i dont notice the pain, meaning its most likely all just in my head. it doesnt disturb my sleep, and the pain isnt like a "oh my god i cant move". it's just kind of there, like a dull ache, with the occasional stabbing sensation. I know anxiety causes alot of physical symptoms, and when i really get myself going thinking its something more serious, thats when the pain seems to get worse.
