help! Ê14    Hi.I am all new to this. Ive suffered from depression on and off for 11 years. Only from aug 2014 i had a bad miscarriage and needed to have an emergency op. Since then my depression has become worse to the point i think i have everything going i had to have an mri on my back and thought i had MS. Then i coughed up a small amount of blood due to coughing all the time i had an xray and that came back clear. I really thought i had lung cancer even though i dont smoke. Turns out i had probably burst a blood vessel from coughing. I have been diagnosed with health anxiety. And started suffering from panic attacks as well. I have been put on medication for my depression and panic attacks. Im worried that i will never get better. I just cant stop the worry. And like most i google everything. Please some one tell me it does get better?
