OCD meds for anxiety complicated by aspergers?posted this on aspergers, will probably post on delression too.Just for background, I have aspergers syndrome, anxiety and depression.I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the past ten years now, Ithink I'm seeing a therapist that has a a little bit of sense about him. He feels like I go in cycles a lot and always seem to talk about the same themes. When I have anxiety atttacks now, and I guess when I've always had them Iget hyperfocused and even when I know somethings illogical I get locked in a certain set of thinking that ends up biting me in the ass.ÊMy psychologisst wants me to be put on OCD medication for this. His logic is that asperges can have the obsessive part of OCD, but not the compulsion part usually. It makes sense to me, has anyone been put on OCD meds without a diagnosis of OCD?I'm skeptical of medications because I've been on both stratera, and cymbalta and both made my life much worse. Has anyone been put on ocd medications here? Did it help you?
