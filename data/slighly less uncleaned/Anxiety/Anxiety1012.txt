My story & help with dealingHello, I wasn't sure where to ask for help and then this forum came up, hope you could help me.I am 17 years old, senior in high school. Last year I lived abroad.. and that year changed my life forever.. I realized how brain washed I was by my country (Israel) , I am forced to practice a religion at school, at public and on holy days by the government. In school they have been teaching kids how Jews are hated in the world, why we should serve in the army which however is not a choice, you either serve or go to jail. It is Sunday morning here, a working day.. I didn't go to school because I am mad, I always hurt people and have no friends because they are all brain washed. You probably guessed I am a 'Jew', I hate Jews and Israeli people. When I told people what's "wrong with me", they called me a Nazi.. and then I told them that they are being brain washed, forced to practice a religion and have to serve in the army.. But then they came up with a bunch of reasons why we have to do that and that.I am exhausted, I had suicidal thoughts for more then two months. If I don't move to a different country soon I rather be dead. I have less than a year before I am taken to army service (for three years- crazy I know).. I have been told I am mentally sick. I posted this here because I really don't know what to do... I am just sitting at home all day, I didn't go outside for almost three days, it's hard to deal with it alone, would you help me out?Thanks in advance, again I apologize if I hurt someone.Have a good day.
