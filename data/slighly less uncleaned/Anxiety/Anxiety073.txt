Feeling the strongest case of anxiety I have ever had and I'm getting scared. Ê7    Hey forum,i I was just wondering if I could share what's been happening with me lately and see if any one has had anything similar?Over the last few nights I have had a weird problem while I'm trying to sleep. Heck I'm not even sure if I am sleeping during this most of the time. As I sleep or fall asleep or lay awake (again I'm really not sure what is happening to me) I start to feel an overwhelming sensation of tingling on my skin. It's kind of like a floaty feeling but incredibly uncomfortable. It is then followed by me struggling to get air. Often it would be me waking up gasping really loudly for air not really sure what is going on and the tingling would disappear. But then as I put my head back to the pillow it starts again.As I try to go back to sleep different things start happening to my body. I feel like I might faint in my sleep but I googled you cannot faint when you are lieing down so that gives me a little bit of comfort. I feel my self go into panic attacks and I just lay there. Trying to calm my self down at this point (again not sure if I'm a sleep or not) sometimes I doze off sometimes I am awake but I start to hear everything really loudly. Kind of deafening.. Such as birds or cars going past the street. I heard a motorcycle once and swore it was in my room.i don't understand it. I wake up so drained. Moody. Unhappy. Wanting to go back to sleep in the morning and just struggling to get a hold of this. I am 24 and suffered from anxiety over the last 2 years but the last couple of   have been pretty much unbearable and I guess I just want to know if I am ok.thank you to whoever reads this.Michael
