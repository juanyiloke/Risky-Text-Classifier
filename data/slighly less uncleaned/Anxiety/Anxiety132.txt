Throat mucous as an anxiety symptomH,i I have been on this forum before I suffer from Anxiety, especially anything to do with health. ÊI am seeing a councillor. ÊI have many medical problems the worst being IBS, quiet at the moment, Arthritis, have been in pain all summer, now due to see consultant next week. ÊMore recently have had trouble with bad throat and awful mucous at one 24/7. ÊI have been given omeprazole an anti acid. ÊReading on line yesterday I sawinformation saying that throat mucous can be caused be anxiety. ÊMy question is does anyone here suffer with it, what are your symptoms and how did you treat it. My Gp says it is probably silent reflux and I realise anxiety makes everything worse. Would love you hear from anyone affected by this. ÊThanks
