ÊI'm just after a little advice..So, hi.My mother has struggled with anxiety for years - but it's only recently that she took the step towards getting help for it, and was officially diagnosed as having GAD.We're in the UK, and she had 12 CBT sessions (I think that's as many as you can have on the NHS, I'm not sure). She recently finished the 'course' of treatment, and really I'm looking for ways that I can help support her. If I'm honest, I think she probably needed more CBT, as I think by the time the course came to a close they were really only beginning to get into the root of the anxiety.She says she wants to try putting what she learned into practise, so she's seeing how that goes for now.She had a bit of a step back at the weekend - there are a couple of things that really trigger her attacks, and three of them hit her at once in succession and she was in a bit of a state.ÊShe called me and we talked, and I think I calmed her down, but obviously it comes on in waves, and I suspect she's going to have a bit more stress coming her way, and I was wondering if there is any advice from people on what I can do to try and help her and to support her - in general, and when she's having a bad attack.I'm also a bit worried that if I don't do it 'right', I might be enabling her? I'm not sure - I don't really know where else to ask, so I'd be grateful for any advice, information or tips that people can offer me (and the rest of my family) so we can make sure we're doing all we can to support her as she moves forward.Thanks!
