Altered state-terrifies meI have been suffering from depersonalisation for a year after a particularly anxious time.The worse thing has been the existensial thoughts which have scared me so much-I am sure it is the thoughts that have kept me in such a strange state because the original cause of the anxiety has long gone.I am not sure how I will ever get over these thoughts and feelings. I feel as though my sense of self has just dissolved into the people of the world and I have became part of every one of them-with no separate identity of my own. Now when I go anywhere I look at all the people living their lives and think-any one of them could be me. I have no sense of my own little place in the world. Even though I can still remember my past it seems as though it belongs to someone else. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed about it that I have dreadful panic attacksIt seems to be almost a experience of enlightenment which I have read Buddhists strive for-but I take no pleasure from it-I don't want it but I don't know how I will ever be able to go back into my bubble now!Can anyone identify with me? I tried EFT therapy for a while but it was making my anxiety much worse so I have given it up now.I am able to function and I switch these thoughts off when I need to-but I am always aware that I have just put them on hold. I feel I need to deal with them as they are spoiling my life. I know our thoughts cannot hurt us but still-it is very uncomfortable to live like this-I feel like 'I' have gone forever. Can anyone identify?Thank you
