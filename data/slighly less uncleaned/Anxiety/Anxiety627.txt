What happened?Hi, I used to be a confident person who liked a good social get together. But now I panic and just want to stay at home. What happened? What went wrong? wish I knew. It started around 12 years ago and has gradually got worse started with health issues and developed in to worrying about everything.I was put on meds straight away without understanding what was happening. Only recently I have started to actually understand anxiety but wonder if it's too late, after 12 years is it ever going to get better? Feeling quite low at the minute and I suppose I am after some support and any relaxation techniques as it seems like a long time since I last relaxed.ÊThanks
