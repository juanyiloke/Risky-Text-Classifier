Anyone else get this?Does anyone else get irrationally worried at something even though you've been reassured multiple times that things will be okay?Earlier, I had an anxiety attack because I was meant to go for a regular trim at my hairdressers, but my OH was with me so he decided to have a look around the shops. I realised I wouldn't be able to message him to find out where he was because my battery on my phone was critically low. I ended up freaking out and thinking "What if he leaves me or I can't find him and can't get home?" The stupid thing is, I would have been able to get home, sure it would have taken time but I still would have been capable.At the time I was absolutely terrified, but looking back I feel so stupid, ridiculous and embarrassed. I feel like an idiot.Ê
