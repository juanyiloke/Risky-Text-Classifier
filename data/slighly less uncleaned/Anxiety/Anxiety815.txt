Worry,worry,worry...!I have general anxiety over household chores and stuff that needs doing in the garden,like grass cutting and digging borders.It is stuff needs doing but I worry that I haven't got the physical strength to do them and that they won't get done.I worry all the time about this stuff,I do manage to get the household chores done but I get tired cos the one thing I lack is a lot of physical strength and energy.I also have to get a quote for men to repair and replace the house windows and paint them external.I worry about when to get this done, how much they will charge and if they will do the job properly,I worry about getting ripped off!I worry cos I am alone and about being lonely,I worry about my cats and if they will be ill or I will lose them.I worry about being too old to move and look after myself and my home.I worry I will die I worry I will live.I just worry all the time.How do you all deal with this kind of anxiety,I don't seem to be able to switch it off,though it used to paralyse me the worry,it isn't as bad as it used to be but it is bad.Any advice gratefully received.Nikitax
