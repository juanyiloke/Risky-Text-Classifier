BreathingHi All,I think the main problem im getting to trigger off my Anxiety is the fact I dont breath Properly. I have been sitting here tonight and feeling fine then I realised I am not taking full breaths. I kind of hold it half way and not take another breath in fully. It feels then that my body is tensing then I start yawning trying to get the breath in and out. I have tried to take deep breaths in and out but then i go back to breathing like that again...Any Advice??
