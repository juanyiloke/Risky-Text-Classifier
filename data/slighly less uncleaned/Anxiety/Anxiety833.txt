Trying to stay positive...butHi everyone. I hate doing this. Its like dumping and I know just by being part of this forum, you've got your own problems, but my husband doesn't like hearing that I'm unhappy or anything is wrong in my life and I have no one else at all to talk to. I've recently moved to a new country..well..over 3 years ago, so I'm pretty much on my own apart from my "be happy" husband. My family are in Australia and I'm in UK so I get to see them once a year and to do that I have to stay employed. With my current job I've been in for 3 years, my boss doesn't care about the company and I'm seeing my job disappear bit by bit because of total mismanagement. Its impossible to find another full time job as well. I've tried to get my boss into action many times but he has a mental condition and just can't get his act together. I won't see my kids or my grandkids again the way things are going. My health has been going downhill since I've come to UK as well. I have fibromyalgia and always seem to be in pain with the moisture in the air. They say people are in charge of their own destiny. I know the importance of being positive but when everything you do to maintain positivity is slapped in the face its getting impossible to keep going. Coming to work this morning there was a driver over my side of the road. My only thought was I didn't really care because if I was killed, it would solve my problems. I'm not suicidal because I really want to see my new baby grandson. I just feel dead from the neck up. I feel trapped in my circumstances I can't change. Anyone got a magic wand???Ê
