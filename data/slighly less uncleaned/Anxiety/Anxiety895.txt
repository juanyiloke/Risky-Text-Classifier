Anxiety about anxiety medicationsHi there,I have been diagnosed with a severe general anxiety disorder. Today my doctor prescribed me 5 mg of escitalopram (Cipralex). I have already had a bad reaction to citalopram but that was 20 mg and I think the dosage was too high. Anyways, I don't know how you treat someone with anxiety that is afraid of pills!! I am so nervous to take these pills that I don't know if I can take them. I am terrified of side effects. As soon as I feel a tiny bit not like myself I start to freak out. Does anyone have any experience with either of these SSRI's for anxiety!? Any input is appreciated. Thanks!
