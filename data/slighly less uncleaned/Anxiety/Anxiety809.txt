ÊFailed relationships .Hi everyone,Recently I've been in relationships that did not serve me very well.Thing is, i get very upset and tormented after breakups. I feel weak and out of energy(physically/mentally), that getting out of bed is a battle per se, with all depression and muscle spasms, etc.I've been told I'm weak for not handling adversity as i should, which makes me feel awful and dejected.ÊRelationship has been ongoing for a year and half, and after it ended, i felt horrible and out of place. I just still can't take the decision to move on and forget everything as if something never happened, lest, I'm weak! ( honestly, i feel it inside ).Is it normal for a person with GAD to feel this way, or am I magnifying the situation and repressing my weakness, clinging to anxiety as a reason to react this way ??ÊThank you in advance
