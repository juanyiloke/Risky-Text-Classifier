Bad times again any advice ?So here we are again 4 in the morning can't sleep and worrying myself sick , I posted a couple of months ago when my partner had been taken into hospital she has heart problems and had to have flui drained  from her lungs I was hoping to at some point come back on and say things had got better but our lives never seem to run smoothly , her lungs cleared up for a while which was good but she became very anxious and depressed she used to be so bubbly and full of life but we have had one knock back after another , the new problem is her perods pretty much stopped a few months ago and were irregular before that so the doctor has booked her in for tests ultra sound and blood tests to check for c , it's been 10 days and I can't sleep or stop thinking of worst case scenarios never mind what she is going through , on top of her ill health over the years we have nearly lost our daughter to an overdose which affected us both very deeply, we have money problems because her benifits were stopped because we claimed the wrong benifits that's been ongoing for a year and could end up in court , and a family member was found drowned towards the end of last year , these are the biggest problems we've had , the advise I was hoping for is could all of this turmoil be the reason for her new symptoms she has back pain iregular periods bloating and tiredness which are symptoms of something bad but could it be anxiety and stress ,she should be in for the tests soon but as usual I'm driving myself insane thinking the worst 24 / 7 , she's a good woman thoughtful and selfless towards others and doesn't deserve any of the bad luck she's had ,any advice would be appreciated ,thanks for taking the time to read
