CITALOPRAM TIME TO CHANGE? Ê7    I have been on Citalopram 20mg for 6 weeks on Thursday. Initially they increased my anxiety levels in the mornings but that has stabilised and have had no other side effects.My OCD condition and intrusive thoughts has not changed.I am as anxious as before and the intrusive thoughts just as intense.The doctor said would review medication in a month last time i saw her andmy next appointment is Thursday. I have read on an NHS site that medications can take 12 weeks to improve OCD.Has anyone else been in a similar position? How long did Citalopram take to work or how long before medication was changed and if so to what or was dosage increased.Any input welcome. I am not sure what to say to GP??Also does increasing dosage of Citalopram cause potential side effects???
