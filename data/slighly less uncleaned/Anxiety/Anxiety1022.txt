Having a MeltdownSo I just had to leave work early because I can't keep it cool. It's never before bled into my work before but I am just feeling overwhelmed. I have been given an enormous amount of responsibility at work and then some chick was hired at a higher level than I for literally twice my pay. So in essence, she is being paid for the work that I am doing. I have asked for a promotion and a raise from our boss and she said to discuss it with this new chick. The new chick doesn't understand her f'n job so she wants to wait to make the decision, which really isn't hers to make. It is so completely unfair that I should do the job NOW for what is getting paid to do. I am angry and frustrated and started crying. Thank god no one witnessed. But I am a bloody mess, shaking and crying. WTF? In fact, I feel like I should have been given her job and pay.
