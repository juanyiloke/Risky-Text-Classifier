feelings that you're loosing your mind?So I have been posting and recently   a message on here when I was on verge of panic attacks or whatever. I just want to know if other people constantly feel like you are loosing your grip on reality? My anxiety is getting worse before id have a panic attacl and that would cause me to be anxious for maybe a day or so and then id be back to normal now I can't remember the last time I had a normal day, I feel like im loosing the plot that im going mad. Its gone from being paranoid that im having a heart attack/stroke the point that I think im loosing it, over analysing anything I do questioning movements and thoughts and putting everything down to I think im going mad. Im constantly anxious on edge its a horrible gut feeling. I was very ill with flu last week and was bed ridden for 3   I vouldnt eat due to sickness ive been ok for a week now but still cant eat I have no appetite the thought of food repulses me ive been having one snack a day since last monday over a week   when I had a meal, is this because of the anxiety does anyone know? I have recently been to the doctors and I have been put on citalopram but im only a few   in to taking them so that could be a while nefore it kicks in. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with thoughts?
