Sexual performance anxiety and psychological EDI'm not sure if I have come to the right place for posting this but am feeling extremely anxious and would appreciate any advice or relevant information which can be offered.So here goes:I had sex with my partner recently and lasted for around 25 minutes before I inexplicably could no longer penetrate. This hasn't happened before so I was mildly concerned. The issue occupied my mind for the rest of the day and when I tried to sleep with her the following day I barely sustained myself for more than 10 minutes. Since then my head has been heavy with anxious thoughts and the fear that I will never be able to have sex again is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore and easier to believe. I have been struggling to think about anything else.I would like to know if anyone on here experiences/has experienced anything similar and if so how long it lasted and if/how it can be cured.As a side-note I do have certain knowledge that this is a purely psychological condition;not physical.Thank you.
