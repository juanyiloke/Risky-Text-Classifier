now my mind is coming back i realize i'm not right!Sorry!! I'm new here and a little lost and hoping there are others who can shed light/understand (or help me understand) what is happening. I'll keep this short as i can...i have depression and anxiety, on sertaline 150mg, lorazpan 1mg and a sleeping tab at 7.5 think its zop????something. Had to live with parents for 2 months but realized a habit i have is getting worse, i often twiddle my hair and get my finger stuck so pull the hair out and find it's becoming a realise to do so. I also find myself picking at anything on my body to create scabs so i can pick at them, just wondering if anyone else is the same. I feel all alone even though i have a lovely family and a care manager but find it hard to talk to them. Thanks
