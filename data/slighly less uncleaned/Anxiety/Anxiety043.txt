Anxiety or inability to relax?Hi  I have started having tingling sensations in my feet and arms and constant stomach tensions last July while going through stressfull time in my life ( divorce, moving out of the house). Eventually visited my GP and was referred to a 'Coping With Worry' course. The course was great and interesting but after finishing course I had a feeling that this was not quite what I needed.I don't have anxieties and worries that would be bothering me but rather my inability to relax that keeps me in this state. I have always been quite a tense person, working in a demanding environment and aiming to be a high achiever. At the moment I am in a happy relationship , have stable life and great plans, however these symptoms still bother me a lot.It seems that I just can't relax and feel tense a lot, as it has became my habit now that i cannot let go.Should I try different relaxation techniques to see if it helps?Refexology? Psychoteraphy? Not sure what would be the best route now
