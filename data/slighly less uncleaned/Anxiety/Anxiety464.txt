Anxiety in the store...Hello everyone, it's been a while since I've been back here. Life has taken hold and has kept me pretty busy...ÊSo I've a question for anyone who wants to answer or just give their input. Do you ever get anxiety and/or a panic attack in the store? A grocery store, mall, restaurant, any place really that features a lot of people and general sensory input. I just want to know if I'm the only one who experiences this...I get the sweats, the shakes, blurred vision, dizziness, lightheaded, rapid breathing or trouble catching my breath and sometimes feeling faint. This doesn't happen as I'm entering the store but more towards the end of the trip, like at checkout or close to it. I usually feel better when I get home and back to calmer, familiar surroundings.Thank you for any input!
