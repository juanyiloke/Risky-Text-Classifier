not had a job for 20 yearsBecause of anxiety and panic, my husband is self employed and keeps me , i often feel so guilty about not getting a job but the fear is horrible .My husbands side of the family call me lazy and a mental case which only angers my husband , they don't like me at all its only my husband who sees his mum now he has nothing to do with the rest of them .ÊMy sister in law is the manager of the heart foundation shop and i am going to do an hour with her to help my self asteem , but i am really nervous about that .
