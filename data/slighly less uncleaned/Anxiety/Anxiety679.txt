Waking up in Panic Attacks.. Again? Can anyone help?Just woke up in a panic attack... Again... This is like the 20th time this year maybe more. It's almost getting on a every other night basis. I'll nod off I suppose then 20 minutes to an hour later I wake up either in a panic or like a few seconds after I wake up. I used to get these really bad when I first suffered from panic attacks and maybe randomly here and there but this is turning out to be way to frequent of a thing.. Like, I'm always convinced I'm dying and just feel like the GREAT sense of impending doom. A few of them I just woke up and didn't even know what I was worried about because I was just so afraid and everything felt wrong but there was no thing to point it to. But the one I just had/am having I guess I slept in my side wrong because my arm was numb and I felt like I was having a heart attack of some sort and even though I was 95% it was anxiety that 5% chance kills me. But does anybody know how to help and how to stop these?
