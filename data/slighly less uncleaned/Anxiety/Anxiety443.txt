Is it as deep and as entrenched as it feels ?With the GAD over the past 3 years now it feels like my mind is so intertwined with anxiety and it feels really deep and entrenched. My queston here is, is it really as bad as it feels? I feel like over the past 3 years I've developed so many bad thinking habits that it feels like I'll have to travel leaps and bounds to feel like myself again.... I've been trying to treat with other ways not including meds but clearly it's not working. I'm so scared of never getting out of this and if seems like it's gonna be really hard which makes it worse. I mean it can't be that bad I hope. If I get on a working med will my mind clear up and not feel so crowded and not have constant thought after thought?Ê I just don't get it and I felt like if I could get it, it would be alot easier on myself.... so again , is it as bad as it feels? Is it that hard to get under control especially with meds? Note that it's never stopped me from functioning, I still have a ton of friends, go out all the time, play a college sport, and get mostly As in school. It's just my find feels so far out ..... any input?
