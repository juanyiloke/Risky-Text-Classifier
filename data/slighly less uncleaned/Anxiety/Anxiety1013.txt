Fear of being attacked/being aloneThese fears go hand-in-hand. When Im around people, I am calm, but alone, all hell breaks loose. I have to be armed or else I start to feel like im being stalked. when Im alone, a knife has to be within arms reach after a few seconds. I am alone right now and I have a knife right next to my keyboard. I also have to have active conversations going on. If not, I am constantly paranoid of something bad happening. I cannot function without having a weapon nearby. I see people in my house sometimes. I remember a few months ago I was home alone and I never let go of my knife the entire time.
