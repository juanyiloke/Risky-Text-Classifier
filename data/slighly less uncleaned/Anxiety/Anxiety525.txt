pressure in front of head and eyesThis symptom is the one that freaks me out the most and although i have only had it twice i am terrified it will happen again .First episode happened last Saeptember when i was under a lot of stress with various things going on in my life and i walked out to the car with the keys and suddenly my head felt like it was in a vice and my eyes felt like they would pop out of the sockets my vision went slightly strange but it was not a migraine aura .I went to the doctors as i have to be reassured im not dying and my doctor did blood test for thyroid i had my blood pressure taken sitting lying standing i also got tested for diabetes braine tumor balance problems vertigo and all was fine . My ears are okay my eyes are okay , so i came out of the doctors feeling reassured and happy again and ready to overcome my anxieties .However i got worse as the months went by and my husband had to give up his evening job to be with me as i was a total wreck, i was back and forth to the doctors as i just didn't feel right , my doctor is wonderful bless her and she really does understand me .A month ago my husbands side of the family started arguing with him and one of them threw a brick through the front bay window and at the same time our youngest son had an argument with us and left home and wasn't speaking to us for weeks , all this caused me a lot of anxiety and then one saturday evening i was walking once again back to the car when the head pressure and horrible symptoms happened again , again it freaked me out but i didn't go to the doctors this time i just tried to get through it .I do believe i am getting better but this symptom is by far the scariest i have ever experienced in all of my years since suffering anxiety .ÊHas anyone else had this or am i just a one off /?thanks x
