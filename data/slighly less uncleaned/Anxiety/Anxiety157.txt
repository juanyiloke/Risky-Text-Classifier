Anxiety with bad physical symptoms Ê17    Having been suffering from anxiety for some years now but over the last 6 months physical symptoms have got quite bad. They include headaches, shaky hands and legs, electric shocks, vibrating feeling and neck and back pains. Been coping with it quite well for the last month. Was just wondering how long it has taken anyone for symptoms to subside mainly the shakes and weakness. These have been the most distressing symptoms for me and have contributed to my on going anxiety. Any input would help
