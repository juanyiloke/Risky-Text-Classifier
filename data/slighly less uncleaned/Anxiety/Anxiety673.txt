What to do when nothing calms you down?I felt really depressed yesterday which had me thinking a lot of bad thoughts. Getting to sleep was impossible, the thoughts and feelings of dread were overwhelming. I've hardly slept at all which is only making everything worse. How do I break this cycle? I can't focus on anything, not even my usual distractions like watching a film. I'm so scared I'm going crazy.Ê
