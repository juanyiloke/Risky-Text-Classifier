Constantly Upset/ComplainingHi, I'm a new member to this forum, so I'm not sure if this is in the right section.Ever since around grade 7 I've been constantly negative about everything that I do. I feel like whenever I receive a new project or task from school or home, I always approach it with a negative attitude. I've acknowledged this problem, but I'm not even sure if I have a mental disorder or not.ÊI used to play piano, but I hated it, I had absolutely no motivation to play the piano, but I continued it anyway. I eventually got to RCM 10 piano, which I did terribly on. Now, whenever people mention piano, I automatically fly into a rant about how much I suck and how everyone else is better than me. It's like I can't stop myself. I know it's going to be negative, but I can't help saying that I suck. This attitude is making me lose friends, because even in school, my initial reaction to every test is "I'm going to fail this". I know that I have to do something to change myself, and to make better choices, but I lack the motivation.So in the end I'm just always complaining and never taking action. I hate this about myself and I feel like I have no ability to stop myself.How can I fix it?Is there something wrong with me?
