Think I may have anxietyIt started in 2013 lost my grandad and was awaiting test results for my dad as he wasn't well When my grandad passed away I was on my way to work when my mum had phoned to say he had gone and she had to go and be with my gran as they live half a hour from us so I had to go home One day after this while at work I had to get sent home as I felt I couldn't breathe and felt like I had something stuck in my throat then 10 mins late to burst into tears Later that year dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. I've also noticed I get panicky if my daughter is even a few minutes late if she's been out playing I start to think what if this what if that's happened Also I worry about my health too recently even though I don't smoke or drink much. My main health worries are cancer heart attacks strokes or any type of blood clot. Panicked on Tuesday there as at round about 8pm I started to feel faint had to lie down and nibble on some chocolate had to get my daughter to bring in house phone as I was scared incase I did pass out what would she do as she's only 11 Was checked out at the hospital blood sugar was ok and he had no other concerns but I still feel panicky about my health I'm due a blood pressure check on Monday as when I was at the nurse 2 weeks ago getting a routine test done she aways checks my BP and weight I've put weight back on and BP was a little high so I've to go back Monday I feel ok now except for the aches and pains I'm experiencing in my back and side also for 2 days I was convinced I had diabetes Sorry for the long story but a lot to say lol xxxxPs work doesn't help matters much either
