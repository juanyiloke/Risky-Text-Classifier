Extreme OCD and Nihilism. Depressed.I seem to have become completely obsessed with nihilism to the point where i can no longer do anything without seeing any meaning in it. i literally cannot find joy in anything because it seems that i have broken through the "illusion" of life and everything and anything i do i break down to the core. oceans are no longer beautiful its just water. nothing looks beautiful and i am very bored. everything just seems bleak and repetitive. i cannot even feel emotion at this point from my girlfriend because I'm overanalyzing so much all i see when i look at people are atoms and skin and bones... just another organism. am i mad? am i depressed? am i a super genius who is able to see life for what it actually is so i can longer enjoy it? i want my old life back and I'm sad.. very sad when i think about my old life and how happy i was i break down and cry. i feel like I've opened a new conscious and i can't go back. i also have derealization and depersonalization and I'm hyper aware of my own existence.. its hard to explain but it makes me panic. its like I'm aware that I'm alive and that I'm apart of reality. please help.
