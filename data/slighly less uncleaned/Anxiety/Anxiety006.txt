Anxiety effecting every part of my life.I wake up usually completly normal feeling, sometimes its hard to get out of bed though and feel almost shaky.Im 23 years old, and i just cant stop this what i think is anxienty.I just got a new job serving at buffalo wild wings and i just cant keep eye contact with out feeling euphoric and shaky. I feel dumb in my head, and i feel people see this and wonder wtf is wrong with me. i tend to lose train of thought and cant keep conversations going. I believe i think about it so much it makes it even worst. Also, when im tlaking my right eye starts to sag lower then my other eye only in conversations, which makes me look like im completly mental disabled i think. I constantly think people are talking about me in bad ways and think this may effect my job and thats the last thing i need right now because of bills and what not.What is going wrong in my head? am i mentally ILL / disabled.(Ive been in many fights, experienmented with drugs and feel like it caught up to me but its wierd cause when im alone i dont shake/twitch/and feel completly normal.)Is twitching/feeling shaky/ and cant carry on with conversations without completly feeling awkward an axiety issue or is this something else.I feel i have been battleing with this for qiute some times (3-4 years).
