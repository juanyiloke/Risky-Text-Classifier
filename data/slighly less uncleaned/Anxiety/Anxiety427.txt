Brain fog???Does anyone experience brain fog during (or even in the aftermath of) periods of heightened anxiety?  I've had brain fog for 6 months--at times I just feel detached, have difficulty remembering things I would not normally have difficulty remembering, walking into a room and forgetting what I walked in there for, trouble processing info and concentrating, etc. It's driving me nuts. Makes me think I have some bad neuro disorder or brain tumor or something. I had this happen one other time, back when my undiagnosed GAD was at its peak--but it dissipated after about a month or so. This current period has lasted much longer Sexual issues (possible TMI)I don't know if it's anxiety or what causing this but I've found it incredibly hard to maintain an erection recently. Does anyone else have this problem? It's fine if I "service" myself but when I'm in bed with my girlfriend it's damn near impossible. Why? I'm not really very anxious around her at all, but now I'm starting to worry that if I don't fix this problem soon she'll leave me (though she said she wouldn't even think about leaving me for that.) Any remedies other than pills? Pausible causes? Things I can do?
