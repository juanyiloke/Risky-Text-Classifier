anxiety and panic attacks!Hi. I suffer from health anxiety previously mentioned in another post. Im constantly worrying something is seriously wrong with me all the time. About 2 months   i coughed up a tiny bit of blood from bursting a blood vessel this has really scared me and now i think the worst ive had an x ray and that came back clear but i think they have missed something or now i have throat cancer. This worrying sets off a panic attack . All my throat goes tight, im constantly putting my fingers in my mouth to see if im bleeding again. And constantly coughing to try and clear my throat as it feels like there is something there all the time. I m at my witts end. I just want to feel normal again. Im on propanolol and citalopram.
