"Give it 15 Minutes" MethodA method to try that has helped me immensely…That familiar feeling of fear creeps up on us so easily and convincingly that we can't tell we're being tricked. An anxious mind is constantly looking for something to fear. It grabs on to anything it can and flashes a fearful thought through our minds-- then waits for our reaction. Usually, our reaction is to panic. This sends us through the cycle of fear. A simple thought… leads to panic… leads to physical symptoms… causing further panic… etc. This is the pattern that keeps anxiety going. It sounds so simple to spot right? Not so much. These thoughts are SO good at convincing our already overstressed, overworked minds that it's very difficult to just brush them aside. The "give it 15 minutes" method… the next time you have that flash of fear, don't react. Instead, sit with the thought for 15 minutes. See if the thought is as intense as it was when it first popped into your mind as it is 15 minutes later. Even if it's a physical symptom, give it 15 minutes. Sit with it, try as hard as you can to not react to it. What you'll usually find is that the thought has lost its intensity after some time has passed. Once you can let these thoughts pass you by more and more often, you'll begin to regain some confidence in yourself and your ability to control your panic. Fearful thoughts pop into our minds so quickly that it becomes second nature to react with panic… which is what keeps the anxiety cycle going. Let the thoughts pass you by. Before you know it, you'll experience less and less of these fearful thoughts which will lead you on the road to recovery. It's not the maze that you think it is.
