New puppy and Anxiety???I know this will sound pathetic, but we just adopted the most adorable puppy four days ago and my anxiety is sky high??? I definitely wasn't expecting this and it is really bothering me. Actually had a small panic attack one night. There has been a lot going on in our family the last few months, so maybe it is just "another change" and this will pass? The puppy is only 12 weeks old so of course lots of work "potty training" her etc... She really is a lovely little thing though, so I'm sure this is just temporary, but the anxiety has been bad enough that I can barely eat or sleep.... I think I just need some encouraging words? And I'm not one to normally ask... I guess this all just took me by surprise. I know she will be worth all this though!!! She really is lovely!!!
