Scared to go on my vacation....Hi everyone,I have been plagued with GAD for along time! Since I can remember...recently my fear is centred around ALS - scariest disease in the planet ! I feel I have symptoms... and it is ruining my life...I don't like getting up and walking around my house because I am scared that my legs feel stiff and one day they are going to give out! I am suppose to go on a wonderful sunny vacation in two days and i'm petrified....i'm scared that something is going to go wrong and I am going to ruin the trip. I am scared that I am going to have a foot drop, leg drop, wrist drop, Please help Yours, Lilly
