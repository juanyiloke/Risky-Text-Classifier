Chronic fatigue 24/7 caused by years of anxiety?! Ê6    For over 4 months, 24/7 (happened over night) I've been feeling like I haven't had a good nights sleep, body feel feels not sleepy tired, but like a unrefeshed feeling. My eyes feel heavy all the time. My joints and muscles feel tense and achey, always stretching them. Sleeping never makes any difference. I can't sleep till 2am ever since it started 4 months  . I'm sweating more than often a lot more. Is this cronic fatigue. I'm only 19. Or has anyone been the same? Thanks.
