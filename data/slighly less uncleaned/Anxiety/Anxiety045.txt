talking helps massively but who to?Hi, i have had anxiety since 2006. 2006 and the first half of 2007 were horrible but since mid 2007 my anxiety has been very mild so life has been pretty normal which was great. However in february this year i ended up in hospital due to a non related issue and since then the anxiety has got worse and yesterday and today in particular has been preety bad, in my early suffering i found talking to people, fellow sufferers extremely beneficial as a help each other tool. What do others think about this? I would love to help others and others help me as non sufferers do not understand. Just incase any confusion i mean talking by telephone. I was lucky and am lucky that i do have a form of telephone support but it is fairly infrequent and talking really helps me. What does everyone think?
