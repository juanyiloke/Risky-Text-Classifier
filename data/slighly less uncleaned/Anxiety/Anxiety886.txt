 I am just so lost!Hi,I am new. I have never used anything like this before and apologise if I waffle on  I am a mum of two, married, lots of family and friends. But the main thing in my life is a cloud over my head called depression. I suffer badly (worse I think than anyone close to me realises) with stress and anxiety, I've had panic attacks and tried self harming when I was in my teens (I'm in my 30s now) I've had suicidal thoughts, postnatal depression which was left untreated. I feel like getting up and leaving, becoming a missing person for a few years. But when My head clears I think what a selfish person I must be to even contemplate doing that when I have two children who love their mum! My mum, dad and husband confronted me a few years ago and made me go to the drs (at a peak of depression) I was given Citalopram and had a great dr, who sent me for CBT and offered counselling. I must admit the tablets don't work for me, but my dr left the surgery and the receptionists were so unhelpful, so since then I have just been plodding along with citalopram and seeing different doctors who all have a different view on my condition, one told me he wouldn't sign me off for more than 2 weeks (in other words pull yourself together) i felt really pressured (it was the first time I've actually had to ring in sick because of my issues) its got to the point now, where I cant face going to the docs.The thing is, its getting worse, and not going away. My husband and family are understanding, in short doses....if that makes sense. My husband likes to push me to pick myself up, but just doesn't get that some days its physically impossible for me to be pushed. I am overcome by guilt, i know people have worse things going on in their lives. But i still feel so low. I just need to know Im not alone, and suggestions on what I can do to dig myself out of this hole, because. I know I am spiralling. Thank you, for anyone who takes any time to even read these words x
