Anxiety and marriageI have been married for almost 12 years now and feel as if anxiety, depression, panic attacks is ruining my marriage. I thought my husband was supportive, patient and my best friend, but now I think he has been putting up with me and it hurts so bad. He says he will go to counseling with me for years but hasn't. We argue over everything and he just pushes me away. I tell him how I feel and he just tells me what he thinks I want to hear.ÊHow do I get him to be serious about my feelings and understand about living with anxiety?Any advice will help
