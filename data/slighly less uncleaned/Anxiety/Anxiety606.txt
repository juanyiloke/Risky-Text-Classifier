believingin urself and reasurancehi as you all know ive been struggling for yrs with anxiety and ive always kept asking for reassurance I/e helplines or on here and not believing in myself and always looking for answers but just over a week ago I just said to myself feck iti m not going to fight it anymore so for the past week I have been trying to believe in myself and not ask for reassurance and instead of reaching for the fone to call someone because of the way I feel instead Ive been learning to reassure myself and stop myself from foning helplines or come on here and just try to let it be there and calm myself down, its been very hard doing it and it will take time but I just think that by learning to believe in myself and cut down on asking for reassurance it maybe will help me on the road to recovery or to be able to mange the anxiety a lot better and not be fraid of the anxiety because that's what ive been doing for the past 9yrs afraid of it x
