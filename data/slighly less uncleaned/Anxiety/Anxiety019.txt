Anxiety has just hit me out of the blueCannot eat, cannot sleep, have trouble breathing, cannot think straight or make sensible decisions.ÊSeveral months   I lost my job. I have since secured a much better one, but it is overseas and would involve me leaving my adult children behind. One is going into his second year of uni. The other is about to take a year off uni due to his own anxiety issues and increasing certainty that his course is not right for him and is a waste of time. He's supposed to get a part time job, manage the house, look after his grandpa and our pets. I'll come home twice a year. None of this seems like a reason to be so consumed with anxiety that I can barely function. The anxiety hit me like an avalanche on Monday. I've never experienced anything like ths before, not even when I got divorced and had to move countries and find a new job with two small kids in tow.ÊI am afraid for my son. I am afraid he will not find a job, that he will never be able to cope with life. I am afraid of removing my protective presence from his life. I think constantly of the worst possible scenarios and console myself with the thought that there's always suicide if things get too bad.ÊWhat is wrong with me? What should I do?
