ÊHyper-sensetivity upon wakingJuly 2013 I lost a loved one and immediately had symptoms of ptsd and panic attacks. Started taking low dose of zoloft and lorezapam on occasion. Slowly things started to improve but I was always waking up too early. Then Dec 2013, I started having panic attacks upon waking in the morning and tremors and high anxiety all day. Saw a psychiatrist and switched meds to Cymbalta and higher dosage. Panic attacks went away and anxiety went down, but I continued to have a form of hyper sensitivity / anxiety that kicks in as soon as I wake up.It happens every time I wake up. I can be sleeping fine and start to wake up. I feel fine as I'm waking up, but then suddenly I feel a flushing sensation go through my body. I start to hear a hissing, white-noise. If I keep my eyes closed, I'll start to see different geometric patterns in my head (like seeing stars when you press your eyes). My skin starts to feel clammy, or cold sweaty, maybe a little tingly in my arms and legs. I start to feel nervous. Its impossible to doze back off after this starts. Some morning I can doze a few times before it starts, but once it starts its like an alarm going off in my body. Once out of bed, this state will persist through breakfast, all morning and into noon. After I eat lunch, I slowly start to settle down and feel a little better. Usually by late afternoon or night I feel best, but not perfect.ÊTo me it feels like some hormonal or chemical imbalance. My sleep is fine. My dreams are normal. I can sometimes wake up and be lying in bed relaxing, feeling fine, then I feel this thing kick in, like some system somewhere in my body just came online and started pumping too much of some chemical.ÊI've gone to an endocrinologist who did blood work and found nothing wrong. I'm scheduled for a coritsol stem test in a week.Anybody dealt with this type of thing -- have any idea what it could possibly be ?Thanks
