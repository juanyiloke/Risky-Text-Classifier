ÊWhat coping techniques for panic and anx do you find work?As the title says which ones do you find help the best, in crowds, on transit, in church ect anywhere triggering really.I find staying in the moment where you freeze frame an obect you see A tree a leaf,in your mind and see it,feel it's textures, it's flaws, watch it's movements, smell it, define it thouroughly help most.I used deep breathing yoga exercises a lot too.....3 regular breaths then hold the fourth deep down to you diaphram or belly chakra center, exhale superslow, three regular breaths and repeat till calmed
