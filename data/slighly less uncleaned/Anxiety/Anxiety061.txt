Anxiety about my headachesHello everyone, I suffer from extreme health anxiety and anxiety in general. I've been having headaches for almost 2 years now and last year I had a CT done of my head without contract dye since it was done in emerge. I keep having these headaches and with each headache and head pressure comes the anxiety. TMI but I was intimate with my boyfriend last night for the first time and I felt a lot of pressure in my head when I climaxed. My right hand was then stiff for about 15 mins. It has freaked me out and he checked my pupils to see if I was alright as he had suffered a head injury before and knows what to look for. He was then telling me about his ex who lived in another country who all of a sudden had a dilated pupil. She suffered from migraines since she was a kid and turns out she had an aneurysm. Luckily it was caught early but now that he told me that story I am freaking out. It's bad enough I keep fearing an Aneurysm and can't find any info on head CT scans without contrast dye and if they can detect weakened blood vessles and potential aneurysms  I need reasurance please! Bad enough I already freak about getting Cancer and misdignoses.
