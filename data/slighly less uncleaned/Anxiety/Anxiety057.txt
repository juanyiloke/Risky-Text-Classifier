I have had no major side effects but the thoughts and anxiety have not lessened. The doctor increased dosage today to 30mg and for this to be reviewed in 4 weeks on 4.6.2015.I rightly or wrongly agreed to this? Is it a good idea?Has anyone else had the dosage increased fron 20mg to 30mg. Did it cause side effects and did it improve your condition.Thanks for your inputHelp I feel like im dying!!I'm 17 female and feel like I have the flu but I don't I feel really week before and in the middle of sleeping I gasped for air I threw up today and I have diarrhea my left arm feels week and my heart feels week I don't really do much I don't have an appetite every time I eat I feel sick I'm over weight I feel like my heart is just going to stop or have heart failure or just die I'm so scared this all can'tbbe health anxiety can it but my heart is not beating fast please help I'm scared
