Revolving Door MoodsTonight I have the revolving door moods. Normally I don't have a mood at all. Most days, even when I am anxious or depressed, I am still the same old me, cheerful, upbeat, amicable, pleasant (hormonal days and panic attacks notwithstanding). Anger is an emotion I feel maybe a handful of days a year if that. Anger, for me, is volatile and frightening. Somehow the kid managed to evoke real anger from me while she did what a teenager does best, argue. I handled it like a champ with stern yet even tones, sent her to her friend's house to study, and once alone I raged, kicking the tree in the backyard, punching the shed, shouting like a lunatic. Mind you I am perfectly composed most days and this sort of toddler style tantrum is way out of character for me.ÊThe rage was over in less than 5 minutes and here comes the tears. I sit down on the ground, cry more when I realize the ground is muddy, even more still when the ants show up.Ê30 minutes later, showered and slathered with benadryl cream I was on top of the world. I probably called 7 or 8 people I hadn't spoken to in months just to say hi.ÊNow I am just exhausted. I think I might actually be able to sleep without the trazadone tonight.ÊHow do I prevent this from reoccurring? I am still relearning how to feel at all so I don't even know what to do to prevent this from ocurring again. Thoughts?
