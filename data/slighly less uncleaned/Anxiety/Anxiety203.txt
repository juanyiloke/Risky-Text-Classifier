What are your symptoms?This is a thread that I think will help. It's always nice to hear that folks share similar symptoms so they know they aren't alone.What are the symptoms of your beginning stages of anxiety or depression? I never had depression, but I did have severe anxiety. My panic attacks started with the felling of having a lump in my throat. That triggered complete panic and I began breathing heavily. My mind was racing so much that I became dizzy and scared. I was also very tired.Who was in this boat?
