please help me. extreme dentist phobiaHi. A tooth has been bothering me for 2 weeks and today i went to the dentist. He wanted to do a filling today asap but couldnt because when trying to do xrays i would gag horribly. So i left ashamed and scared. Im currently going crazy. I havent go to the dentist in 2 years because of my fear. I finally went today only because i read i could die from a tooth infection...But now im considering letting myself die since im super scared of having a filling or even worsea ROOT CANAL. Im also scared of gagging and that the xrays show i need more work to be done. What can i do? I have been craying the last 5 hours...help
