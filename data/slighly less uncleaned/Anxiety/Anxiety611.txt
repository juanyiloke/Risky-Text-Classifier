Goal for the Day - All are WelcomeSome of you may be familiar with "SMART" Goals. Goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. SMART goals are helpful because they show success in a brief amount of time. They are realistic, they aren't setting the bar too high, and you can be held accountable too  Overall achieving these goals increases your successes, self-esteem, and self-confidence that you can do this! If we do it as a group, we can support each other.I think setting some smart goals for myself will help me get through my current blip. I used to do this when my HA was bad or my anxiety about anything was getting difficult. Now it is rearing it's ugly head again and I have to take charge of the situation before it takes charge of me. I am going to post a SMART goal and then will post later if I have achieved it. I invite others to join in and set SMART goals for themselves. For today, my goal is to leave my lymph node behind my ear alone until 5 PM. It is 9 AM here right now. I have been prodding it too much and that is not helping it go away nor is it helping my anxiety. I think it is realistic, will be a challenge but not impossible.Feel free to set goals for yourself on this thread if you want to join.
