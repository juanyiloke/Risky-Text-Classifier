That unsteady feelingHey there, I made a previous post and it was too long winded I feel so I'll make this short and sweet.Long story short I started having these things happen where when I had some sort of stressful enviroment, id catch myself spacing out and then BAM, I would get a frantic unsteady off balance feeling and panic and I would need to leave wherever I was.The 4th time this happened was December 23rd though this time I wasnt able to escape the situation and the feelings stuck and wouldnt leave.  I've been having them daily since then  and I went through periods where I wouldnt leave the house alone, or go in car rides with people who were intolerant of panic attacks, I also avoided going in stores and walking long distances especially when no "safe car" or "safe person" was around.I've been working harder lately to the point where I can go out nearly anywhere as long as I'm not alone, I can take the bus with my gf, I went on a walk 45 minutes from my house and back with a friend and didn't freak out.I guess the worst part is I keep thinking "what if its not anxiety...." and my paranoia sets in and I think stuff like; inner ear problems, thyroid problems, blood pressure problems etcexcept my blood pressure was checked and came out normal (usually high at doctors but i guess i was too distracted by my balance feelings for white coat syndrome.also I dont have any ear infectionsfood/water or lack of doesnt make or break my sensationsI'm able to ride a bike, do yoga, have sex, and do light weight lifting just fine tooSo TLDR; I have an off balance/unsteady feeling that persists daily when I'm on my feet and it doesnt seem to correspond wit h any physical cause so i'm pretty sure my brain is perpetuating it.
