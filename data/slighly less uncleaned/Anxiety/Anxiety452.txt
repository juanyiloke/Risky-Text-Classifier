Someone Please Respond....Have any of you ever had where you are just sitting or standing somewhere calmly and you suddenly feel your body go numbish (NOT tingly), you feel like you can't breathe, you feel as if your going to pass out (that might have been in my head), you start shaking, you get nauseated, your jaw starts to hurt, get a headache, etc??? The onset of this is what seriously freaked me out....the sudden numbness thing.Can that be caused by me holding my breath and not realizing it???I do have breathing issues 24/7 because of my anxiety....hyperventalation syndrome...breathing to fast, breathing to deep, holding my breath, etc.I need to learn how to breathe...I know, but could that be the cause of all this???I'm just so tired of this...I am always terrified  This just happened to me, I'm at work, and no one can even tell....So, I just freak out inside my head...and it's so scary in here.
