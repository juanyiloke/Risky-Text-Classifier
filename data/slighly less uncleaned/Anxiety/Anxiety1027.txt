Can't Function Regularly Due to My Anxiety *Trigger WarningsI'm new to the forum, and I hope this is the right place to put this. Hello everyone  Anyway, I suffer from extreme anxiety and intrusive thoughts, and it's gotten so bad I can't function anymore.I have a few examples1) I have these unwanted (intrusive) thought of being raped or me ending up killing somebody I love. I tell myself that these fears are irrational and God would never put me through this but it only makes my anxiety levels raise for some strange reason. I have them everyday and they make me really uncomfortable. I also can't get the thoughts out of my head and they usually linger for extended periods of time. I also have this OC (Original Character) I really love and I get IT of them getting raped too. (AKA somebody making a rape fic about them)2) I also recently went back to m**********ing (I don't know if I should censor it but I will JIC) and there is this one thing I can't "do it" to not matter what, or else I have to give it up and I really don't want to. I was "doing it" recently and I remember myself zoning out to the video and then my mind (intrusive thoughts) brings up that thing I can't "do it" to. I've gotten some advice before saying "If your intrusive thoughts bring it up and you never intended to then it doesn't count as you m**********ing to it and you're okay." but I've been freaking out because my anxiety tells me "Nope. You did it, give it up!" and I can't focus because my mind brings it up ever second of the day and I have to sit down and think.3) I always fear that I'm going to get some incurable disease and that if I die, nobody would miss me...This is getting really out of hand for me. I'll summarize it in questions:1) Is there a way to get rid of intrusive thoughts? If so, how?2) If your IT got in the way of you "doing it" and an unwanted image pops up, does that mean you "Did it" to that thought? (Bonus question: If you "Do it" to the thought of someone, like a cartoon character, are you technically M*********ing to that person and yourself?)3) How can I prevent my hypochondria from getting the best of me?Sorry, that was unnecessarily long but this has gone way too far. Please help...
