ÊAnxiety and DepressionHi im 21 years old and I have been suffering with anxiety and depression for about a year now. I have ended up being off work on the sick twice now for the illness and currently am in the position. Im a very stressed person finding it hard to stay asleep at night having nightmares every night and recently my depression has caused me to want to take my own life. I turned to the samaritans for help but their reply to my emails is was anything up to 12 hours and i didnt really find that very helpful for me that is why i have turned to this type of support. I also am afraid that there are cameras when i go to peoples homes and also in my own home. like people are watching me through my phone and xbox. I also think that my friends are always talking about me behind my back and that they are doing things to single me out or that theyre pretending to like me when they really dont. I cant relax and feels like im trying to listen to 10 different things in my head at once so i cant concentrate on one single thing properly. I also suffer from OCD probably as a result of the anxiety meaning i have to stare at things for a long time to try and convince my mind that its real. I also have to touch things and count to 5. I hope someone has some insight and maybe someone who has similar problems so i can have someone to relate to.
