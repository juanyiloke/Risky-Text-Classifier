symtoms are getting to weird
I had a slow heart rate most of yesterday today I felt great I have cleaned even getting ready for a night out but weird symtoms are occurring and I'm Not wanting to ruin my first night put properly in 7 months !
symtoms are
deep dull pain lasts seconds but intense in top of head.
Doom to the point my body kinda hunches.
white flashes before my eyes.
head feels warm inside and weird kinda mushy if that makes sence .
pressuee in ears like heads hanging upside down .
nausea
clickin/ grinding feeling in head mainly when the fast pain comes on
anybody had this im scared it's a anyrsm or something
