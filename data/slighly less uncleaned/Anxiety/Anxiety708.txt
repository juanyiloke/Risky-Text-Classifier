My story so farHi All,I've been hovering around this website for a few months now, thought I would say Hi and post my journey so far.Almost 12 months ago I had what the medical world don't like to call a breakdown from stress and overstimulation of my body and brain. Although i had always suffered with anxiety, I didn't realise what it was so it didn't affect my life. The realisation is what changed it!I now suffer from GAD, Health anxiety and an obsession with my breathing. 10 months ago it all got too much and visited my doctor who suggested citalopram, I lasted 5 days on these but the side effects were so bad I stopped and was determined to get through this drug free. I've done well bit every day brings pain and worry of some sort.I've decided to try Mirtazipine and took my first dose last night. So far no major side effects to report!!
