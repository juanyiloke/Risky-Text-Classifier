who am I? Hi all I'm a newbie and really struggling tonight, think my friends probably have their own problems, so I thought some fellow tortured souls could help lol.I've been suffering from depression for about 5 yes but last year it really came to a head and I had a bit of a meltdown which resulted in 6 months off work, whilst off my employers referred me for free cognitive therapy which I found really helped and seemed to be on the road to happiness well slight normal ness , until the last few weeks where I have been seriously doubting if after 20 yes of marriage my husband actually loves me.He's never been the romantic big gesture type but I have changed significally and now finding that I need more attention.He's away working this eve and I messaged him to say I'm not feeling to good, that my brain was overreacting and being imaginative again, and his reply was " I don't know what to say about that!" Well don't say anything pick up the blooming phone and ask me what's wrong?The thing is, I don't know if this is me expecting too much or am I right to think that maybe he's not giving me what I need?Its like I don't know who I am and I'm definitely not the slim confident blonde that he married.I'm feeling really low about it tonight and just can't stop crying. I want to phone him and tell him to wake up!!!!!!!! But what if its me and I just drive him away?
