Ups and Downs - zoloft I am on week 5 of taking zoloft 50mg. The 1st 3 weeks were very tough - higher anxiety, intrusive thoughts and little sleep. ÊI then started feeling much better, would not have near as many low times. ÊNow today after quite a few good days I woke up and instantly felt the same I did prior to starting the zoloft. ÊIs it normal for this to happen? I was under impression once it started working you usually kept you in good place. ÊI have tried breathing excercises and going to gym but can't seem to lift spirits. Ê
