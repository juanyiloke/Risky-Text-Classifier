ÊI have no friends Êjakelee123,Ê3  My last "friend" today told me that she would not like to ever see me again. This made me think back on what life really is. If i have no one worth living for, whats the point of living? My "friend" hanna just told me that she is never going to see me again for a year. We've been best friends since the beginning of middle school and now we're in the same college together. Every time i message her, she ignores me until the next week. I ask her to play games with me, or eat, or just hang out but her answers always the same. "I'm sorry jake, I'm too busy for you. Go make some new friends, loner". It tore me up that day when she said that. How could someone so important... So valuable to me say that i'm a loner? Just the other day she told me that i was just a thought to her. Just a past thought, andnow that she has moved on, I feel so distant from her. This is the end of my rant and I hope that it will be better in the future.
