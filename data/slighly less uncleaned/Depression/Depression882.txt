Low PointHello everyone. I hope you're all doing well. I decided to take Wellbutrin about 2 weeks ago and at first I felt really good. Now I feel very sad and lonely and anxious. More than usual. This is a new low for me.ÊI've been isolating myself from my friends, even though they haven't been talking to me much at all. They don't really try to understand my mental health and gender identity issues, so I've been distancing myself from them. I can't seem to find a job and I'm very broke at the moment. I live with my mom and she's amazing and if it weren't for her, I don't know what I'd do. I'm just very sad and lonely...I'm struggling in my grad school program right now and it's making me feel so stupid. Also I just feel like people hit me up to brag about their accomplishments or to tell me good news and that's it. They just walk out of my life after they've used me. I'm tired of that.ÊI just feel very stuck, as if I'm in a box and I'm slowly losing air. I worry that I'll be like this for the rest of my life. I have chronic depression and I've been this way for the past 10 years of my life. I thought that would have changed, but now I'm in my 20s and it's worse and I feel lost. I feel like no one will ever take the time to understand me and form a relationship with me...What do you guys do when you're in one of your low points?
