Moving Out Of My Parents HouseÊ  crhatfield2013 ,Ê03 May 2015Please help, I'm 20 years old and I'm moving out of my parents house for the first time. Although I'm moving in with my boyfriend, so I won't be alone, I'm moving 6 hours away. I've never been away from my parents or siblings for more than a few days so knowing it will be months between the times I see them scares me. We move in 8 days, I was excited at first and am still excited but every time I think about it now my anxiety goes through the roof. I tense up, I have a hard time breathing, I guess it seems silly but I've never been more terrified of anything in my life. Someone please help me, give me tips on how it will get easier or something. I have to do this but I'm afraid I can't
