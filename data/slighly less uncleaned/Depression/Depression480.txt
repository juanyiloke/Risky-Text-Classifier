Can't Stop Being Sad.Ê  Waning Sunshine ,Ê25 Apr 2015I wish I could live in my dreams forever. Go to sleep and never wake up again. My dreams are much better than real life. I can experience love there. Things I can't seem to experience in real life. I feel happy and relieved in my dreams and wish they would just always go forever. They don't though. I lived my life for years trapped in the house after highschool. Just recently with medication I was able to get a minimum wage part time job. Where I get to work with nice people. Then the thought in my head says it's time to be melancholic. So I feel sad and people can see that and tell me to cheer up and that things will be okay. My depression is highly visible to others I think. Yet I put on my fake smile at times and then I get told to stop being fake. Is there a way for me to be happy? I can't fake emotions very well. I've been drinking every night for the past week. Alone in the dark and listening to music. I find the alcohol mixed with my seroquel gives me nice dreams.This is my drug.Ê
