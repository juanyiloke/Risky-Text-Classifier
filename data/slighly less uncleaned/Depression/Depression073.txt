hell on earth Well as per usual things didn't go as planned, I got hammered drunk and was already suicidal and the alcohol didn't help.....so what did I do....set myself and my flat on fire......i was dead pulled out the flat but the firemen resuscitated me an it was touch an go apparently. I cant remember a thing but I remember the smoke alarm going nuts. Mental health hosp wouldn't accept me as I was under the influence so I was put into police custody and charged 3 days later with arson. I got bail but very restricted so I cant retrieve what's left or even go see my daughter. And possibly 5 years in jail.....this truly is a low feeling
