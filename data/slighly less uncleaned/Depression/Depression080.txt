Feeling alone...depressed... Im a 20 year old guy.I dont really know how to start this...Recently i decided to start cutting people off my life who i felt were holding me back in one way or the other.They didnt have ambitions,any dreams and they were desperate for women but never got laid.They were always like "guys we need to get laid,we need some sex" and they said that for the last years,since they were 13-14 (now 20-21) without any success.Half of them are virgins and most of them never even kissed a girl. Me myself i've met several girls by myself,had a few girls here and there but still never had a relationship...My old friends dont have any ambitions and no goals or anything...they all just want to smoke and drink,and just criticize other people and be desperate and miserable.They say things like "no girls will ever go with us cause we dont have a nice body or a nice car" "all girls are just selfish and want a rich guy" etc. etc. This just makes me miserable.I want to go out there and meet new people and girls,be in social groups,go on trips,go to parties but i just feel alone.I'm not in university or college and i dont have a job...I feel so alone...I dont really know where to meet new people who are ambitious and not miserable and pessimistic...
