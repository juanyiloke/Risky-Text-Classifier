Can't get on top of lifeI am retired and comfortable with a good Wife, we have been married for over 40 years. I had heart surgery in 2006 and last year I had a ICD implanted.I feel useless and cannot get on top of living with this condition. I know all the things that I am lucky to be alive etc. etc. doesn't help.I wake in the morning just black and that can last some time, it also can hit me for no reason and for no reason and make my life pointless. There are times that I am hit with just anger for no reason, not anger that I would hurt anyone just anger at life.Finding it hard to deal with
