  No meaning  Lady Rose, 3   123Nothing I do has any meaning or impact. I'm not missed when I leave. Others are missed when they go away, and people long for their return. People can't wait until I ****ing leave. I don't know, man. It's just a wee bit depressing when you try to help people even though you feel like a tub of shit all the time, even trying to talk virtual strangers out of committing suicide, yet no one, probably not even your own relatives, would really give a flying **** if you dropped dead. No one would be negatively affected by me ceasing to exist. I tell people about my problems and pretty much get told "yeah, that sucks dude. Good luck with that situation." I want to make it clear that I don't help people to get rewards or recognition, but because I genuinely care and hate to see people hurting. Also, I appreciate the kindness and support I've been shown by people on this forum, very much. And no, I'm not making any plans to off myself, couldn't follow through with it if I tried. At times I wish I could work up the nerve to just get it the **** over with though. Anyways, feel free to disregard this entire post. Wouldn't blame ya.
