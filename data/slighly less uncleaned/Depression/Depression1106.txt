Will I ever feel normal again ?Hi all just want to tell my story, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was a painfully shy and self conscious child and teenager, I had very few friends and found it very hard to relate to girls. I met my now ex husband when I was 18 and moved in with him after 2 weeks together. We had 3 children and we're together for 16 years before he left. Although we were both unhappy, him leaving absolutely devastated me, I'd lost my family. ÊI was diagnosed with PND in 2006 after my 2nd child was born, and have been on AD ever since. Since the breakup I slipped into a deep depression and life has been a constant battle ever since. I've let myself go, put on 20kgs and generally hate myself. When I'm having a really down episode, I won't leave the house, I feel very anxious, I sleep a lot, and just lock myself away from the world.ÊI have 3 healthy, beautiful and happy kids, but I'm scared I have damaged them as they saw me hit rock bottom. The only reason I'm still walking this earth is because of them.ÊI know I need to exercise to be healthier mentally and physically, but the thought of going to a gym or walking the streets makes me so anxious,ÊI'm so grateful to have a roof over my head, food on the table and healthy kids, but the constant struggles in my head make it hard to be happy.Anyway enough of my whinging, have a great day. ?
