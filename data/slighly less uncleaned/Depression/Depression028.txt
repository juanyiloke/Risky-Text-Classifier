planned my suicide I've been depressed for many months now, in the past I've been in a mental hospital came out thought things was ok, more recent I've had major thoughts on how to end my life, every day I go out I walk over a train line my thought is to wait for a heavy goods train and jump off the bridge as it passes under me hitting the wagons ending my life for good. End of conversation goodbye all
