I Need Some AdviceÊ  indigoblue ,Ê30 Apr 2015So I've been struggling with depression for most of my life, mostly un medicated, aside from self medication. I've tried several anti depressants and all of them made me feel worse rather than better, granted never long term. Maybe I gave up too soon. But right now I'm experiencing a wave of depression on a whole other level. It feels like my consciousness is very constricted and I have lost all spark for life and all the hobbies I once enjoyed, I really have no mental energy for anything. I've experienced similar episodes before but this one is extremely bad and I'm willing to try meds again. Almost anything would be better than feeling like this. it's rather inexplicable really how these episodes start and why they subside. It's almost as if the stars align in a certain way for a period of time and i'm under the influence of some strange confluence. I don't really mean this literally but it might as well because of the mysterious nature of these episodes. Anyways I need to feel better....like soon. So can I get a little feedback from people who have been in the same position and which medication has worked for you? Thanks
