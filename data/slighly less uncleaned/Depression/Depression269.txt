ÊBetter late than never ÊHealing2015,Ê2  I've had depressions since I left college. It's in my genes. I worked for over ten years before falling apart. I hit an abusive period in my life and for a few years I just wanted to die.I'm better depression wise. I'm mildly depressed now but that's my norm anyway.I've been off work three years. My benefits are being assessed now. My interview is tomorrow. I'm not going for pip. They can shove it. I've barely eaten for a month. Constant anxiety. Shove it.My ESA will run out soon. I intend to get a job asap. An easy part time job.I'm not able emotionally to cope with benefit assessments. Maybe I'm being sent a sign. Get back to work. Put it all behind you and get your life started.ÊI'm so scared but I can't cope with assessments. Out of the fire and into the frying pan?I have considered suicide a lot the past month. This seems the only solution. It is suicide or work. I have to work.I'm scared though. Scared I'll crack again and be homeless.
