A Top Student Failed In The Last Semester Exam, Cannot GraduateÊ  LHunter ,Ê27 Apr 2015My daughter is her final semester of her undergraduate business degree. She is a very good hardworking student (on the Dean's Honor list) with a GPA of 3.75. She has obtained admission offers to several top business schools across the world in the master of business program (MIM/MIF). She accepted an offer from a top US business school (in a program that commences this summer) and courteously rejected the offers from the other schools. After paying the initial fees and housing deposit, she was all set to commence her graduate studies in June this year.ÊAlas, misfortune struck. She failed in one of her core subjects in the final semester (in spite of her sincere preparation), an exam worth 100% of marks with no options for extra credit/assisgnment to boost the grade. She will not be able to graduate this May and can repeat the course only in the fall semester at the earliest. She is completely devastated, depressed and refuses to talk to anybody. As her dad, I am trying to be as supportive as possible. We know she is in real pain and several months of effort, hard work and dreams got shattered all of a sudden.ÊWhat can I do to help her? Would the other schools (that she rejected) reconsider her application and defer her admission to a later term or year? How can we communcate to the currently accepted school (her dream school) about her inability to join the program now.ÊI seek your valuable advice urgently in this matter.
