Will I Ever Be A Normal Successful Member Of Society?Ê  dawn28 ,Ê14 Apr 2015I am having a hard night here. My anxiety is constant today, I am obsessing a lot today. I am just sitting here crying my eyes out wondering if I will EVERÊEVER be normal. I mean a normal everyday working person. I am 34 and stagnant, just feel like a hamster on a wheel. I have fleeting moments of joy,Êheck even some days are joyful but in the back of my mind I am always anxious. My anxiety is sucking the life out of me. I see my p.doc on the 28th. I have tried a lot of meds to no avail. I know I still have a lot I can choose from, though I am afraid to start new meds because they never work for me or they have horrible and I mean horrible side effects. I have a life, I cant go on some drug and go half nuts like I did once before. I am at a total loss. I think my husband hates me at this point, my poor child doesn't understand why momma cried sometimes, even my dog looks at me with sad eyes. I am driving everyone away from me. Please tell me things will get better some day? Its been bad for almost 6 years now, off and on of course but the last 2 have been brutal. My obsessions with family dying eat me alive, my worry about my future makes me feel like a total loser. I am an alcoholic on top of all this. I have been trying to quit for a couple months now and I am 3 days sober today. I was a binge drinker, like 3 days of no drinking and then drink a lot for one day then would not drink for 2 days or so and then drink a lot again. Is this messing with my head too? I belong to another forum and so many great people there tell me when I stop drinking that over time my anxiety will get better but I have a hard time believing anything anymore. I just want to go back to being a child and be happy again. I know my life is good but I cant seem to feel good.
