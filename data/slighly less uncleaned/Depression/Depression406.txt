Why Did You Go On Medication?Ê  TwentyTwo ,Ê04 May 2015After a really bad episode this weekend, I went to therapy today and had the conversation I've spent my whole life trying to avoid: time to go on antidepressants. I have reached a point where - even though I know I need to - I am still scared to go on medication. And ashamed. There were a lot of tears. I feel like I have failed on some level. That this is my last resort because nothing else has really worked. If you take meds for your depression, why did you decide to take them?
