Sick and TiredStarted by abbielaura16?, 10-03-15 08:39 PMHey guys. I am completely new to this but felt like I really needed to rant. I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and I'm currently on anti depressants. I'm alot better than I used to be. I moved in with my girlfriend at the other end of the country therefore am alot more independent. But lately things have gotten worse, like how they used to be. I'm feeling so unmotivated and down all of the time, I'm constantly exhausted and get bad head aches. My anxiety has gone down alot however I beat myself up over silly little things. I feel more alone than ever and are pushing people away. I never want to talk to anybody and find work a struggle. Just getting out of bed each morning is proving to be so difficult again. I'm getting myself in a rut just like before. Having somebody to talk to on here would be lovely! Sending lots of love to tou all. X
