 Diagnosed today  Blossom89, 3  Hi everyone, I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. I'm new here, today I was diagnosed by my GP with depression. I'm not sure how I feel. Part of me is releaved, I'm not a freak. And the other part of me is in shock, it doesn't feel real. Overall I'm glad though. Step one to recovery? It's been a dark few years for me. I just want to say hello. I'm looking forward to reading how others live with it and how to improve my mental health. I've only told my boyfriend so far, who wasn't particularly supportive. So another blow. Right, I'm done rambling. Hello all
