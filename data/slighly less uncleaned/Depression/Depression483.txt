Is It Really Depression?   tachem46032 , 07 Apr 2015How do you know if it's really clinical type depression, or just a feeling of being down or depressed because of a life situation?  My anti-depressant isn't doing a whole lot, at least it seems that way.  I am on Dilantin for epilepsy, so I have to be careful about what AD drugs they give me.  Right now I'm on Escitalopram.  But I'm still feeling it daily (the despair, the hopelessness, the sadness).How can I tell if this is just because of a poor life situation (poor choices) or just a situation like a breakup after a LONG term marriage?  Are there any medications that will help with the sadness of a major life change?  Or is this just something I have to wait out?
