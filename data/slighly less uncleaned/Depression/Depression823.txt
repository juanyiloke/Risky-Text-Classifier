I can't cryYesterday I found out that my cat went missing from my parents house 2 days ago and hasn't been seen since. He's and old cat and my parents think he has died. I wanted to cry but couldn't. I spent all day lying around my apartment trying to cry but I just cant.ÊI know I'm sad but I just feel empty. I cant feel anything, just tired and dead inside. I almost feel like I could hurt myself and I wouldn't feel pain, I would just recognize that I'm in pain and feel nothing. I have had depressed thoughts and feelings for 8 years but I have never been this way before. I have been having trouble bringing myself to care about things for a while now, but to not be able to cry at the loss of one of my longest friends and closest companions?That honestly scares me.
