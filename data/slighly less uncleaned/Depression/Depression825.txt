Everyone's tired of me, so am IEveryone's tired of me feeling sorry for myself, everyone's tired of me whining about how life doesn't make sense to me. The thing about it is so am I. The weird thing I have noticed is how comfortable misery can become. I know I create all my own problems, I just don't know how to stop. I try to keep up my friendships, but my former closest friends all now live at least 4 or 5 hours away. I just never know what to say when I talk to them, I can either lie and tell them I'm fine, or be the downer when I tell them how I really feel. I'm just tired of it, all of it.
