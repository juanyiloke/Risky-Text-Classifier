Tips for living with a diagnosis of depressionStarted by Clarita?, 28-03-15 06:23 PMHi,I was wondering if anyone could offer me some tips for living with a diagnosis of depression. I was originally diagnosed 17 years ago and have got better at managing it (e.g. early intervention -previously if I relapsed I used to be I'll for about 6 months, and now it's more like a month, which is good). However I struggle with the day to day, especially boundaries. I feel so limited - e.g. if I go to bed a couple of nights half an hour late in the week, I have a bad day on the weekend. Any tips (other than sticking to a rigid routine!)?I also struggle with balancing looking after myself and work, which is often a trigger. I need to work part-time, in not too stressful jobs (i.e. Not too senior) which is tricky financially. I'm lucky my family can afford to help but I feel guilty - I want to be more independent. My plan was to start a bit of freelance work on top of job, but I'm wondering if I have the stamina and will have time to keep a balance and look after myself. Does anyone else struggle with this?Sorry for the offload - any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Claire
