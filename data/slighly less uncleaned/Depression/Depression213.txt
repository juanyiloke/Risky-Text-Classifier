  Always Down  Jimmy123, 3  i had a very severe psychosis years back and never fully recovered from it. Ever since i am on a constant down. This has lead to me not being able to do anything, this includes working or having a normal social relationship with anyone. I feel disconnected all the time. I feel no love towards myself or other people. It's not the worst thing in the world but i do have suicidal thoughts and the thought of living like this, with no motivation, for the rest of my life makes me feel like sh*t. I just don't have the energy to do anything but at the same time i know i should do something or else i will never feel good again. Some type of help would be great from someone who has a similar problem. Someone who also has to deal with a long term depression. I'm pretty open and would be grateful if somebody out there could give me some tips on how to deal with it or actually recover, because of right now very few things have helped.thanks for your time
