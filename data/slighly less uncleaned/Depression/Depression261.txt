CPN informed SS!! Êmami5,Ê3  Last Monday night I overdosed on painkillers. Not a lot, just enough. Told my CPN about it on Tuesday. She wanted me to seek medical advise, I refused saying I was ok. I hadn't taken much. She then said that she'd have to inform SS because my children were in the house at the time. Can anyone tell me what can I expect from SS please? They have been out before to assess us, about 18 months - 2yrs ago. Nothing came of it then. Will it be worst now that I have actually overdosed? Not my first time doing it. I do it quite often, worse each time. Thank you xx
