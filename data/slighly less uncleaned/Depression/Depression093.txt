Emotional Freedom Technique ( EFT or tapping) or hypnotherapy - beneficial? Hi guys,ÊHave done some shorter stints of CBT/psychotherapy for depression and anxiety in the past Êwhich really helped at the time but never really found I got to "get to the root of my problem" Êand shift it permanently.ÊAt the moment, I am not overly depressed or anxious but I felt that perhaps some EFT or even hypnotherapy could help me deal with some underlying recurrent insecurities.Just a little apprehensive because of the lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this technique so I wondered if anyone has ever tried EFT or hypnotherapy and could advise/give a little insight into how effective/not effective they felt it was?ÊThanks,ÊAgirl x
