ÊDepression ruined my life. Êcolin1967,Ê2  Hi there everyone.Ive been like this for many years now, but being the usual type of guy who wouldnt admit to having a problem it all eventually caught up with me.I had it all, beautiful partner, beautiful daughter, brand new house, bmw car great paying job, holidays in the Caribean and because of my stupid male ego and not admitting to myself that i had depression i lost the lot.ÊMy partner couldnt take it anymore and left me. From there, it all went downhill, i was drinking whisky like water for months on end and smoking copius amounts of grass and also taking speed, trying basically to make my body give up on me, but as you see it didnt work. So called friends never came near me, i body swerved my family for months. It all came to a head one night when with a bottle of whisky and i intended to end it all. The next morning i admitted myself to hospital and it saved my life. That was 2 months ago and everyday is still a struggle but slowly im getting there. Ive kinda barred myself from seeing my daughter because i hate letting her see me like this. I get too emotional when i see her and break down in tears. The next step in getting better is getting a job, but i cant even get an interview for one the now. This maybe read like a car crash of a post, but all i want to say to the men out there, get help as soon as possible for your illness and dont end up like me with nothing left. I lovve my partner so much but it looks like its all too late to save what we had. Thanks
