ÊDepression is strong this time! ÊJoey56,Ê1 Week AgoI'm kinda new here. I found this wonderful place because of my depression. I'm 59 years old, and have been suffering with depression for a while now. I usually hike and climb mountains to get my mind in a better place. It's always worked in the past, but not anymore. I also suffer with chronic pain from a car accident and see a pain management doctor every month for it. He keeps my pain level low, but I'm still in a low level of pain 24/7. (I've been in his care for 6 years or so.)For the past week or two, I'm experiencing depression like never before. I'm so down that I don't know what to do. I haven't told my wife, kids or anyone! I'm at the point where I feel it might be better not being alive. I would never even think of killing myself, but if I were dead, all my pain and depression would be gone. I'm just so confused. I have faith in the Lord. I keep asking Him to help me. I've never felt like death would be best before. And again, I would never kill myself, but.....I'm just so down.Ê
