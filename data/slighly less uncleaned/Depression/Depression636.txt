Been a while. *triggers*Started by Janelle?, 01-04-15 07:34 PMHey everyone, Its been a while since I posted here, but this has been the one place that I guess I have felt safest to post whats been going on with me. Anyplace else or anyone else I try to talk to it just seems to go unheard.. or it causes drama that I don't need or want.Things haven't been going so well for me lately, I just can't seem to pull out of this funk I am in lately, I have been off my meds again since Dec. All I really want to do any more is sleep or bite myself. If I feel physical pain that I put on myself, it seems to distract me from everything else at least temporarily. I just don't know what to do... I can't get the help I so desperately need because I don't have medical. Everything and everyone seems to irritate and me off. I am just so tired... Tired of everything. Tired of hurting all the time, tired of feeling sick all the time, tired of not being able to be happy. Even the small things that use to make me smile I can't seem to find joy in anymore. Honestly, I am not sure how much longer I can go on like this...
