I have been suffering with depression for 5 years I have recently had a severe bout of depression brought on by my wifes decision to end our 12year marriage.I have what i believe come out of it and on the path to recovery. All I can say to other sufferers try and be positive and keep up with the medication. I only realised how long my depression was going on for the other day and during all that time i thought I was no use to any one. Today I finished with my counselling and will need more if the NHS will help. I am a lucky person as i have had alot of support, trouble is with my depression i did not trust people thought everything was a conspiracy and it felt so real. I am through that now and hope to rebuild my life again with the help of my family and friends.
