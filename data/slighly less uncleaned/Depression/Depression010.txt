How do I move on   nicholas58526I split up with my ex a few weeks ago but cant get him off my mind, I wanted to tell him how I felt about it all ( i wasn't perfect but he didnt help me much either) I got the courage to tell him and he told me to go f*** myself. Fair enough that pretty much proved that not being with him is a brilliant move. But I cant stop thinking that someone I thought loved me could say something like that to me. Did he even ever care about me? how do I just forget about him and move on?
