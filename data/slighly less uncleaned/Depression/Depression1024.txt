Depression is what it is xI've been struggling for years with the famous black dog...it is what it is !I've been challenged to the death...literally, trust me, I've looked that in the eye and it has almost consumed me many times.  I have received much love in the dark hour and know many who have offered love and hope and I do that too now I shine more in the light...The Light! I hope we all find this bright space of love and bask in its warmth and I hope I will always have open warm arms to those struggling in the dark x.I too dip into the dark from time to time and its because of those who survive in the goodness of life that I find a safe space to rise.I'm posting this because I'm grateful in so many ways but want to say that even though things are better, it takes strength, belief and a helping hand from this space and people around me to keep my head above water.Sending love to those who are struggling, lets rise to live another 'good' dayYour friend in this struggle x
