Finding a partner when you have depression?I am 23 yrs old, so have a life ahead of me and wonder if any of you ladies have found a partner who genuinely cares for you and accepts your depression as something that is not your fault and that you need occasional empathy and special care for?  While I have been very reluctant to define depression as 'a part of who I am' during the nearly 1 yr in which I've been seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, a recent panic attack and sadness about memories from my childhood when I thought I was truly 'over depression' and moving forward with my life has made me think that maybe depression will be a theme in the rest of my life.I was previously in a 3 yr relationship with a man who I thought loved me but turned out to have lied to me since the beginning and called me 'crazy' for exhibiting behavior that he thought was strange when I was going through a lot of sadness about remembering painful memories and wonder if any man will accept me and the sadness I have about my past.
