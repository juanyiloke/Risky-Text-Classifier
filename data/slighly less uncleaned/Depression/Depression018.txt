Fed Up For the last few months my ex sim determined to see nothing positive from me seeing the kids. I have a Mediateor and a Child Mediator telling me the kids want to see me. And an ex wife that can only run me down and tell the kids dont want to talk to me crtitises me for everything including moving out of the ex marital home that she got all the funds from in the sale.Today she pushed me to far and I explained that I am confused I have people saying the kids want to see me and her saying not so.It seems she is hell bent on ruin my relationship with my kids.James
