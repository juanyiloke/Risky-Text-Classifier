Depression came back and I'm lostHi, I'm a young academic who is trying to fight depression on my own. I've fought this before in high school and never thought it would come back for another tournament. I know the signs and they scare me. I'm too ashamed to tell my fiance. My work is slowly crushing me and I am continually thinking that I've made my parter sad or mad when I haven't and he isn't. I go from super excited to downright miserable all in a day. It's a cycle I don't know how to get out from. I don't have many friends where I live and none I can really talk to. I hope by posting here there might be someone who's in the same situation as me or has been and could give me some insight into how to Start climbing back out of the ring.
