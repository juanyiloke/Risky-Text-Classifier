How Will My Therapist Respond To This? (Possible Trigger)Ê  lp44 ,Ê20 Apr 2015I have mentioned having suicidal thoughts to my therapist before.Ê I followed that up with what I do believe to be true.... that I would never actually follow through.ÊI told her that I pretty much have narrowed it down to only three people for reasons why IÊ could never.Ê That's down to just two now.ÊÊI'll just say for the sake of where I am posting this that those thoughts are worse now, although I still contend that I sure hope I would not follow through.ÊPart of me needs to say this all out loud to her... along with a couple of comments I don't want to say here for the sake of it being bad for anyone that might read this.Ê I just need to say them to someone because it scares me a lot right now.ÊÊHowever, I don't know how she will respond to me.Ê I don't want her to freak out or anything.Ê That would SO only exacerbate everything exponentially. ÊÊI feel pretty sure this is due to some things that are surfacing in T that I really don't know how to handle.Ê I have also had a very long string of stressors in the last 6 months or so. Its like everything is coming to a head.ÊI don't have a plan... nothing like that... but this kind of intensity is new to me.Ê I know things have to likely get worse before they get better in T but geez.ÊÊHow will she react to this?
