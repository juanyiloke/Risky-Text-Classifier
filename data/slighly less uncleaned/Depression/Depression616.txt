hello , new todayStarted by cathy?, 26-04-15 07:40 PMHello everyone I am new today.I am a 57 year old mother and grandmother from UK.I would like to ask a question , I am not very computer savvy so hope I am in the right place on forum and it is om to ask about medication.I have been on Paroxetine 20mg a day for around 15 years to treat clinical depression. I am currently coming off Paroxetine to change over to Trazadone.Paroxetine works very well for my depression but is causing my severe restless legs syndrome to worsen.Trazadone is the only antidepressant in UK recognised by the RLS Neurologists not to aggravate RLS.My GP has agreed to the changeover and is changing me over slowly .So for thelast 4 weeks instead of taking 20mg of Paroxetine each day I have been told to take 20mg /10mg alternate days.Then I will have 2 weeks on just 10mg a day , then start adding in low dose Trazadone and so on over 3 months until finally off Paroxetine altogether and on full dose Trazadone.Right so on Tuesday I will have been on my lower dose of Paroxetine for 4 weeks and due to see my GP.I am worried because already my depression is back, cried basically non stop this last week , cant eat etc.How will I cope just on 10mg? Does anyone have any experience of changing from Paroxetine to Trazadone? If imfeel like this already how will I manage on only 10mg until Trazadone gets introduced. Is this worth it? Is Trazadone a good antidepressant? Sorry this is long and bit muddled!Cant believe just dropping 10mg alternate days has hit me so hard, haven't felt so low in years, Thankyou in advance for any replies ...Cathy
