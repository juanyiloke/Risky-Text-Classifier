Do you think I could have depression? i have been feeling down and not been my self for a few months now, but it seems to be getting worse. I don't see my friends anymore and I can't consentrate when I'm in school or even when I'm just watching TV. I've also been playing football for years and it always been something I've enjoyed but now I never want to go and I'd rather just sleep all day and do nothing. When I'm at school I either do no work at all and just can't concentrate or I do lots of work and don't stop till I have done it all. I get lots of bad headaches but the only last 5-10 minutes then go and come back soon after.ÊId like to know what you guys think and what I need to do.
