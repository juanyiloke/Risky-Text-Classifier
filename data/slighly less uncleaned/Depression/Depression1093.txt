Big Black HoleHi there, I'm new to the forums. ÊI have been battling depression for the past few months after a health scare. ÊNow I'm finding that a lot of issues from my past have cropped up and I'm having to deal with my grief from a broken marriage 10 years ago. ÊThis is really hard for my as I've lived alone quite successfully for the past 10 years. ÊI am getting professional help etc, but some days it's really hard going. ÊI have a good family and good friends who support me, but at times I feel totally alone in this. ÊMy greatest thing is battling my stomach depression which wakes me up in the morning, it's like a gigantic knot in my stomach. ÊI do breathing exercises and try to relax, but the only real way of releasing the knot is to cry, and then that can last for quite a while. ÊNow to top it off, I,m having songs and music stuck in my head. ÊAm I going crazy????? ÊAny suggestions would be great. ÊI'm 65 years old and didn't think I'd have to walk this road again.
