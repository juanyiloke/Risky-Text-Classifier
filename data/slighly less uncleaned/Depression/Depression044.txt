Feeling suicidal, is there any point to life? Whats the point in living? When you know youre going to be like you are for ever, when medication does not help, only makes you even duller and dumber so you cant actually question your existence because your brain is frozen, when you see every day as the same as the last, when you predict what will happen tomorrow, when you think of your future, imagine yourself getting a degree,Ê married, getting old, buying house, dying... youve lived it all in your head, why do you have to live it out in the real world? Ive lived life, Ive married my favourite woman in my mind, had children, done everything, I know how everything will pan out, if not exactly then at least generally... so whats the point in going on? If you can tell me, without waffle, without questions, just one sentence or two, and only if you know the answer to this unsolveable dilemma.
