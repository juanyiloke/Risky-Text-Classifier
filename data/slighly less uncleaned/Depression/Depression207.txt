  Having a really bad day  NorthernGirl, 13 Hours Ago 12I am sat at my desk in work, eyes welling up with tears, feeling so unbelievably low and depressed today, I have not had a relapse like this in a very long time. My friends do not seem to understand how I feel. I am a 33 single, childless woman, I work hard, I am independent and yet this terrible mental illness smothers me every day. I feel like I am a failure, all I want is to be happy and be in a loving relationship. Everywhere I look in work, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram people my age are happy, having babies, engaged, married and I have been single for three long painful years, I go on dates, but men only seem to be after one thing and when they find out I am not that kind of girl I simply do not hear off them. All of my friends are in relationships and I just feel like giving up. If it was not for my beloved rescue Yorkie I think I would. I know that being single is not the end of the world but it gets so lonely. Had so much bad luck recently, my father had a heart attack last week and I have simply reached the end of what I can deal with......how do you all cope? I cannot handle these thoughts................................
