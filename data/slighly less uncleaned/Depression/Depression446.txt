Your TownÊ  vega57 ,Ê28 Apr 2015Don't know if it's the correct place to post this or even if it's of interest to anyone but I thought this would be fun. I was born at home like most people in my era and home town. It was a very small town on the coast of South East Texas. No stop lights, one small theater. Oil and agricultural were kings along with high school football. The town of my youth was also very small but smack in the desert. It was a Mayberry type of town, mom and pop stores only. You could take your bike and get a flat tire fixed for free but when the mall opened in the West side of downtown it killed it. Than a way bigger mall opened two towns away and that killed our mall. I didn't realize how nice of a town we had till I grew up. The town is now a ghost town, most businesses shuttered or moved away. And no matter what is tried it just won't come back.
