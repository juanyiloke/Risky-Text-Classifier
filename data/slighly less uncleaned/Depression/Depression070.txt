Unsure of what to do?? Hi I am really unsure where to turn or what to do etc - last year I had a very stressful situation in my life and took some time of work - every now and then I get really low in mood and become quite tearful etc - over the past few days I'm just feeling really low and "useless" I find myself taking every little comment so personally and getting myself into such a state, I feel so helpless and wonder why I am here - when I look at my life and my age I just feel like "is this it" this is what my life is going to be like forever? I never have any money and constantly have to borrow tonight I found myself considering hurting myself just so I could feel something if that makes sense - is this depression? Or am I just feeling sorry for myself? I am so confused....
