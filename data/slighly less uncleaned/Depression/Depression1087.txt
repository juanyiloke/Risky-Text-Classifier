NewbieHi...I'm reaching out in the hope of finding some online support. I'm a 47 yr old sole parent of 2 daughters aged 16 & 21. Last year I had a manic episode and was hospitalised for 3 weeks. The low that followed left me feeling suicidal...these thoughts now seem to be subsiding. I'm on medication . I have tried others but but had to go off it due to it effecting my kidneys. Would like to make some online friends for mutual support...
