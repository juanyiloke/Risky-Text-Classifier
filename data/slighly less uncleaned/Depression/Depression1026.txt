Rebuild life after depression ? isolation ?Hi, for those of you who are reading this, did anyone have the experience of recovering from depression?I had a depression a year ago when i was in university, i made a wrong decision and studying something i don't like and i decided to change to study something that i really enjoying. However i suffer the consequences of depression because i think that i am not worthy due to my failure and wrong decision i made in the past. I began to isolate myself from other people, i thought it was a way of coping with my depression (I am depressed in front of other people and this sort of spoiling the mood of people around me ) . At the end, i realized that avoiding social interaction with other people is a terrible mistake and it only makes the situation worst.Now i have trouble in controlling my emotion and shy to talk to other people during the social event. I felt very awkward whenever  i  have to interact with other people. Something just feels not right and i think i have to do something to end this cycle, so here i am using my courage to post this thread. Does anyone have any ideas or experiences that can share with me on how you overcome self-isolation that cause by depression ? Or any suggestion? Because i am totally lost and don't know what to do at the moment.Thank you for your time to read this post.
