Anxiety then depressionHey peepsfirst time post.i got anxiety from being different im quiet and don't like attention even positive.i was outgoing over driven with things that I would do eg.if I had some sort of vision I would make it happen full stop.in my mind I can do anything.im a builder/carpenter and also have built race cars.skate surf weekly.have been sponcerd in the past.I was hit by a lot of judgment to the point where I would get anxious.people(workers) would watch me work because of the pace and the enthusiasm I had.i watched them try to as they say get in people's heads(mindgames)I seen groups of people target people on these work sites.after putting up with this for years it slowly broke my confidence and I would get anxious at work.to the point where anxiety had set in solid.i left that job any was hit with the same thing at another job(new)I went in with a unsettled mind tense serious.i quit that job as the bullying got very bad.anxiety made me slowly stop doing what I like.because being judged had been woven into my thought pattern.then came depression i have been fighting this by myself for 8 months it's been the hardest thing I've ever done.my partner is not very supportive.i tryed explaining but there was no getting threw.i also lost my licence so I was home bound all summer 6 months was very hard.ive never taken meds and never stopped fighting it.never stopped working and try my hardest to stay active.its been very hard but I'm getting threw it.i told childhood friends and they also didn't understand telling surrounding friends(saying I'm loosing it)I also tried to tell a friend I work with and it was spread threw my new job.witch made me feel betrayed.and even worse.coming to the end of this I'm starting not to care but I don't want to be to Mutch of a a$$hole finding the happy medium.keep fighting it I've found my character is taking a change but the old character was a victim.that was by far hell I'm still not full recoved.but never give up and adapt.i feel for people that have to go threw this.get well people.love you all
