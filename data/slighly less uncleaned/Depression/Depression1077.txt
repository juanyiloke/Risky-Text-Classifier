I thought my depression was gone but now i'm not to sureA few years ago my mum passed away suddenly and it left me in a state of shock, anxiety and depression. For a year I was really mentally unwell, no motivation, lost my orientation, couldn't do daily tasks, numb to the world and very very sad. I then practiced meditation and mindfulness, this gave me the strength to atleast live a normal life but i still felt imbalanced, so i was medicated. It was the help i needed. I was on the medication for a year and then felt like i was ready to come off them. I was able to live off them happily. It has been a year since ive taken them or suspected i needed them. But recently I have moved away from my family and friends and don't know anyone except for my boyfriend. I have made new friends but they aren't like my ones at home. I now spend most of the day alone and find myself thinking too deeply into life, i find myself not having motivation, i find myself sometimes just wanting to cry. I called a help line because i really needed someone to talk to, i asked her if i should take my medication again and she said that its a decision i should make myself. i decided that i should, but when i tried to find them they are lost. now i have a little anxiety knowing that i dont have my medication there for the 'just incase' times. I'm not sure if i am depressed because i feel like a smoldering flame of sadness rather than the blazing fire of sadness i felt before. But i do know i don't feel happy most days. I'm not sure if its homesickness and loneliness, lack of familiarity and support or if i'm just mentally weak and can't handle life as easily as others seem to. I'm not sure what to do. i do feel like my mind isn't chemically balanced because i don't feel chemically balanced. Can anyone offer any advice? I don't have anyone to talk to about it that will understand.Ê
