struggling to keep it together for my childrenHi, I'm 31 years old with 2 children. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year ago and prescribed medication, which I don't think is working because I have too many ups and downs, especially at the moment. I worry how much it is affecting my children, they have seen too many of my tears. Any other parents out there going through the same? There is so much I want to do with them but this awful illness is holding me back.
