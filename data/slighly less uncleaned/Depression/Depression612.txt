 Trying againStarted by Zeppelin?, 04-08-13 04:41 PMHi all, I'm back for another go.In real need of support/reassurance right now.I have been back to the dr now, have been back on anti-depressants for a little over 3 weeks now. I'm not convinced so far, and really don't feel great. Have been told these are supposed to take effect within ten days though, as I say I'm not convinced yet.I was due to go back in 3/4 weeks but think I'm going to call Mon and get next available apt, I need something more.Struggling really badly at work right now. And things at home are not good either, Mum's just been told her chemo is not working, options are running out now. One of my grandparents has just been diagnosed with cancer too. Today I had a call from the girl I'd been seeing for the last couple of months to say she doesn't think we should go out anymore, she has her own issues to sort out.I'm want to see if I can get something other than medication of dr, because medication on it's own just isn't going to do it. The anxiety needs sorting out, had the worst attack of it on Sat eve at a concert in London, really unpleasant and I have no idea what triggered it.Sorry thins is a bit rambly, my brains really not working too well and I'm so tired.
