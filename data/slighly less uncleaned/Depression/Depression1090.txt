Should i really be depressed?Hello.Im 25yrs old and seemed to have my life together about a year ago. However things crumbled slowly. ÊMy mum took a bad turn and attempted suicide. ÊShe has been suffering from depression and anxiety for years and lately its been at its worse. Sometimes She wont leave the house and lays around being depressed. ÊIt affects because i have to live with it. ÊLast year i left my job of five years and since then i still havnt found a suitable job or even know what i want to do. I feel like i am now becoming depressed because i cant find a job. ÊI keep putting guilt on myself for not having a new job. ÊShould i really be like this?Ê
