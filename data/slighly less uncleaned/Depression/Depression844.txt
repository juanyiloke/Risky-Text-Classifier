Looking for ideas about what is wrong with me...I have been going to a therapist and a doctor who specializes in psychiatric medications for a while now. I was diagnosed as depressed, but i have tried 2 different antidepressants and i'm still having problems. While my anxiety has gotten better i still have issues with the following:*my inability to concentrate*it's hard for me to accomplish anything*feeling like a failure as a mother, worker, and girlfriend*everyday i feel like i haven't slept in days when i sleep7-10 hours a night depending on when my son goes tobed and when he wakes upno matter how many times i bring it up they say it's the depression. Is there something else i should have them look into?
