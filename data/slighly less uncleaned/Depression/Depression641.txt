World without youStarted by Samantha340?, 15-11-14 09:47 AM It's one of those days where I just can't shake of those dark shadows. I just imagined a world without me and nothing would have been changed. Lots of people say they feel like a burden to others but I don't have this feeling. I have friends, who I know like me and would be sad, but still I feel I don't matter. I know its just a phase which will pass, its just hard to cope with this feeling right now. I know I am not alone with this, but right now knowing that does not really help.
