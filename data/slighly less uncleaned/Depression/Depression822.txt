Cymbalta causing hives?I was on Cymbalta for over a year and loved it. My career turned around, my pains went away and I never felt better in my life.A month ago, I started getting hives that went away by taking Atarax. My doctor suggested to stop taking Cymbalta and we tried Celexa but that just made me feel like a zombie. I have tried a bunch of other AD medication since then but have been depressed. Nothing works like Cymbalta for me and that too just after a single dose. I tried Cymbalta again today and I am again breaking out with hives. How is it making me break out when I successfully took it for one full year with no such problem? It seems like a common side effect at least on the Internet.
