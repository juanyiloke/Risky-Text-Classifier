I don't know how to keep going.I'm on the verge of giving up.. With college and just everything I'm general. All I want to do is stay in bed and sleep and just do nothing. I'm so tired and exhausted, it's killing me.ÊI'm on medication for anxiety but instead of helping the anxiety it's just aggravated my depression (which was close to none existent before the medication).ÊI'm close to being kicked out of college because of my attendance and I missed yesterday and I'm considering skipping today because even getting out of bed and getting dressed wore me out. I'm sat on my floor in a ball because I just don't want to move or do anything. I'm scared for my future, I don't want to be like this, I want to go to college and do well but the thought of leaving my house makes me want to cry and just crawl back into bed. I'm trying to make up for it by doing whatever work I can but it's hard without any materials from my teachers.ÊI don't know what to do anymore..
