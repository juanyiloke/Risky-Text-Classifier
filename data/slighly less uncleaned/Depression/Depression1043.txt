new, numb, powerless but hopefulHi,I'm new to this site but i thought i would give it a try. I have been diagnosed with depression for a month or so now and started some medication but i don't feel like it is working and want to know if there is anything i can do by myself rather than going to a professional. I don't like the idea of going to a psychologist as they are just getting paid to listen to my problems, which i don't think are worthy of sharing. I am numb. Emotionless. Or really sad 90% of the time. I struggle to get out of bed and i have increased thoughts of self harm, yet don't want anyone to see or know so prevent myself. I am constantly putting up a facade to my friends and family because i don't want them to see me as weak, hopeless or powerless. I don't want their pity. I need to help myself so i don't need to tell my family to be able to go to a psychologist. Please helpThanks
