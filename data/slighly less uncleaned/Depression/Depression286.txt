ÊOn My knees ÊTincy,Ê3  I've been suffering from Depression since February due to work, I hate my Job.ÊI was begining to have a better outlook on life but my girlfriend and best friend of 4 years decided she didn't love me anymore and walked out on 15th March, I then went into melt down, I started drinking heavily and still am, then on Mothers Day I decided I had nothing left and took an overdose.I've been getting back on my feet, been back at work 3 weeks, but I'm starting to sink back into the feeling of feeling hopeless and have nowhere to turn. I love her so much and can't get her out of my head.I just want this pain to end.
