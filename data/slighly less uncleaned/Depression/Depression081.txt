Anyone been misdiagnosed Bipolar?? Been battling Depression for over 10 years and have been treated for depression and anxiety with Anti Depressants for the last 3 years.I haven't worked for the last 2 years and have always wanted an official diagnosis as I believe I suffer from OCD and elements of PTSD from traumatic events in my life, as well as depression and anxiety.The Psychiatrist I've seen recently said he agreed with my Psychologist's diagnosis of Dysthymia with Major Depression and Severe Anxiety. Yet when, after many weeks of asking I received a written diagnosis, he had put "F3130 Bipolar Affective Disorder - Current Episode Moderate Depression without Somatic Syndrome".This diagnosis affected me significantly for the worse as I started researching Bipolar and was v.v.confused that after all these years this is the condition I had, apparently.Over the course of speaking with someone close to me and going on what I've been told previously I believe that the diagnosis is wrong and feel that it's very unprofessional to give someone in a very vulnerable position a potentially life changing diagnosis via letter without ever discussing Bipolar in person.Interested to hear if anyone else has been misdiagnosed?Thanks
