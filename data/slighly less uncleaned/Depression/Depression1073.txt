Why do I still feel so lost and alone when I have a loving partner and family and friends who support me?I am in my mid 30's I have had anxiety since primary school and depression since high school, I have a husband, family and friends who love and support me but still I feel so lost and alone. I have no motivation to do anything. I sleep eat and go to work like a zombie, Êmy hubby has depression also so I try not to worry him with my issues. I am mostly depressed about my money situation debts bills, I hate my job, ÊI worry about not ever being able to have kids. Mostly I just want to feel normal and have the energy to be active and make the most of life but instead I just feel miserable 90% of the time :-(
