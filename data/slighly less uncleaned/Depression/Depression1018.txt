Family divided over my depressionHey, I've been hanging round the site for quite some time before I finally got the idea to join up.So I've been dealing with depression on and off for quite some time. It's been about 11 years worth of struggling really and the cycle only just started happening again. I used to be alright in masking it but it's now starting to be a strain on myself and the family in that I never relate myself to the family and vice versa.I do have decent friends that I've been around with. However, they have been talking about work and other things which I've been uncomfortable around so I've left them for that. The reason is that I don't have a job and I can't really relate to their complaints thus far.I've seen different councillors on and off but I've never really conquered depression thus far. I think that's enough to start off with and I might see how this goes
