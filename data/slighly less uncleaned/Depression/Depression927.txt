ÊLetting Y'all Know I'm Still AliveHey guys! I'm still alive. Lol. So I'm taking Wellbutrin and it's not helping anymore. I think in the beginning I felt better because of a placebo effect. I see the doctor May 5th. I wrote him like 10 pages about my life, feelings, and EVERYTHING. I did it where he will know everything about me for a proper diagnosis. Right now I'm not sure of my diagnosis. I'm not otherwise specified until he knows me better. I feel nervous about giving him the letter because it's embarrassing because it about everything and I'm scared he will think I'm weird.
