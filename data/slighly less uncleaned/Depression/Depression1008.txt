Anna Banana Sick of the constant struggle.7 May 2015I haven't posted before but felt the need to today.  I'm just so tired of the constant struggle to keep on top of this illness called depression.   I'm in my 40s and it feels as though it's getting worse with age.   I hardly ever leave the house, and I don't want to.  I don't want people to see me like this.   My husband has PTSD and although he's very supportive, I don't want to burden him with my issues.   Some days it's hard to see the point of it all.  My anti-depressants don't seem to be working very well lately. I am just so totally over it all and wish this black dog would just go away. But I know it never will, and that's the hard part.   I don't even want to talk about it with anyone as I can't see the point.   I'm not sure why I'm even writing this!
