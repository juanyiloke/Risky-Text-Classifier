Looks Like That Time Is Coming....Ê  Lumessence ,Ê23 Apr 2015For the past 4-5 years, I've been only struggling internallly with my own pain and seclusion. But today, my step-father called me out on my uselessness by saying that he works and I don't.ÊIt's been peaceful here in my own home, and that is really the only thing that has supported me all this time. Aside from my family here, I have no one to depend on for my own needs. If this becomes an issue, there's no way out. I cannot exist in a place where people do not accept my inability to be as efficient as them. ÊI have enough pain as it is, I don't need to be constantly reminded and shoved into the dirt about how useless I am on top of it. I don't know what to do, and I am legitimately concerned that my future is waning thin, because I would legitimately rather bleed out than have to deal with this.
