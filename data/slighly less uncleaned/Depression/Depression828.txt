I feel like I want to die, feel so lostI've been married since 2001. It's not been good for several years now but I stay for my 2 kids. I almost left a couple of years ago, but my parents took her side because they were scared it would effect them seeing my kids. I knew then that im alone. My own parents chose Her over me.Had another typical back and forth and decided I'm done. I want a divorce. spent the day with my kiDs and it felt like I was saying goodbye. They are in bed, im up alone feeling lost. I'm tired, lost, and alone
