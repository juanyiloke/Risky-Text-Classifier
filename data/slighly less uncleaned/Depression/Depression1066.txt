I don't want to seem like a sook or like I'm looking for attentionOk, so I think I have depression and I don't know what to do next. It only really hit me recently when a friend made a comment and when I actually did some research I think I might have depression. Problem is I don't want to speak to anyone I know about it I don't want to seem like a sook or like I'm looking for attention-also the reason I don't want to see a doctor because I am scared they will say nothing is wrong with me and I'll never feel better. Im 24 and I have become so withdrawn. I used to be quite bubbly and outgoing but now I don't want any attention on me ( it's so bad I avoid pulling up directly beside cars because I don't want anyone to look at me). I am not excited about anything anymore and I can't see any future for myself and I am always so tired. To try and describe it I feel as though I'm stuck in a tiny frosted glass box, everything outside is blurry and everyone outside the box is going about their lives in fast forward and can't see me in there and have forgotten me. I feel like everyone is always annoyed with me. I've lost all my confidence I avoid eye contact with people and I just feel like it will never get better. Strangely though I get weird bursts of happiness/energy for about an hour at a time and then crash again. I don't feel connected to anyone anymore. My best friends/family feel like strangers.ÊI want some honest opinions - do you think this is depression or just a phase? I've felt like this for about two months now and it just seems to be getting worse. ÊÊThanks - sorry for the long post
