Did You Accomplish Anything Today? Anything At All? If So, Post Here!Ê  dsm ,Ê11 Dec 2013Today I had to go to the store, and that's a very big task for me for so many reasons. One, I hate to leave the house. Two, I hate myself. Three, I'm obese and it's a huge struggle for me to move around.Ê Four, I suffer from severe anxiety.Ê Five... and so on.ÊWhen I have to go to the store, I make myself sick over it for days.Ê Today, I told myself that if I made it to the store, I would come and post my success here and maybe someone would understand just how big a deal it was that I got that task done.Ê And even though I don't know anyone here, I was anxious to be able to tell someone, anyone, that I accomplished my task.ÊI went to the store today!Ê Not just one store, but two stores.Ê I'm exhausted and stressed to the max, but I did it.ÊIf you did anything today, anything at all... please post here.Ê Or if you do something tomorrow, please come back and report it.Ê I don't care how small the task is, because I think when suffering from depression, there are no small tasks.Ê I have days where if I take in the mail, it's considered a good day.Ê Seriously.ÊÊSo, did you do anything at all today?Ê Anything?Ê
