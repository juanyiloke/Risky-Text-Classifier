Pushing someone awayStarted by L1234?, 26-01-15 05:23 PMI met my ex boyfriend over a year ago and to begin with we had the most amazing relationship, I genuinely thought I had met my soul mate. However 6 months later I moved away to uni for my final year and from then on things just get worse. I have been diagnosed with depression which I think has been triggered by a number of things but it runs in my family and childhood experiences haven't helped. I opened up to my patent about how I was feeling and he never really tried to help he would just tell me to "chill out" or "relax"Which is very hard for someone who thinks like me. Then I started over thinking every little aspect of our relationship to the point where I would have a go at him for not replying to my text within 5 minutes. Obviously he has recently ended the relationship with me and now I'm left to deal with my depression and the fact I have ruined one of the best relationships I could ever have and it feels unbearable and I don't know how to cope. I'm sure a lot of you can relate to this, it's so painful and horrible I just feel completely lost
