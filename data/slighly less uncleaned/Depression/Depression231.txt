 Mood swings are driving me crazy!  en3011, 1 Week AgoRecently I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with everything. I'm having really bad mood swings, one day I’m so angry to the point I end up breaking things or just snapping at everyone that speaks to me, the next I’m crying all day and then some other days I’m really hyper and I never know why I’m in that mood, nothing normally sets it off and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to get out of it. I’ve been feeling like this for about 4/5 months now and it’s just getting worse.I'm 20 and about 18 months ago someone assaulted me and since then I have lost everything.I lost my job because I couldn’t face going into work after it happened and now I can’t seem to find another job. I tried going back so many times and I only managed to get to the car park and then I panicked and had to go home. I lost all my friends because they weren't supportive and felt like they didn't care, my relationship with my dad is pretty much non-existent, he lives about an hour away and ignores my texts and calls, my relationship with my mum isn't great either. All I have is my boyfriend who I love so much, but I feel like he deserves someone better.Every time I try to speak to anyone about how I’m feeling, they just seem to shrug it off as hormones and say 'You're a girl, it's normal' or they start telling me how their life is worse than mine which doesn’t help at all. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore because I’m really struggling.
