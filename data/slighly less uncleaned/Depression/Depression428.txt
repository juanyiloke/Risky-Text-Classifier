Don't Know How To CopeÊ  alice000 ,Ê28 Feb 2015Can someone message me? I don't know how to start talking on things like this. Not back at crisis point yet but I need help please, at home I just feel like I am a house elf and I'm not allowed to talk about my depression or to ask for any support because my other 1/2 always makes me feel guilty for needing help, and then he tells me that I always turn things around onto me and my needs whenever he does something to break my trust or go behind my back. I love him, we are getting married in November, although whenever I get down or stressed out he tells me to forget the wedding and call it all off between us. Just want to talk to someone who might listen.....
