Found An Answer/leaving Df/off Meds!Ê  sloTJ ,Ê01 May 2015Hello everybody, I'm leaving this forum because I've finally found something that is adding to a few of my health problems. I just found I have something called pyroluria or pyrolle disorder. It's very common with people that have mental health problems. Such as depression/depersonalization/major anxiety/schizophrenia/ADHD... I happened to stumble across this urine test which I'm so glad I took. I am still struggling with major depression and extreme anxiety along with memory problems for the past few years now. I have started treatment of pyrolle and since go off of Prozac completely. I'm still very sick but this has made a difference for me so I'm sticking it out. I will still be looking further into possible Lyme disease, allergies, and other nutrition problems. Please look into pyrolle if you're struggling because it could help you more than you'd think. I hope I can help even just one person here by posting this. You will improve.
