Bipolar DiagnosisHiLast year I had a manic episode with psychotic features. I ended up in hospital for 3 weeks. I have been experiencing a low since roughly July last year...no pleasure in past activities, lack of motivation, little energy, etc This week I went to see my psych and asked him straight out what was wrong with me. He told me I had bipolar 1. He adjusted my meds which I hope works. My episode was triggered by long term high stress. Has anyone else been diagnosed with bipolar?
