Topic:Êseverely Depressed and Confused...ÊCancelFor most of my life, i have battled with depression and anxiety. I also have ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder) and have just learnt that i fit into the "category" of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) < after="" finding="" this="" out,="" it="" has="" answered="" a="" lot="" of="" un="" answered="" questions="" and="" now="" kind="" of="" makes="" a="" little="" sense.="" lately="" ,="" i="" have="" been="" feeling="" more="" depressed="" than="" i="" have="" ever="" felt="" in="" my="" life.="" i="" feel="" sad,="" scared,="" alone="" and="" very="" confused="" and="" i="" am="" not="" entirely="" sure="" why?="" it="" just="" hit="" me="" like="" a="" ton="" of="" bricks!="" i="" have="" been="" seeing="" the="" same="" doctor="" for="" over="" 15="" years,="" so="" she="" knows="" me="" very="" well.="" i="" am="" in="" the="" process="" of="" getting="" some="" counseling="" and="" am="" starting="" on="" anti-depressants="">I have lost my passion for everything and have no drive what so ever. I find it really hard to even get out of bed - but i force myself to do so.... Even my housemates have noticed a change in me, they can see im not my normal self and now i am wondering who and what my normal self is... ?i know that keeping yourself busy and exercise can really assist with depression, along with routine. Currently , i find myself hiding in my room and not doing much of anything .... I don't want to speak to or see anybody. I don't like it when my phone rings , so it is off most of the time.. Gahhhh really need to try harder !
