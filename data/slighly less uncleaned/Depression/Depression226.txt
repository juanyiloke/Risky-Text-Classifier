  It's been a while  Very tired, 4   123...4Since I was here. Not sure what I'm here for. Having one of those weeks, need some help or something but don't know what.I've made a real mess of everything. Been trying really hard last month or 2. Back to work 3-4days a week the last few weeks. It takes everything I have to organise work and go and do it (self employed). I've not done much outside work as I feel so drained. Everything's a right mess. Maxed my overdraft and 1 credit card. Direct debits and things bouncing back. The van I drive for work isn't taxed, direct debit missed and I can't open my mail so probably stopped my insurance. My spare van had run out of MOT, as well as tax and insurance. I have 2 fines which I got a couple months ago (toll road) which would have been a few quid if I'd remembered to pay but now it's probably big fines. My driving licence is expired, and registered to the wrong address. I don't even know how to start sorting all that mess out.Things started going down hill, I don't know why. But Monday I started thinking about death again. Tuesday my CBT lady was hoping to call my doctor and change me citalopram to soemthing else. Monday I ran out of citalopram, and because I wastn sure if I was going to change I didn't get another prescription and so I've had Tuesday-today without. Can't say I feel any I'll effects of stopping yet but I'm sure I will. I just feel I've messed everything up and will never be able to sort it out.
