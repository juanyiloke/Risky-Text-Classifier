Depressed for about 10 years struggle to get I'm nearly 28, 90-95% of my life has been stressful and unhappy because I had a terrible home life. I left home for 19 to go to uni in a different city but stayed in touch with my parents cos I have brothers under 10. Things came to a head 3 years ago and I haven't spoken to my parents for 3 years. I got better for a while. It took me 6 years to get my degree, my brain has had enough, I'm constantly tired, my brain is slow, I have memory and concentration problems. I also have back pain on and off. My main problem now is that I'm fed up of never ending depression, I can't lose weight, I'm about 2/3 stone (20/30lbs heavier than I used to be. I can't work but struggle to get disability benefits. I'm so fed up, distraught and at the end of my tether.
