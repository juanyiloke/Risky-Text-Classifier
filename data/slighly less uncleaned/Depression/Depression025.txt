I have my own black dog and it may cost me my relationship Hi Everyone,For years I have struggled with emotions and feelings of being down, not good enough, even ending it all. Today I went to the doctor to seek help and have been referred for counselling.My boyfriend of just over a year has tried to help me time and time again, but I snap back at him. Now he's upset I went to the doctor without talking it through with him first and appears to be blaming himself for my depression.I tried counselling before but it didn't work. I'm hoping this new one will although I'll have to wait 4 weeks to see someone. The other counsellor I was told about by a friend.I think my relationship may die because of this. He's cut off from me. Slept on the sofa last night and is being snide all the time now, asking what he's meant to do and how can I just expect him to be ok and want to be normal around me.I feel like I'm a class A fruitloop. I could finally see I was hurting him, that's why I went to the doctor, now I feel I'm being punished for it. I'm sure it's the illness translating it all to that and I'm sure he isn't punishing me. But I really don't know what to do.Please help
