It's like looking from the outside in and it is not youI've been on and off this site that many times.Scared and nervous about what to say, here goes. There are times when I feel happy, but there is an enormous amount of times that I just don't feel right. ÊI can't concentrate on things, feel restless a lot of the Êtime, burst into tears at the slightest, and not know why. ÊI think not knowing why I have these feelings is the thing that worries me the most. ÊWhich just makes me feel even worse. ÊSometimes when I have been sitting with friends, everyone is laughing and having a good time. ÊI get the feeling of isolation. ÊI then Êput on a front that I'm enjoying what is going on. ÊIt's like looking from the outside in and it is not you. ÊIt's like being on a roller coaster. ÊI can exude confidence really well and hide the way I feel, but inside my stomach in churning. ÊMy father died back in 1995 and I have just neverI really felt the same. Here I am yet again looking for reasons/excuses for the way I feel. ÊI'm unsure of myself nearly all the time. I go through mood changes where I get this strong "not a problem" "whats the worst that can happen" attitude, a sort of high, then I go downhill fast and the wave of uncertainty comes back full on. I more times than not have a feeling of unsettled nerves. Small things that most people seem to just handle, set me off, making me so stressed that I cant eat, sleep and break out into cold sweats. Ê I'm scared for some reason of going to a GP, fear of what to say. ÊAny advise or help would be greatly appreciated
