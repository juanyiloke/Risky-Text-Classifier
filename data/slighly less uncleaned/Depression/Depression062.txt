OCD and Depression :( (My Life Story) I am 31 years old now! I used to be so Happy and motivated when I was at my early 20s. I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Banking And Finance at age 24 and offered a job in a bank abroad in Gulf area where for the first time in my life Panic attack and OCD hit me. It felt so strong that I could not work anymore and resigned in less than 1 month.My main obssession are intrusive thoughts that I keep ritualizing into my head until My brain feel so tired and my head feel lighted and drained off Êand so afraid. Afraid A lot! I feel so sad when I am in that situation especially that I feel I do not look my age (so much Younger) so I constantly feel that I want to make double effort so that people take me seriously. I worked at two banks thereafter where I worked for around 6 years. Now I am unemployed and feel so down and afraid if and I say if i found a job that my OCD and depression will oblige me to quit.I am taking prozac now again (been off it for a while now back). I am so down Can you please help me if someone Have Obsessions like me and I mean Pure O ( like I keep Checking a situation in my head especially work issues to make sure everything is right and under control) and what to do If i am so devestated of looking so young for my age? (I guess that is an obssession also).P.S Some days and I mean a lot I am afraid to go out of the house until my anxiety calm down. I am so smart and when I am in my normal mood people do like me but OCD and Depression ruined my life.
