My Fiancée Doesn't Care About My DepressionHi guys, It took a while to finally get this post together, but here it is.I've been feeling a bit worse than usual these days, so I figure it is time I should reach out to someone. Nobody in my life will believe I am depressed. This is probably because I hide it so well, with my sense of humour still being intact.Anyway, the reason I'm posting as you can see, is that I feel my fiancee doesn't seem to give a darn about my depression. In fact, it makes her mad at me.I have let her in and told her about the way I'm feeling before, but that doesnt seem to make a difference at all. Just so we are clear, I don't try to use depression as an excuse, and I don't even mention the word to her. I try my best to do things to make her happy, and all I get is crapped on for it. She will get mad at me for doing things too slowly, or screwing something up, and then she acts as if I am doing it on purpose.Like today, I was making her chicken parmesan, and I accidentally cooked one side a little bit burned when I was frying the breaded chicken. So as I expected, she chewed me out for it and said it was because I didn't care enough about anything other than myself. She has been under a lot of stress lately, but this kind of behaviour is really unnecessary. I don't treat her like that. We're a couple, we should be partners. Im tired of getting stomped on every time i make a mistake. She should be helping me heal, not hinder it.To get to the point, I want to know what I can do to pull myself out of this. I want to be happy again so I can make my fiancee happy. I love her very much, and I want to believe we can get through this. I just dont know what to do or what to say to her. I feel like anything I do is hopeless, and I'm just going to fail. The Depression Screening survey says I am severely depressed, but I just dont know what to believe anymore.Any tips you can give me for coping would be appreciated.
