Depression & Eating DisorderI have depression, anxiety and apparently dysthymia, then after reading the information for women I display every sign of having an eating disorder, apart from actually being anorexic. I'm actually feeling quite low now. Does anyone else suffer from an eating disorder? And willing to admit it,? Huh! That's the hardest part.
