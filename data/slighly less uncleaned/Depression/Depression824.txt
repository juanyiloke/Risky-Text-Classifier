100% depressedTomorrow I leave for a one week vacation. When it was planned I had a bit of hope. Today I could care less. I've felt like this for weeks. Physically drained, mentally depressed. Appetite is non-existent. Now that's an ironic plus.....I could stand to lose a few lbs. my vacation consists of returning to the scene of a major life change event 4 years ago. There will be sun, "fun", dining. But my wife is concerned I just might relapse. I think so too. Especially if I start remberung some of the sordid details from 4 years ago. Details that I've blocked from my memory. Fun wow ??!!
