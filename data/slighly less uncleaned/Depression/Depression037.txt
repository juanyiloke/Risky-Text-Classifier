Supporting and feeling helpless Hi,I hope this is the right place to post this if not I apologise. My husband has been having some difficulties for a while now but the last year it's been really bad. He can't seem to get excited about anything, family holidays, nights out etc. he constantly worries about everything - for example we ordered our son new boots for rugby training and he can't stop worrying if they will fit or if they will arrive in time. This is just one of many things he's constantly worrying about. My son is having a birthday party - it's all paid for and everytime we talk about it my husband literally can't handle it. I feel that I can't talk to him about problems in the house as I don't want to add to it but I'm struggling to have nobody to talk to. It's like all he does is worry - getting the kids ready for school and he's totally on a mission for a couple of hrs - like he can't relax.What can I do to help? Does this sound like anxiety? Depression? Both?Thanks so much for help in advance.
