Love You All You Are So Precious And Special :*)   desperados , Yesterday, 03:22 AMhaha we suffer and it's called ''real world'' when no one is really thinking and caring about anyone else at all. It's hard to be in depression around healty people they judge you and ignore you easily but here i feel like i'm a part of a big family with real people like you around Everyone fails in the real world but they act like they're super cool..That illness forces us to think that other people are better than use but in reality we are the real people in this fake world.We Live But We Dont' Know Why?   desperados , 10 Apr 2015It's boring as hell to be trapped into that flesh and bone structure called human body :P We fear death cause we don't know what's going to happen when we die For me we are the product of  the calculation of probabilities of the events that had randomly occured but life is so complex that it could not possibly have been produced by an evolutionary process. The repetitive nature of everyday life is not worth living cause no matter what you do you die at the end and not a peaceful death..70% probability of dying from old age or illness. so at the end it doesn't matter if you are happy or not cause life itself is an illusion of the brain
