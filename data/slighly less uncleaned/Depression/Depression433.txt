Things I Think About These Days - Seem To Remember From Cbt?Ê  psychocandy ,Ê02 May 2015Did CBT years ago and didnt find it much good.ÊRecently the way I've been thinking has been very weird and Im sure seems to match up with what CBT is all about. Trying very hard to remember this.Anyway, some examples of what I do sometimes:-Ê1) Wife went to visit nursery for our young daughter. We're short of money at the moment. She told me she'd registered but in my head she'd commited to it financially, had gone behind my back, we were going to argue, Êthen we'd split up over it. In the end, turned out she had just registered.Ê2) She might say something a bit off. I'll convince myself she hates me really, we're going to split up again. She might say one thing slightly off then all weekend Im just waiting for her to say the next thing that MIGHT be off.Ê3) I'm convinced all we do is argue and can remember in detail all the bad things, but can never remember good things.Ê4) In work, someone might say something, I'll be convinced they dont like me. Cant get the thought out of my head.Ê5) And worse one. I think back years and am convinced that at this time (several occasions) she must have been having an affair. It goes around and around in my head I cant let it go. More than once we've talked about it and shes absolutely given me no reason not to believe her but I tend not to remember these conversations. I just wish I could let it go - some of these times are like 20 years ago! Of course, confronting her about things like this AGAIN may cause REAL problems.ÊAny suggestions?
