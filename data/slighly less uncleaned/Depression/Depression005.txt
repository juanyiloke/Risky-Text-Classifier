time to put a stop to this life.  stephen7059I've been dealing with depression on and off now for most of my adult life and I finally have accepted the fact that things don't change when your in my position so have given up on everything and am putting my plan into action for the end of my life. I'm not here for pity as I simply don't care anymore as I've genuinely tried to change my circumstances for the better for years. There is no way out of my predicament, I have no education no job and no way to retrain for a new career at 36 with no money. I've not eaten for 2 days and will be homeless by November. I've had no idea of which route to take regarding future employment for sometime now as I can't stand knowing my life is going to be spent on minimum wage in some warehouse for the rest of my days and it's like a massive weight has been lifted knowing my time here on earth will soon be over. No more pain no more disappointment no more lies to friends that I'm fine, finally I'm in control and it feels great that this is nearly over. My advice to anyone reading this is do everything you can when your young to enjoy your life because when you reach my age the party is over. Good luck to you all ill see you on the other side.
