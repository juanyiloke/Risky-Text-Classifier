I feel like a book that's missing chaptersI don't know where to start, I don't know if I even suffer from depression or am just a little lost in life.I'm Stinson, I'm a 23 year old Caucasian male. I haven't had the best luck with employment, everytime I get a break get a job, it falls apart as soon as I get ahead, and I end up back to square one. It's like I can't move forward. I've been going through this for 4 years, and it's stressful.my relationship history is the only thing more sketchy than my working history, I've had 2 long term relationships, 1 mid term passionate, romantic relationship and then the spark of a pre relationship recently. All of which were unsuccessful and just end in me being hurt more than they are.Êso I'm sort of in a point in life where I don't know what to do, I think it would be easier to not wake up most mornings, and I think about dieing more often than not. I'm not capable of suicide, I couldn't do it, it scares me too much, but I do think it would be easier if I just stopped waking up one morning.Êso this is where I'm at, I don't know what's wrong with me, I just thought I'd reach out, because I'm at a point that I need someone but have no one.
