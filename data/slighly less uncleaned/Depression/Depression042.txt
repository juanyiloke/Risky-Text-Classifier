I have been depressed on and off for qbout 13 years But just in the last 2 or 3 it happens every 3 months or so. I am so fed up with it and tried a number of Antidepressants over the years. I am fegettingo the end of The line and don't feel I can go on like this. I have hit a brick wall and feel I cannot go on like this much longer. I wonder if over the years I have just damaged my brain with all the different meds. I feel desperate and yet have a wonderful family.
