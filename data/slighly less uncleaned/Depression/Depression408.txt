Think I Have Finally Lost My Mind. Advice Would Be Appreciated?Ê  CoffeeAddict103 ,ÊYesterday, 04:56 PMFor the past week or so my emotions have been all over the place. A mixture of anger, despair, frustration and extreme AGITATION. I have been tearing my hair out literally. Last night i did not sleep a wink. I have thought about suicide in the heat of the moment, i keep getting suicidal thoughts, how to execute it, how to not fuck it up etc. I'm not suicidal. I just don't know what to do. I'm unemployed 22 and living with my mum. When my apprenticeship ended nearly 2 months ago she was behind me and all of a sudden she is ignoring me being passive aggressive and hostile, she has not acknowledged my existence for the past 5 days. Even when she walks past me downstairs she wont even say a word. This is making me more stressed. I don't know what to do. I think i may have gone mad literally. I don't feel right. I feel so mixed up. Maybe ive finally gone psychotic? I want to cry. I want to inflict pain on myself ive never had these feelings before. I don't know what to do.Ê
