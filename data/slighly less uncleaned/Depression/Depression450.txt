Sleeping Or Locking Myself In A Dark Room Always Help MeÊ  depressedand ,Ê01 May 2015I think it helps me more than medication and therapy ever have. Yesterday I woke up feeling ok but it got worse as the day progressed. In the evening I was feeling really bad, Êhaving strong and VIVID suicidal thoughts. It was scary. I got to my room locked door and windows, shut out the lights, got it completely dark and listened to music to drown out outside noises. My mood immediately improved and I fell asleep. Woke up an hour ago feeling way better than yesterday (still depressed but not suicidal).ÊPeople often tell me that I must socialize but I think it is the root of the problem. I regret most of the socializing I ever did. And sometimes I NEED to be away from people and outside stimulus.
