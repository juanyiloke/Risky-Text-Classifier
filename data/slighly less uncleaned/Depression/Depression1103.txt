Help: Your thoughts and what you've done in the pastI have been told I had depression before, over 5 years ago. I never felt like it really went away.Tonight I feel like I have 'cracked'i feel like I am on the verge of crying all the time. My arms feel heavy. Breathing hurts. I want to tear all my hair out. Am I crazy? Have I lost it?ÊI feel like a failure. I will never amount to anything. Everything I try I fail at. I have no direction in my life and it's terrifying. I don't know what I want, or where I want to go, so I have no direction I feel like a failure.ÊI called my mother to talk it through and everything she said is true, I am capable of success. I guess my failure is my own fault, it my doing, I am the only one to blame.ÊHow can I stop feeling like this, it's so heavy it's crushing me. I can't see the end. I can't see the point of going on.ÊPlease, I just want to hear your stories of what you have done to give me hope.ÊThanks
