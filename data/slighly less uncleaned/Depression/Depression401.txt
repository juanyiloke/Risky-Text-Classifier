Hug BankÊ  Marie241 ,Ê26 Apr 2015I got this from another support site I am on.I've had wonderful support from posters on DF including many hugs. This bank is not to replace these spontaneous hugs, or individual requests for hugs during a post/thread.this thread is for people to deposit hugs so when anyone needs one, there is a store for them to withdraw from.Anyone can give a hug, and anyone can take a hug. Maybe you could deposit if you have a good day. You might want to withdraw one on a difficult day, either before or after posting, or on a day when you barely have energy to get online and can't post.All types of hugs can be deposited - bear hugs, gentle hugs, friendly hugs...ÊI now deposit five hugs to get the bank started.(To mods - if there is a similar thread you can delete this, also not sure whether depression central Is the correct forum so feel free to move it)Ê
