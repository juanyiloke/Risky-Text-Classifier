Êmaybe a trigger............ SEX Ênonotme,Ê08-02-15Ê123...8can anyone explain this to me? I have no idea what it is all about, never have done guess I never will do..I'm still as mixed up about it as I was nearly 40 years ago, I hate myself and my sexual self, I also hate my pathetic penis.No one would want me sexually so I don't have to worry about taking part but that doesn't stop my stupid thoughts. I wish they would go away now.I can't even look back and say I had fun, because I didn't. There's no way I willl ever have any sex again unless I pay for it.night of dreams about sex has really unsettled me. Feel like crying into my cold coffee right now, just need to write some of this down.I feel like a freak.Êhygiene Ênonotme,Ê15-01-15hey, I know this might be too personal and I'm sorry if it is, but how good or bad is your hygiene ?mine is very poor, I have no reason to be interested in my looks or appearance. I have not shaved in six months, not taken a bath since new years eve and its been over a week since i brushed my teeth.I just don't register to do these jobs, I do change my clothes every few days but it is every few days, maybe a week or more at times. My home is a mess and is also becoming unclean, the last time I washed up was two weeks ago.I know I should do these jobs more, and I know I'm not doing them I just can't be bothered to do them, no one else see's the mess so why bother ?Me.
