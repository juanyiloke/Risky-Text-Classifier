Êprobably depressed also adhd mostly lonely. please any advice would be awesome. Êthewellone,Ê2  Let me start by saying I need therapy but I cannot possibly afford it at this point. I'm 28yo male, married with 1 daughter 5yo. I really don't know how deep I should go into all of this don't want to push anyone with helpful info away with 1,000 words. Basically I'm almost positive I'm depressed, I was diagnosed with adhd 6 months ago and while the stimulants have helped me think clearer they do nothing for the lonely empty feeling of heartbreak I usually seem to carry around. Wife and I are essentially high school sweet hearts married now for 7yrs, I love her and my daughter more than anything I have ever loved. My wife is usually unhappy with me for some reason and she threatens to take my daughter and leave me by myself almost every time we argue. The feelings I get when she does this prevent me from accomplishing anything productive which only affects me and my family in a non positive way. My father passed away from cancer in 2009 at 42yo which I cant get over because I feel I was robbed of years of memories with him. His mother passed away a year later (also cancer), she raised me as her own from a baby till 10yo she was my image of a great mother growing up. I could go on forever but idk how much everyone on these forums can handle, just want someone to talk to.
