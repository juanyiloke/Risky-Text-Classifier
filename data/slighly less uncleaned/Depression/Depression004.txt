been started on sertraline 	ollie64hello, i talked to a GP for second time tuesday morning and he has put me on sertraline, i have never had these types of meds before and while collecting them chemist said that id feel worse for first few days or so, and took first one this morning and i see what she meant already, was very drowsy and tired and unfocused earlier, felt nausious too.ive had temazepam before a few times for pre op anxieties a few times which i found didnt really help, and the GP said sertraline has a wide range of effects and also helps with anxiety.and also how theyll take 4ish weeks to kick in.i didnt really want to start tablets but i know its the logical choice, he also offered councilling to talk with a professional but id find it very awkward and id feel it was a overkill.anyone else taking these have any info / exp ?thanks
