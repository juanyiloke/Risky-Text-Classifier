Very LostÊ  SFChristianGirl ,Ê14 Apr 2015Hi all.ÊI want to start off by saying, I'm sorry to everyone. ÊI haven't been on in I don't know how long. ÊI know it's not fair of me to just disappear on everyone.ÊI've been struggling a lot the last month or so. ÊMaybe longer. ÊI've honestly lost track of time. ÊI thought I was coming out of this depression only to be pulled back in again.ÊI've been trying to make progress in relationships in my life. ÊIt hasn't worked though. ÊAt least in part due to my trust issues. ÊI have this habit of leaving people before they can leave me first.ÊI'm still missing my ex-boyfriend like crazy. ÊIt's been 2 or 3 months now and it feels like the pain will never heal.ÊI dated another guy briefly, for a month, but I couldn't put my whole heart into the relationship, so I left. ÊIt hurt me to do it, but pretending hurt even more. ÊI had to just completely break ties with him. ÊIt hurt too much to stay in contact.ÊMy first ex and I are still in contact as good friends. ÊIt hurts a lot though, cause I still have feelings for him as a partner.ÊRight now, I'm trying to get on with day to day activities, but nothing feels normal. ÊI feel like I'm in a thick fog with no way to get out. ÊI feel like I need to cry, but I'm trying to avoid breaking down while I'm at work.ÊRight now I just... Ê ÊI feel like screaming for help, but nothing comes out.ÊWhen I get into depressed moods like this, I tend to withdraw. ÊI know it only makes things worse, but I don't know any other way to deal with it.ÊI guess that's all for now. ÊI just need support right now.ÊThanks everyone.ÊJJ
