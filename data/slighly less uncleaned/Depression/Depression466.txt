How To Get Motivated To Take A Shower.Ê  PeacePilgrim ,Ê14 Nov 2009I am really getting annoyed at how much mental (and physical) energy it seems to take me these days to get myself into the shower (I hate baths by the way, always felt like I was sitting in a warm bowl of soup, showers USED to energize me...those wonderful ions spraying around).I am lucky these days if I get into the shower once a week. I was struggling with it last night at apartment, and finally gave up when I realized I wouldn't have the energy to both take the shower AND drive myself back here to new house where I'm staying. So tonight I'm struggling again. The shower stall sits there, feet away, and everything is ready. "All" I have to do is get in, turn on the water and scrub. But lately, even when I get into the shower, 2 minutes later I want to quit and get out. Part of the problem is feeling isolated when I get in--and trapped. Partly it's the energy it does take; I have had some physical issues lately, so it does seem to wear me out a little. I'm not sure what the rest is, but it seems like a big commitment, and one I'm not willing to make, it seems. By the way, it usually takes me 15 to 20 minutes to shower--I've never understood people who can do it in 5 minutes (that's always been true; I really identified with Kramer on the one Seinfeld episode that dealt with this subject). I don't dawdle, it's just to soap and rinse takes me that amount of time. I have thought of turning up the radio loud so I have the company of music, but the largest part of me just doesn't want to do this. This used to be a "feel good" experience, what the heck has happened?Any suggestions for making it easier?Thanks, Peace
