Doctors advise. Its a joke... What a world we live in hey...Our daughter went to the doctors this morning, she has been suffering from extreme depression, and quite confussed in her manner, not eating, a history of Kidney issues and infections,late last year collapsed and spent a week in hospital, This she explained to the doctor.The only thing the doctor said was you are just a little tied and need to rest, my daughter asked the doc would it be ok to bring my mother in so she can explain more, doctors answer was NO i have other patients to see.It is quite obvious to us as parents our daughter has problems, where do we go from here ?.My wife and i are at out whits end, not knowing how to deal with our daughter or the surgery..Its all become to impossible...
