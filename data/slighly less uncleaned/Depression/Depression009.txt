One step forward and now ten steps back, please help?    time2talkI was raped 3 years ago, although he was arrested no charges were made due to it being my word against his. ÊI have battled daily trying to get my confidence and life back together, only a handful of people know what happened to me and I have made a new circle of friends that knew nothing about it as I didn't want people judging me or talking behind my back. ÊThis was until last night when I was out and someone I thought was beginning to become a good friend said he had been told not to be on his own with me because I'll cry rape. ÊI lost it, I'm so placid but commpletely lost my temper and made a complete fool of myself in public. ÊHow can I ever face the outside world again? ÊWill this ever leave me, I questioned if I would be better off dead last night but I will not do that, however I am a shadow of my former self and back to the person I was 3 years ago when it all happened. ÊI have been waiting 3 years for counselling through my doctors surgery as I cannot afford to pay for it myself, I have battled this alone and just as I was beginning to smile I hate myself again today.
