Daily Check In And Support Thread   budfox , Yesterday, 10:22 AMI watched an interview some years ago with a couple of old actors (I can't remember their names) who had both gone through a terrible bout of depression at the same time. They set a time every day (in the late evening) that they would phone each other, without fail. Both actors said it helped them tremendously. I really loved that idea, that no matter what else was going on or whether other people were around for support, they both knew that at the same time every day they would be speaking to their friend. It seemed very reassuring. So, if anybody is interested, I wanted to start a thread aiming to do the same thing. The only rule is that we check in every day, post updates and see how others in the thread are doing.
