Not wanting to get out of bedI've gotten into the worst habit of hitting the snooze button for an hour, till the exact last minute I have to get up and make it out the door to be somewhat on time for work.ÊI know it's the depression and just wanting to sleep but has anyone figured out a way to make getting up less troublesome. I'm in trouble at work for being late a few times so I really can't chance it but even so I wait till the last minute or even past that to get up and I don't really seem to care about the consequences.ÊAmazingI've been pretty much apathetic about everything in my life lately. It took me 6 months to dye my hair and it really needed it as I'm going grey. Tonight after work I decided I was going to get my haircut, I haven't cared much about my appearance in months so this was a change.ÊAfter I got my cut, I felt good for a change and decided as it was raining to go to the mall for dinner so I could park under the parking garage and not get soaked. I also thought I could pick up a new shirt or two which I did and then had dinner. Next to where I ate was a nail salon so I decided to pop in and get my nails done and also got my eyebrows done.ÊI feel so much better, I've even had a smile on my face, I don't know how long this will last but I'll take it!
