 Possible triggers to depressionStarted by UniversityStudent?, 22-01-15 04:24 PMFirst of all I would like to say if you have seen this before it is not that I am spamming. I am just aware that I posted about my studies later on last night and many users may have not seen it  I am desperate for people to complete my dissertation questionnaire for my third year at Liverpool Hope University. The study has been completely ethically approved and could lead to more information into three possible triggers of depression: Social support, stigma and quality of employment (People who take part therefore must be in work) I would be extremely grateful for anyone that could take part and would be happy to post the results when all info has been gathered  I am aware that depression is a sensitive subject and I do not expect any names or contact details for the questionnaires. However you can contact me if you wish..thank you everyone.
