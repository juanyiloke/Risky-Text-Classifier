Depression & Single ParenthoodSo i have a thousand reason to be depressed and i have a list of diagnosis. i have tried so many medications. But to add to it all i am a single parent not newly single but going on 5 years now.i don't have some one to help with the kids. i am their all and only. I don't get to stay in bed all day, i don't get to not make dinner or wash the clothes or clean the house. i don't get to not drive the kids to school even when i am suffering the side effects of a new anti depressant. i don't get to cry all the time. i don't get to lie on the floor in the fetal position when i suffer a panic attack. i don't get time to myself.I do get to force myself every day to get up, clean up, make meals, get the kids to school, help with homework, try to hold fake smiles and try as hard as i can not to resent my children for existing (and then hate myself for thinking that).ÊTrying to find a way out of depression is hard enough. trying to do it as a single parent of three kids is well feeling impossible.Please if you are a single parent suffering from depression say hello. i need to know I'm not alone in this struggle that there are others out there trying try find a way out of depression as a single parent.
