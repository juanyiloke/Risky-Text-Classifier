What Is Wrong With Peoples Ethics?!Ê  Fizzle ,Ê22 Apr 2015I don't get it. I don't think I ever will. It's hard to feel connected to a world that harbours so many with views I find offensive.ÊÊThe latest is the reaction to the Hatton Garden Heist. For those outside the UK you can search it if you wish. It has caused devastation for so many and yet its quite obvious that there is a sort of admiration there in peoples reactions.ÊÊAnd more emotive for me is peoples reaction to Top Gears firing of Jeremy Clarkson ( for a prolonged "unprovoked physical and verbal attack on a colleague) and the reaction of masses of people to that firing. Death threats, massive petitions demonstrations etc. Not just a few people but masses of people and over an extended period of time. Why? Because he was a good entertainer. So it seems that someone doing something well or gratifying peoples personal needs (watching television about cars for goodness sakes) is more important than protecting someone from unprovoked physical and verbal assault. The assault being severe enough to warrant a hospital visit. Now these people are attacking the victim. Lovely behaviour.ÊÊThis is all immediately in the wake of revelations of the likes of Jimmy Saville. Rolf Harris and more Êwho were allowed to do all sorts and were not held accountable just because of their celebrity. But that doesnt seem to have taught these people anything.ÊÊDo people really have this little respect and concern about others? I can only think it comes from a prioritising of self interest combined with a profound lack of empathy or care about others.ÊÊAnyway. It makes me want to go and live on a desert island.Ê
