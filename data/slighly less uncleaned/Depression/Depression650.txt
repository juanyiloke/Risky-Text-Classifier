Had a rubbish week or 2 *Triggers*Started by northantsgirl?, 16-03-15 06:15 PMI am signed off sick for 2 weeks as the stress of work was all getting too much again - 2 other colleagues have also been signed off for the same thing this week so I am hoping work start to take notice now!My normal wellbeing sessions have ended and I have been referred to an employment advisor as a lot of my issues relate to work, feeling bullied, the way work deal with things - Am seeing her on the 24thOn Friday i was telling my mum what i was going to say to the advisor and got told I am a  stirrer, then spoke to 2 of my good friends at work who both told me I should probably leave the cafe i work in rather than the bullies be dealt with - even though I have just done a training course to be the master barista..................That was the last straw i went upstairs got a razor and cut all my arm - no intention to do any real harm just wanted some relief from the mental painwent to the parents for the weekend as they nagged me, then plied me with drink which lead to me getting really upset againwent to the docs today, citalopram upped to 40mg , told if these dont work then a referral to a psychiatrist and given a number for a local charity who do counsellinghave added a trigger warning due to SH reference
