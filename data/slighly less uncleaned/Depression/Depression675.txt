Useless *possible triggers*Started by Chroniko?, 02-02-15 01:19 PM12 hours of sleep. That's half a day. No one should sleep that much, right?It's hard to know where to start, so if the following is a bit incoherent, it's just me trying to put words to feelings - apologies if it's a little confusing.I missed a lecture. How stupid of me. I had plenty of time to get up. It's not even an early morning one. I have no excuse.You know, there are soo many people who can't go to university. In fact, there are a lot of people who aren't even alive today. And I'm wasting my life away. You promised you wouldn't do this anymore. How many years have you had to get used to this 'illness'? And yet you're still lying there. You're not who I wanted to be at all. You're useless.Useless. Useless. Useless.I have no excuse. I can just here my parents in my head - "Don't you dare think you can stay at home and sleep until noon everyday." I don't want to. I really don't. I can't think beyond this though. I want to disappear. I don't want to disappoint anyone anymore. I don't want to explain why I haven't moved. They know why, but it doesn't stop it. No one takes literally hours to get out of bed - they would have done something productive with themselves by now. And here you are, day after day. Why do you even try?I can't cry. Medication does not let me cry easily. I honestly want to scratch my face until I bleed. Of course I won't do it, because there is no way I have the gall to do such a thing. People don't need to deal with that on top of everything. I just feel I deserve that.I'm sorry everyone if that was upsetting to hear. I'm safe, don't worry. I think I just needed to let it out a bit
