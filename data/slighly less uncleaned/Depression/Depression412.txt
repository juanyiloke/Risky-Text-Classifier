I Feel So AbandonedÊ  loveleigh ,Ê05 May 2015I feel so alone.ÊI have no close friends. Most friends I have had basically use whatever they can get from me and throw me away.ÊMy mother is all consumed in her drug and alcohol addiction to really care about anything that is going on with me. If I tell her I'm depressed, she tells me to take more medicine.ÊMy dad is kind of my only friend. However, he can't spend very much time helping me because he is constantly having to pick up after my drug addict brother and his addict wife. If I was to really tell him how I felt, how much I have been thinking that the world would be better off without me, he would probably lose it. I'm kind of the only "positive" person he has in his life. Or at least someone who isn't running my life straight into the ground.ÊI have a guy in my life, but I have no idea where he stands with me. He has come over when I've really needed someone, but other than that, he doesn't contact me.ÊNo one at work really cares about me. They pick at every little thing I do and treat me like an incompetent five year old.ÊÊI have been able to talk to my therapist about these things a little bit, but it doesn't help.ÊÊI'm sitting here at work with tears pouring down my face. I just want to go home.ÊWhat is the point anyway?
