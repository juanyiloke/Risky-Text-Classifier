Ashamed and Embarrassed Seeing a PsychiatristFor around 3years now I have been going through my latest bout of depression. I also have an Eating disorder and OCD routines I have to follow everyday. Three years ago I went to see a Psychiatrist and psychologist but I got to the point where I felt so ashamed that I didn't go back. Now 2months ago my partner made me go back to the doctor and I find myself back at a Psychiatrist. The problem I have is I have virtually no social contact because of social anxiety and when I see the Psychiatrist I feel she is judging me, thinking I'm a total failure and I'm a disgrace for wasting her time and not working. She tells me I've got to want to change but I feel I have no motivation to, if I could see a better life for myself I'd fight for it, but I just don't, i see virtually no future. I'm considering not going back to see her because of all these thoughts that she doesn't like me and is "angry" with me for having no motivation. Can anyone give me advice about this?
