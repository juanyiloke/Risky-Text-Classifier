Am I in depression denial or is this just a state of mind?For the last few years I have suspected that I have been suffering from depression. I feel like there is no purpose in life, I am constantly tired and lethargic, I cant concentrate on anything or make decisions. I feel kind of empty all the time, like even when I am doing fun and happy things I feel like I am only laughing and enjoying it as a front to fit into society. The only time I genuinely enjoy myself is when I am drunk.. Which I dont do often because I cant handle the hangover depression. If I had my way I would stay in bed forever. I have no motivation to do anything, ever. The funny thing is, I cant remember a time where I didnt feel like this, I just put it down to being introverted or ÊI think maybe this is a personality trait of pessimism rather than depression? I mean, its not like I cant feel happy, sometimes I do.. Doesnt depression mean U have an imbalance and physically cant feel happy ever?Êalthough all these are classic symptoms of depression, I cant bring myself to seek help for them. How do I know if this is actually depression or whether I have just created this situation in my mind as a way to justify my negative mind?ÊI dont trust talking to a GP, i went once and she read through the checklist of symptoms and said yep thats it.. But how do I kmow if my symptoms are real or if I have just fooled the doctor by what I think is the disgnosis?
