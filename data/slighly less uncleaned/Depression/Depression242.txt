ÊDepressed about coming back from holiday Êenglish rose,Ê1 Week AgoI'm going on holiday on Thursday to Cyprus (paid for by my mum, I'm broke), staying 10 nights, this holiday was booked nearly a year ago, but instead of feeling happy about having a holiday - I'm dreading being back at home with the holiday behind me & nothing to look forward to. I'm also finding it difficult to find the energy to do all the preparation - ie ironing clothes, doing something about my very hairy legs & so on; also I'm 'churned up' worrying that the trains will not be running properly on Thursday morning & I'll be late getting to the airport & thus miss my flight.
