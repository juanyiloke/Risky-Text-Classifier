LowFeeling extremely low today, thank goodness I am off to see my shrink this afternoon.Have been going along feeling not great but managing to get through the day.ÊMy resting rate as my shrink calls it.ÊYesterday I could feel myself going down and this morning I woke up feeling really low.Ê Yes I suffer from depression/anxiety/ptsd/gad but with the help of my shrink and a psychologist I am presently seeing on the mental health scheme, I get by.ÊToday is a shocker, feel like a heavy weight is squashing me and I don't know why.Ê Nothing unusual has happened that I can think of.Ê Saw my mum last weekend and I feel she is a bit more frail but I was aware of that.Don't know what is going on, don't like it, was feeling a slight glimmer of hope that one day I would feel better but today that has gone.Life shouldn't feel so hopeless.Feel like a freakThis week hasn't been too bad until today. Have been busy, my coping strategy. Friday spent most the day socialising, the depression/anxiety etc. sitting on my shoulder but I managed. Yesterday I spent all day doing craft and was pleased with the results.Today I was flat out getting up, felt tired, sleepy and flat as a tack. I went to a friends for lunch managing to keep it together and hiding how l was feeling. Now my stomach is in knots, feel teary and so down.Feel like a freak, can't hold it together. I just want to feel normal and don't ask me what normal is, l don't know any more.My depression etc. seems like it will never go away. I am in therapy but my hope of ever feeling better is almost nonexistent.Others get better. I'm the freak that doesn't.I want someone to tell me it will all go away but that will never happen.sorry guys l'm just over it all.
