considered attention seeking - escalates guiltI have differed clinical depression for 23+ yrs and every rpisode has pushed my husband firther away.I seem to blame him for all my failings when i get caught up in the blurred space between reality and depressed reality.I dont know how to bridgevthe gap that just keeps getting bigger!ÊHe says he loves me but stands back and watches me slide further into the black hole!ÊAny ideas?
