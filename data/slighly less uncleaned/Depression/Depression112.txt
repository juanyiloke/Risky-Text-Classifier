I have depression, but need help for my fiancée Hi, I'm hoping some people can help me out please. I haven't thought about using forums for support until now despite having depression for several years - probably all of my adult life (I'm 33 now).I finally saw my doctor a couple of years ago and initially had a couple of courses of CBT but my condition eventually got too bad for me to work last June. I attempted to go back around Christmas but lasted a couple of weeks before I realised it was a mistake. I have since been signed off sick and am in the process of being 'made redundant', ie they want rid of me but can't just fire me!This isn't the end of the world as far as I'm concerned as I didn't enjoy the job and it was a stress I don't need in my recovery. My treatment is advancing ok - I have a very understanding GP, am also under the care of a psychiatrist, am on medication (Venlafaxine 225mg currently), attend group therapy to raise my self esteem, attend acupuncture to help me sleep, have access to a coffee morning for other sufferers of depression, have started volunteering at an activity centre for adults with learning difficulties and have an appointment next month for a consultation for some further psychotherapy.That said, these things take time. I felt as bad last week as I did at my suicidal worst last year. Progress is slow.This was as much as my fiancée was able to take and she has since taken some time to move out of our house. We are both determined to make it work and hope to have a happy future together, but I am so focused on looking after myself I find it very hard to look out for her. Is anybody able to provide some advice to me? And is anybody in a similar position with a loved one who might be able to offer some advice I can pass onto her? She has been referred to a counselling service by her own GP but the wait is likely to be months.Thanks for taking the time to read this, hope to hear from you soon.
