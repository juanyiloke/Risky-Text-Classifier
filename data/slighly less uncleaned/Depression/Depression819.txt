destroyedlast night my wife told me she doesnt love me the same way she used to and she doesnt know if she will stay.im completely destroyed. i just started taking anti depressants for six weeks and i know ive changed. im not the same person i was because i just feel so low all the time and i hate myself because this isnt the person i should be. and my wife doesnt like the person im becomingi asked her if she will be here to support me through this and she said she didnt know.what if i dont get better. i know if i dont she will leave me. im trying desperately to find that person she fell in love with.i feel the same for her as i always have, i still get butterflies in my stomach when i see her, i smile when i know im coming home to her or shes coming home to me.i never thought i would ever hear her saying those words. it broke my heart.how can i help her love me the way she used to when i hate myself.
