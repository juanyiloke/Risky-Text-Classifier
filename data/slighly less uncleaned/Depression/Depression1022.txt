I have forgotten who I amIf I could, I would, roll up in a ball, let others just go about their lives and I would just give up.ÊI am fighting each day.Ê I feel it in my chest. I just don't care is my mantra. My boys are keeping me on a level, but that level is not exciting or buoyant for them.Ê I am seeing the Dr. I have a psych appointment in 2 weeks. Have told friends I am depressed.I hate it. I know there is no switch but if only there was. I would be flicking it to happy.As I was working full time with depression, I used to use work to cover it up, leaving work going straight home to bed.Ê Now I am a full time mum, I have noticed that not having to work has shown me how bad it actually is.Ê And how long the episodes go on for.Ê This time around 8 weeks. No joy.ÊIf it wasn't for the boys, if I wasn't seeing the Dr I would give up.Ê Roll up in that ball, check into hospital and just refuse to get well.Look I understand that is not an outlook that makes sense. It is how I am feeling.The Dr booked me to see a Psychiatrist but they wanted 130.00 for a 30 min appointment. What the hell are they going to glean from me in 30 mins?Ê What a crock, so I cancelled the appointment.I have been on anti depressants for many years, recently changing brands to see if would help the mood and the sleep - the I just want to sleep feelings.Ê 3 weeks on with the change and still I just don't care.Ê Trying to sleep as much as I can.Ê Feeling also like I need it.ECT - I am wondering if this is the cure for me? I am so over loosing humour, not wanting, not caring, avoiding, hating, hurting, thinking that if life is like this for the next 40 years, why oh why bother.I am not suicidal. I want to remember who I am, what I stand for and why it is so for me.Where is that easy fix or remedy?
