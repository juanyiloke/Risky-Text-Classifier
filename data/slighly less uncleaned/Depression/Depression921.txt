Very brief periods of depression for no reasonHello,At the moment I'm experiencing bouts of depression that only seem to last for 2-3 hours. They seem to come out of nowhere and they hit very very hard. My eyes start to tear up and I'm just overwhelmed with sadness. It can happen at any time, when I'm home alone watching TV or when I'm cuddling with my girlfriend, the situation I'm in really doesn't seem to matter.ÊI can't figure out why I'm having these emotions. My life is generally fine and when I don't feel depressed I can feel quite happy. I looked into ultra rapid cycling bipolar disorder but I don't think that's it since I don't seem to have periods of mania. I have been depressed in the past for about 6 months straight which was caused by me being addicted to weed and basicly wasting 2 years of my life because of it but that was a long time ago and I have come a long way since.Please help me out, I just need to get a grasp on what this is. It's killing me that I can't figure it out, I've been having these "episodes" for over a year and I just can't figure it out. At worst I have 1 or 2 every day but there's been weeks where I didn't have an episode at all.ÊThanks in advance,Comstible
