Not doing so good at the moment...So it's been a while. I was doing quite good. And then I felt it coming, slowly. Had the urge to cry earlier today. For no apparent reason. I warded off the tears. I hate crying when there's no 'real' reason. Now it's just 'bam'. Sorry, pain is taking over! Crying, sobbing. For what? At least I should have a reason to be so sad, in so much pain!? I just want to go away. Make it all stop! I'm so tired of this unexplained sadness that consumes me on every level.
