Don't know what to do Sorry, this is probably going to be a long post.I'm not sure if I'm depressed or not but just don't know what to do. ÊI would say my mood is naturally on the low side, I'm just not a naturally happy person. ÊMy mood seems to change all the time, I seem to have a couple of weeks which I would say my mood is my 'normal' which is just a bit flat, this is usually followed by a really bad week followed by a week where I feel really good and can get things done and enjoy life. ÊI just don't know how I should feel? I feel like I'm on a merry go round and don't know how to get off. ÊIn general (most of the time) I just can't motivate myself, feel constantly overwhelmed and just generally unable to cope with everyday life. ÊI feel detached from everything and just can't seem to enjoy anything. I find it diffult to concentrate on stuff and retain information.When I have my really bad week (which is this week) I consider Êgoing to see a doctor but just not sure what/if they can do for me. ÊWhen I'm having a good week I don't feel I need to go to the doctor but when I'm having a bad week I can't see the point. ÊThis has been going on for years now and I feel like I'm going round in circles and just not sure how to break the cycle. ÊI suffered with serious depression in my teens so I know I'm not that bad but because of this I'm not sure what is normal? IYSWIM? ÊMaybe being happy isn't normal?Sorry for rambling, not sure what help I want, just feeling confused and helpless.
