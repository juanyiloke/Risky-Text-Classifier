Panicking during relaxationStarted by Sarah76?, 27-03-15 04:51 PMHi sorry not been about things are a bit mad at the moment sad to sayAnyway I have always done relaxation deep breathing techniques when had a panic attack or felt anxious even just to relax a bit but lately I can't do it , I get to that stage when relaxing you let your shoulders drop down and I panic jump up and have to stop as can't breathe feel suffocating.Any ideas how to over come it as I need to relax I'm so tense right now can feel it in my back and shoulders Thanks
