ÊStruggling Êstuggling mum,Ê1 Week AgoHi everyone. I'm really struggling at the moment, and have joined this forum because I desperately need to vent without judgement.I've struggled with a kind of low-grade depression all my life, and suicidal thoughts along with that, although I always think of it as me being too cowardly to kill myself. In any case I have two children now, and they need me now, particularly the older one who has ASD, so I could never kill myself (and boy, does that make me feel trapped at times -- while I don't think suicide was ever really likely, I think those thoughts acted as a sort of safety net).Anyway, I've just learned that we have 30k of debt that my husband never told me about. We are otherwise in an ok place financially, but this has sent me reeling. I was doing okay, trying to stay positive, but then today I have had an argument with my mother, who stays with us on and off to help with my daughter. Our relationship is very difficult at times, I believe borderline-emotionally abusive, and at the heart of many of my problems (and yet sometimes I can't shake the niggling feeling that somehow I'm at fault). It relates to a dress I was wearing that she felt was too low-cut (it was just a summer dress. I wanted to wear a summer dress) and she refused to come out with me if I was wearing it. So I put a t-shirt on.I can't help thinking that maybe I should just subsume my personality, stop expecting better because everyone will just let me down over and over again, Accept abuse, because why not? What's the point in fighting it? I'm worthless, always have been. Might as well accept that life is just about survival and making sure your children are okay. (And that's why the ASD is such a f****r, because it will make my child's life harder. And ALL I ever wanted for them is that they will be, at the very least, happier than I am.)Sorry, I've rambled. I think I just wnted to rant. Thank you for reading
