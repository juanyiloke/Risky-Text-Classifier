No hope for a nerdy boyfriend.This is redundant, as I've already posted about my pathetic virginity/lack of a simple date, but I'm as distressed by it as I can possibly be. I have average standards. I want a nerdy, antisocial, smart guy. The male version of me. That's it! I can't even get guys like that to be interested in me. They all want supermodel types. I'm tired of being overlooked simply because I'm not a ten. I'm like a four and I'm being incredibly generous. Ugh. I hate this.
