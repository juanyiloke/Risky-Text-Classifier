  Advice on tiredness/fatigue  buttercup32, 1 Day AgoHi. I'm hoping someone has some advice they can give me.I'm struggling with the symptoms of depression. I have really bad fatigue and am no longer able to exercise. When I try, I feel like I'm made of lead and can barely move. I'm struggling to do my job because I need more rest. Worst of all, my colleagues have noticed and keep asking me what's up because I can't even function well enough to hold a conversation.Is there something I could do to eleviate this? I am on meds and already walk about during the day so I'm getting some exercise (around 10 thousand steps daily). The brain fog needs lifting  When I started my meds, they helped me sleep and I felt refreshed for about 4/5 days and now i've gone back to square one
