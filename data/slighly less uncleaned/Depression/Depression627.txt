Descending **tw**Started by BlackRabbitKHFC?, 11-04-15 11:44 PMIt's been a couple of weeks since my last post. Since I started taking tablets and going to counselling a year ago, things have gone... downhill. I started off getting better, but now I just don't see the point. Counselling isn't working, and I can't be bothered going through months of drugs trials during my first years in college. I've tried getting into new hobbies, travelling more, eating better food, drinking better things, playing sports, and none of its worked, even temporarily. I'm starting to feel like there's nothing I can do. I can't sleep, I can't think straight, I can't do things I used to be able to do. I feel like I'm a shame to others with depression, the ones who pull through and live fulfilling lives, because I'm close to giving up. The World is Burning **TW**Started by BlackRabbitKHFC?, 01-04-15 02:06 AMThe financial crash of 2007 highlighted the instability and lack of security of our current political and economic system here in the west. Things quickly began to deteriorate and fall apart, like a destructive flame burning away our hope of a better tomorrow. Consistently since we've been bombarded with news stories of protests, suicide, illness, famine and war, all five of which can be avoided by taking simple steps, so why aren't those steps being implemented? I can't answer that question, maybe someone can, but for as long as those five things continue, the world will never improve. We're all aware of what happened to Gary Speed, to Amy Winehouse, to Heath Ledger, to Robin Williams, sad moments for us all, yet since we've heard of terrorism like in Paris at the offices of Charlie Hebdo and in Syria. Disasters have occurred, like the recent plane crashes such as MH370, MH17, IAA8501, GermanWings 9525 (which was suicide). These are the big things. On a small scale, here in Dublin five homeless men have died in the past week of starvation and hypothermia, while the Fascist government leader Enda Kenny eats cake at an event celebrating... something (no seriously, look it up). We see the financial inequality gap widening, people barely able to survive on the amount they're being paid because of the inflation brought on by the EU's decision to weaken the Euro so that we could export more (gr8 idea guys it's working so well that a box of American pop tarts cost $15 here).I don't know why I get so down about these things, or whether or not other people even care about them. I see them as massive hurdles in my own life. I want to fight back. I can't just stand here and do nothing. I feel so angry and alone and I want to do something f**king crazy to make a point but after being diagnosed with depression last year and dropping out of school due to illness recently, there's barely anything I can do. I've thought about violent protest, or self-immolation to make a point, but what'd change? The world is already burning. Adding another body to the mix will just make the fire grow.
