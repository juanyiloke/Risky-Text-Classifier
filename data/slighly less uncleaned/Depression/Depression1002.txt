Topic:ÊWhite Picket FenceÊCancelNot sure where to start. Text book fantastic partner. 3 beautiful kids. Volunteer at the local sports club. I have the white picket fence. I thought that if I convinced myself long enough in the dream I would be fixed. Clock on clock off next day begins.My family is not very supportive. My sister points out on a regular basis how Im not good enough at anything and my brothers drain me with all their dramas. My folks are old school. Stuck in their ways and how we should be. Die by the sword of 'what will people think'. And I must keep up the charade. See Im the fix it girl. If there is a problem I fix it. If you need something, I do it. I solve it all.Hubby is everything you should want. He is loyal and honest and he loves me. Really loves me. And I love him. He knows somethings not right but I just cant let him in. Truth is I know he would be happier without me. I know what you will say but he would. He deserves so much more than I can give.ÊI have this huge part of me that I keep hidden away and I wont allow anyone to get near it ever. Its been for so long, I dont know what its like without it. If you come close I will run and if you love me I will hurt you until you hate me. I wont let her get hurt ever again. Noone will know. I have let others in before but they always leave. They dont look at you the same way when they know.I think, I will just keep busy. Take on more work. Focus on the kids. Fix everyone else and no-one will see. Play the white picket fence game. But im tired. I want to not be but I cant do that to my kids. So back to playing the white picket fence.It is what it is I guess?L
