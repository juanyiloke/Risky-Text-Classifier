does thinking about it mean you're depressed.Is everyone that thinks about suicide depressed?I don't feel depressed, more apathetic, but I think about it and the plans every day.I don't really talk about it in therapy because it is just so common for me to feel this way and I don't want to disappoint my T or pdoc who think I am doing better.ÊMaybe I am depressed, but don't know it because in the past I was SOO depressed, I could not function.Are there people who never think about it? and is it always a sign of depression?
