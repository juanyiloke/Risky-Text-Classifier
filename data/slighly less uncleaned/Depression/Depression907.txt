So sad and angry all the timeDo you ever feel so angry or sad because of everyone? And then it makes you even more angry and sad because you wonder why you feel that way? Nice house, good job, husband (who really is an okay guy even though I want to strangle him every other day), two beautiful, perfect, good-hearted children (who I lose patience with so quickly after a day of working with elementary kids), finances are in great shape, etc.ÊI have lost my happy. It seems like all of my smiles and laughs are fake. I cried rocking my 2 year old tonight because I was so sick of singing to kids all day long and I didn't want to sing to my own daughter, but I did anyway, cried through it because I felt guilty for feeling this way.I have plenty of family and friends, but none that I feel comfortable showing weakness and asking for help. It gets worse during a particular time of month. Has anyone experienced a hormonal imbalance that maybe made them feel this way? I want there to be a medical reason I feel like this because I shouldn't be feeling like this with the life I have. I even feel guilty complaining about it here because there are people here with real concerns/issues stemming from crisis, abuse, trauma, etc.ÊOverall, whatever rut I'm in, it hurts because I am missing out on my most important relationships. Feeling empty and lost. Would love to hear how you get your happy back!
