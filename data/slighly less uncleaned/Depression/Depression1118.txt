all this help but getting nowhereI have a great team of help who look after me. I have a case manager and a peer support worker, I am currently waiting for a new psychologist but that may come when the dbt group starts I am not sure on that one.I still feel iI am getting nowhere even with all this support I am also on medication. I feel all I have learnt is what I can and can not say due to there requirements. I feel I can not be honest about my latest plan, but yet I am still trying to get all this help. I am loosing hope and fast I want to see that this is worth all my time and energy I put in but it feels like it's all been worth nothing I just need some hope but I have lost all mine.......
