What exactly is an assessment?Started by loopyloo?, 24-04-15 07:52 PMHi everyone. I hope everyone is doing ok.I feel a bit silly posting this but I have an assessment with the Adult Mental Health Service this weekend and I am wondering if anyone knows what that involves? I know it takes about an hour and there is a 15 minute questionnaire but other than that I have no idea. I am getting a bit stressed about it (one of my issues is anxiety!) so I wondered if anyone had experienced a similar assessment? I am hoping they will review my meds for one thing....Fingers crossed. ....and thank youNot sure where to turn.Started by loopyloo?, 19-04-15 06:16 PMHi - I am a bit new to this but will try to keep things brief.I have had a history of depression for a few years now, on and off really. I would say over the last year things have become worse and last August I went to my GP feeling very low and scared. I have been on Citalopram since then, but had a relapse about a fortnight ago and have moved over to Sertraline. I feel rubbish. I am scared, my head hurts, I am jittery and I just don't feel right. I know that this is probably largely down to the meds, but it's scary. My gp also referred me to the Adult Mental Health Team and I have an appointment with them soon but I am not sure what to expect there. I'm also worried that I will bump into someone I know from work there - I'd rather not say what my job is but involves seeing a lot of families locally in a support role - so I am also feeling completely hypocritical that they are looking to me for help when I am in a complete mess myself. I haven't had any time off work (yet!)....but I am really struggling now and time off just is not an option.I don't know what I am expecting from this forum - and I hope it is ok to join - I just don't feel safe and I feel alone. Does anyone else understand this feeling?x
