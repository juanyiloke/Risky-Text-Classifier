Kiwi has moved to the Pilbara - suffering big time :(Nz born female - history of depression for...wow just worked that out ...9 years now. have been medicated on and off throughout that time. I have gained an excessive amount of weight after a personal tradgedy and am now even struggling to get out of bed due to my depression. My weight is getting me down I had been doing so well as I have had a PCOS diagnosis and need to lose weight for medical reasons but now the 'black dog' is taking on my life again. Have had history of health problems eg - tonsillectomy, gallbladder removed etc...lots of time spent in hospital and a lot of ongoing medical things.My fiancée works 4 days on 4 off but we are in a backward little town with nothing but a Woolworths. I am literally going insane. Everything else should be great as I am recently engaged, wedding to plan, not having to work (choosing to turn down work as my anxiety and depression continues to mount and I don't like confrontation. I miss having my family as a support network. Skype and phone call is ok but I have nothing really to say as how do you tell someone else what you are feeling when you don't even know yourself? Fiancee tries to understand but thinks he can fix things. I can't be 'fixed'. This is who I am. He is not doing anything wrong (except having me in this tiny remote town away from people I love) I'm making friends, good ones - but I somehow doubt any of them have or are battling the demons baying at my doorstep,  I could stay in bed for days. I could lay on the couch and stare at the wall. I'm not sad and crying - I am numb. And for most people the biggest misconseption is that depression is sadness. It's a whole lot more than that.i am on a slippery slope and I need to reach out but it's difficult as my life looks 'great' so I feel selfish for feeling this way. But all I want to do is either numb my pain further or escape the numbness.Oh God - what a terrible mess I am in.  R xo
