Extremely anxious about taking Fluoxetine!Posted over a year agoHi, I'm an 18 year old female and last year I was diagnosed with depression and also anxiety & panic disorder. I have tried many things such as CBT etc however nothing seemed to help and so my doctor had put me on propranolol. After a few weeks of taking this my anxiety did seem to decrease but unfortunately my depression just seemed to worsen, my doctor has now decided to prescribe me with Fluoxetine (same as prozac). I have read the leaflet the medication comes with and it seemed to scare me abit (I do understand that with every medication comes possible side effects but with suicidal thoughts being one is extremely frighting as I already suffer from this and dont want it to get worse). I also havent been told anything positive about taking this drug of people who are close to me. I was wondering if anyone who has taken this could share with me their experiences on it?Much appreciated!
