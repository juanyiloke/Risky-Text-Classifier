What's wrong with meHi. I'm new to the forum.i don't understand why I feel like I do! I'm on medication but still feeling so down. Crying all the time, tired and just not happy.ÊI should be happy I'm getting married in the next few months , going on an amazing holiday and planning a baby.ÊI booked myself into hospital at the beginning of the year and got myself help. It worked for a short period.it feels like everyone is against me
