Relationship, Child, Depression..Started by Bond?, 30-03-15 10:44 PMBasically to cut a long sorry short I have been overweight all my life being 22+ stone at my peak until I decided to change and managed to get down to 12 and a half stone. During this time I had my first real relationship and when it ended I found it hard to cope but eventually found someone else. Anyway for whatever reason I decided to have a child with her, a year later we are still together but I have gained 4 and half stone and have no social life whatsoever. I am at an all time low, I think after being unhappy for as long as I can remember due to lack of confidence and eventually salvaging my life before it was to late for it just to revert back to how it was before, only now there is a child involved and a girl who loves me but I do not love her. I want to leave but feel obligated to stay for both her and our baby but my health is suffering, I just don't know what to do any more.. I have been prescribed sertraline 50mg, which has helped but my daily life makes me so unhappy, at one point I managed to get my hands on 100mg tablets and was taking 300mg per day, I felt completely numb, even the birth of my child didn't faze me but at least I wasn't unhappy. Please help me..
