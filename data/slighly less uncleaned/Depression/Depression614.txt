losing the battle *triggers*Started by KellyB31?, 16-01-15 04:45 PMHey y'all. I haven't been around much lately. It seems I'm so exhausted from trying to survive, I don't have much energy left for anything. I miss all of you and do think of y'all often. As my title suggests, I honestly think I'm losing the battle. Work is more than I can handle and it seems one thing after another is popping up. For instance all last week I had a abscess tooth, and had it pulled yesterday. My feelings of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, never belonging they never go away. I know I need changes to improve my life, but honestly I don't think I'll ever have the strength to make those changes. I just wish the pain would end.Trigger warning added
