ÊTriggers, can you completely overcome them? Êskeptic,Ê3  There are certain things in my life that really get me down if i am unexpectedly reminded of them. i am talking about mistakes, failed relationships and the like. I have accepted these things as best i can, thought challenged and rationalised and i am at the point where i am pretty much over it, however stupid things trigger all of the emotion and cut straight through all of the positive thinking and thought challenging. It is like a flashback and my head fills with images and thoughts. Certain specific things do it. A waft of a certain perfume brings a mountain of memories, regrets, mistakes and insecurities about a failed relationship. it happens instantly and can really knock me for 6 until i snap myself out of it. Certain songs also do this and it is both frustrating and ridiculous how my mood just switches and i have to keep dealing with things that should have been put to bed years ago.ÊI used the relationship as an example but it also happens with other things, and sometimes random, or unrelated stuff will trigger a thought that has the same effect. I have learned to spot it happening and can turn the thoughts around but it still always leaves me feeling so low and emotional. If i was to purposely talk or think the about the same subjects it would not upset of faze me in the same way and i hate that my mood can be so fickle.Êwriting this has made me think that maybe i havent fully dealt with the issues that bother me, however i dont know how i could do any more on top of the thought challenging and acceptance and this only helps after i have had the thoughts.ÊCan anyone relate or have any advice please?
