hi new here Hi I have suffered from depression and anxiety for over 20 years and recently had to ask for help again so I go to the mental health team spend over an hour explaining everything feeling bad about myself and was then told that everything in the past is irrelevant and that my medication was irrelevant I'm feeling very upset by this point and worthless so I get angry and leave. Today I had a copy of the letter they sent to my doctor it said that I am not depressed nor do I suffer with anxiety and that in was hostile. As you can imagine I feel everything I've ever done is worthless and can't see any point in going on I feel empty and a fraud I self harm on a daily basis, what is the point of going when no believes me ?
