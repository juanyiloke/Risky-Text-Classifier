body dysmorphic or rather nose dysmorphiaStarted by seeboo2006?, 17-01-15 04:12 PMHello from a new memberLooking to get a little advice on something I am finding very distressing.I have a not very attractive nose and issues with it which I usually manage to control as I don't have to look at it. I suppose it links to other anxiety and depression issues.Recently my new partner of 12 months made a comment about it, not realising I had a serious complex about it. It has triggered behaviour in myself that is scaring me - taking hundreds of pictures of it a day. As I'm not a big selfie taker I never realised how bad it is, but now I do.I've told my partner I need a break but I haven't said why. I'm googling ugly noses for hours and not finding one as bad.Anyway my question is what shall I say to my partner? He deserves an explanation but I can't heap all this crazy on him.Some help on how to stop feeling sick about my nose until I can afford a nose job, maybe 2 years, would be helpful. I'm not a bad person I don't deserve to feel like this.Thank you.
