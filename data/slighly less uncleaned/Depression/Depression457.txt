Have You Encountered People Like This:Ê  Sickdog ,Ê27 Apr 2015I have some screwed up friends. ÊOne of them always blows off anything I consider important, or working on. ÊThen whenever they take on a pet project it seems like it's the most important thing in the world, stop the presses, and then they won't even answer their messages because i'm a distraction. ÊJust one example after another. ÊI'm inclined to believe that he trys to keep me down on purpose so I don't get ahead of him. ÊI haven't worked in years, but thinking back on it i've actually encountered this a lot. ÊProblem is, i've never been good at getting along with people for whatever reason and they seem to take advantage of it. ÊI just don't have any patience for MORONS and don't find it worth defending but since I don't I seem to get screwed a lot.ÊAnd then there are my alcoholic friends. ÊYou know, the ones that got 10,000 problems but yet want to get drunk and discuss all your problems and try to tell you everything you're doing wrong when they can't even walk a straight line.ÊThe ones that know absolutely nothing about a subject but are suddenly an expert on it as soon as you are involved in and all too happy to tell you what you're doing wrong.ÊI've come to the conclusion I don't need these people anymore and that they have seriously wasted a good portion of my life with their stupidity. ÊÊDon't take this the wrong way, I don't mind advice but these jerks seem to be like attached bloodsucking weights. ÊI took them all out of my phone over a week ago my lifes so screwed up right now I decided it was for the best. ÊI'd rather have no friends than whatever you would call these type of people and i'm not really sure what that word is right at the moment. ÊLoser leach jackasses?
