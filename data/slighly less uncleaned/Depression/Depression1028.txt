I have so many reasons to keep my chin up but I just can't, I wonder if there is hope?Hi, I am new here. And I am looking for advice please? I have seen so many counsellors over the years, I don't even remember all their names.I feel like I am unlucky, it is as if I feel the world is hunting me down and I can't escape it. Depression just lurks in the corners of me mind, haunting me.My mother refused to leave her abusive husband, who hurt her and myself for years. I had to end the relationship with her 2 months ago and I miss her so much. I feel as if I have abandoned her, and she had a son with this abusive man who I also feel I have abandoned.I have a deadly auto-immune disease waiting in my body waiting to strike up again. I have so many reasons to keep my chin up but I just can't, I wonder if there is hope?A better future?Does it get better?Will I be able to sleep without nightmares?Can my mind get better?I just got engaged in January and I wonder if I should delay the wedding or continue to see it through? Can I put this incredible man, now fiance through this? Will he be happy and content living with a morbid wife?So many people don't understand depression, and I am hoping that someone out there does. If so, do you have a hope to get you through?How do you get through the day, what motivates you to keep going?
