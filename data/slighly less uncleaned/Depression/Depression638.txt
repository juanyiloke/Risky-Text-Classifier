New to this. Looking for advice.*trigger warning**Started by whirlp0ol?, 29-03-15 08:48 PMHi everyone.Im just looking for advice on how I can at least figure out what is wrong with me and how to deal with it all.I am a family man with 3 great kids. I have a partner that does anything for me and couldn't love me more if she tried. Why do I feel like I want none of this? Why do I want to be by myself all the time away from everything. I constantly wish my partner would take my kids and move away from me as I feel like I am such a bad parent. Constantly shouting over absolutely nothing at all and never wanting to do anything with them. All I want to do is completely zone out from the world and drift away in my mind.I have thought about suicide many times in the past few years but more and more in recent months. I know this is not the best option but when I think about how little I give to this planet and how my kids wouldn't even notice I had gone then thats when I feel its the only option. I basically look at my life like thisI hate my jobI hate myselfI hate the way I treat my familyI hate being a dadI have living with my partnerand I have the fact I have achieved absolutely noting with my life. I am not close to any of my family and I would say im not very close to anyone. I tend to keep people at a distance for some strange reason.Well there is more but I think this is enough to at least make a startThanks for taking the time to read.
