ÊHate my life... Êtimechaser,Ê1 Week AgohiFirst post on here. Just signed up.Êbackground: 38, decently successful career, happy marriage, happy little one at home (6 months old boy). been feeling low quite often and getting weird thoughts in my head - thought was anxiety but therapist (been once) thinks it is more.ÊMy problem is my wife at the moment. I love her, but she doesn't even begin to comprehend that I might potentially - I am not saying I do - have a medical problem. Her solution is for me to quite moping around. She wants me to grow up I guess and stop being a sissy. She is short at the tiniest of things - at least that's what it feels like. And a lot of the time it is not because I have done something, it is simply because I have done it differently.I dont think I can expect her to be there for me - given a little baby to take care of, but how do I explain to her that her getting mad at me is not helping. Without making her upset...I generally dont think suicidal thoughts - more about running away from home when she screams, but last night I did think of attempting suicide. Scary, even though I thought it myself, made me hate myself in the morning.Any guidance?
