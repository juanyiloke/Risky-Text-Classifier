Heading back, I thinkLet's see..I have UC that is flaring, and my bf and I were planning on moving in together in Aug and he just lost his job. Now I'm kind of questioning the stability of my relationship with him. And my health isn't so great.Every spring I love to work outside..I just don't have it in my this yesr. I love being outside but I get home and just want to relax. Well, just do a lot of nothing. I force myself to do stuff just bc I have to. I don't get happy doing much of anything lately.I scheduled weekly meeting to start again with a new counselor on mon. My old one isn't there.
