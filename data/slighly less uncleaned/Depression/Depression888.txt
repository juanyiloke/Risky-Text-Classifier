Stigmatized at Work...I had to take FMLA leave at work. Been there 7 years and somehow got thru my last med change 3 years ago with just burning up my vacation days. Not this time around. I'm in the process of tapering off Parnate because after 4 years even MAOI in high dosage is failing. It's been Hell managing to hide my illness at work for 7 years, but the cats out of the bag now. God willing I can return in 12 weeks, but when I do everyone at work will brand me a freak because their ignorant. They will surely put 2 & 2 together when they see I've no physical injury. One other person at work years ago had to do the same as me and when she was out of the office everyone said awful things about her. I would stick up for her, but at my company one must be careful or be branded themselves. Plus I'm a man so the Lions at work will be sure to shred me apart. Strange... I always could sense this woman suffered my illness long before her leave. She would hide hers like I do, but only I could see it. Takes one to spot one I guess. 25 years and endless med failures. I've become so resistant to every class of known meds that I may have no option left except ECT. That really scares the Hell out of me. My Psych doc is great, but even he's sort of stuck on med options for me. Going back to ones that used to work has no response even years later so not sure what to try now. I feel out of options.
