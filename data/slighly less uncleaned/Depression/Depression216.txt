  What the hell is going on? HELP ME PLEASE!  puzzledlife, 1 Day AgoHi! This is going to get a bit wierd to read but I need help I'm a 22 years young man who is sick of his religion because my father cheated on my mother and is proud of his stupidity as its allowed in his religion. He kept doing this time and again and I was growing up with itI developed a hatred towards this community not only because of him but because of the people of this religion and their actions. Since childhood I wanted to convert and today I just can't stand this anymore. I don't allow myself to enjoy life or can't think of dating someone as the future is not possible until I leave this religion. I go mad thinking that how do I go and convert cuz my younger sisters studies will get affected as my father will abandon her after my decision. He is a very religious man and won't tolerate my decision but trust me I want to convert. I just can't accept this thing. I don't belong to these people and I'm ashamed to tell others my religion's name.This is bad! I'm going crazy! There are fights everyday at home and my mother wants everyone to stay together in the future which is impossible from my side. I'm not being a good son today! I'm being mean and my thoughts are killing me I need help! What is this? Will I be alright? Will I be able to convert someday?I started showing signs of depression since I was very young and my head aches a lot Over thinking is bad! I don't feel like meeting peopleI spend time alone I have found a new faith and I love itI want to convert asap! I feel I'm being a burden on everyone! I don't share my problems with anyoneAll my friends come to me for their problem solving and I help them but what about me?
