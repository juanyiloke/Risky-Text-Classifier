Meds//HELP.Hi there everyone! So for the past couple of years I have been on Paxil (60mg) and Lamictal. I started out on 25 mg of the Lamictal and over the past year and a half I have gone up to 125 mg. I just started the last 25 mg last night (was on 100 mg).ÊMy Pdoc and I decided to go up on dose because I have been feeling very depressed and out of it. My Pdoc said that after a week, if there is no improvement I should add Buspar into the mix.ÊNow here are my questions:Does this seem like a lot of medicine? (I have a very strange fear of O.D.ing.)Just in your opinions, will the rest of my life just constantly be going up on more and more medicine? It's getting tougher and tougher to afford all this and deal with it.Thank you for any answers!
