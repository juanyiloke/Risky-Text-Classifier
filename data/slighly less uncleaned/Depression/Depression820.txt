Depressed and AngryHaving a really hard time today, feeling so alone, and extremely angry at the fact that I have never had any help from my siblings (or anyone else) during the last 15 years of caring for parent(s) and their property. I am getting old, and it is a lot of work. I never get help or a break. Is 7 days a week for me, and to top it off I have a sick, disabled husband at home too. Not angry at my Dad (Mom has passed), angry at my siblings and others for never being there. Looks like no one cares, because you don't leave someone you care about with all the dirty work. Not only do I never get a break, it has ruined us financially and some things you never get back like time with my grand children and fun memories. We have zilch pretty much anymore. People wonder why I seem as if I am in a bad mood.....Wow.....Now I refuse to speak to my brother's, and others have hurt me something terrible. Is like we don't even exist over here, only remembered when the work needs done....Thanks for listening to my venting....
