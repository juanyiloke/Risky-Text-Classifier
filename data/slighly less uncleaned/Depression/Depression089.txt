I feel better and I don't feel better I was so desperate for any form of relief I think I just convinced myself that the medication were working immediately and now my anxiety is coming back. ÊIts been about 8 days since I started back on Cit. Its not as bad as when I just started but its there eating away at me. And the depression and it doesnt help that we've had a death in the family. I keep thinking about my mum being gone and life not working out the way I planned. I suppose it doesn't help that it was my mum's birthday I few days. The black dog won't leave me alone and it follows me everywhere. Especially when I go and I'm in bed and all I can think about is whats wrong in my life. Silent frustration I suppose thats how my anxiety comes out and I worry and worry and I'm sad. Its the constant push and pull between the two.ÊI miss the old me and its been so long since I've been that happy girl. I don't remember very much about how I was and I wonder if I'll every be that person. If everything is right in my world if I will feel like this and if I do then whats the point of life.I suppose I just needed to get that off my chest.
