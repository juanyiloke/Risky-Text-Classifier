I Am An *****...Ê  lostinlife85 ,Ê21 Apr 2015So my depression and schizo-affective disorder cause me to have poor judgement.Ê I have since found meds that almost completely irradicate my symptoms though but my past mistakes still haunt me.ÊÊI worked at a large automotive manufacturer (as an engineer) for a couple months.Ê I made several dumb mistakes had a generally bad attitude, and I sorta lost my temper on a coworker one day (over the phone and I thought I hung up the phone but I didn't, and muttered something I shouldn't have and she heard it...).Ê The same day I was fired.Ê I also browsed crazyboards.org and depression forums (and some other sites I should not have been visiting...again, poor judgement at the time) on my phone during work hours (I was bored out of my skull there because I had nothing to do and my personal smart phone had no reception there).Ê Well, I don't think I cleared my history and when I turned in my phone the day they fired me I know they saw my history on the phone.Ê SMH...all of this is very out of character for me but my mental illness was in full effect at the time.ÊÊLike 1.5 years went by until I finally landed another interview (at the same company, or all places).Ê Well, I know the manager that interviewed me knew who I worked for before and contacted her (before the interview, but after he scheduled the interview so he couldn't cancel it) and she badmouthed me (she really did not like me).Ê After the interview the manager sat me outside of the conference room while his and the HR person talked.Ê I heard almost everything they were saying.Ê The manager told me during the interview that if he doesn't hire me he would pass my resume over to another group.Ê Needless to say I did not get the job and I never heard anything back.ÊÊWell, I finally landed a job at a company that serves this same auto manufacturer (and I work on site at the auto manufacturer).Ê Well, it came up in the background check (after the made a final offer) that there was a "red flag" in my file and it nearly cost me the job.Ê Whatever that is supposed to mean.Ê Now I think there are rumors going around about my past experiences at this company among my current coworkers (since I think my boss is a gossip monger).Ê I told everyone I never worked at the company (they asked if I had experience working there since most people that work at this service company do) but I know they know I am lying and they know I was fired (and why I was fired, for that matter).Ê I walk around and hear people laughing and giggling at me, and whispering.Ê Also, the IT guy set up my computer and there was a problem setting my my account because I had a past ID with the company so he knows I haven't been telling the whole truth.ÊÊThe only reason I got the job was because I told the hiring manager during the interview that I worked for the company in the past and why I was let go so it wasn't an issue when it was discovered in the background check.ÊÊI just want to **** myself.Ê I can't live like this anymore.Ê I am so embarrassed.Ê Ever since I dropped out of grad school (because of a psychological bully in my research group) my life has fallen apart.Ê I don't even want to be in the automotive industry.Ê The job at the automotive company is the only job I have been fired from though.Ê
