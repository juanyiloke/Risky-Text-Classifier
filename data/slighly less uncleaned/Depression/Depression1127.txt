How did you first admit you needed help?Please note I have not been formally diagnosed with any mental Illness, this post is to determine whether I should seek professional help. In the past five weeks I have been experiencing some out of character behaviours that I believe may be the start of a mild depression. These are as follows: Completely random feelings of sadness that often lead me to cry, sometimes up to six times a day with no apprant reason. Insomnia, previously I would sleep like a log, now I spend sometimes up to three hours a night trying to get to sleep, which has been ongoing for the entire five weeks. I'm finding myself having these little 'episodes' where I break down and cry at almost anytime e.g. driving in the car,often I can feel a little worthless or hopeless and while I have had some of these little breakdowns in front of my boyfriend I find that they mostly affect me when I am alone and that I have more intense one's when I am by myself. I've never once thought about self harm, or suicide and I have always considered myself quite a strong person mentally. I just seem to be having these little epsiodes of intense crying and sadness that I really cannot explain, and of course the Insonmia Is starting to really affect me. Do you think my concerns are valid? Did you ever experience anything like this? And what did you do?
