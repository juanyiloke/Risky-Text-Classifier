FlashbacksStarted by Puggysusan?, 16-01-15 06:52 AMI have posted a lot on here I am so grateful for this site it has helped me a lot. From previous posts our son is a drug addict buthe does not live with us anymore I suppose this life now is what people call normal no drug dealers at the door or money lenders but he has not paid a bill for his phone and the company are after him we have wrote letters back saying we don't know where he is which I don't now. So last night I went to bed but could not sleep but had flashbacks of him living here and all the 11 years we had to put up with this crap. My counselling has finished at christmas but the flashbacks are vivid and upsetting frightened that I will make me feel ill again I have tried so hard to get to where I am today but I am frightening of falling back
