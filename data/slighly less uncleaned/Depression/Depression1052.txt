Frustrated that I let this illness take hold againHi,I am new here, not quite sure what happens with these forums or how much you are meant to talk about etc.Last week I was diagnosed again with extreme sever depression with suicidal tendencies. I have been in and out of depression since I was 14, I am 31 now, this time is worse than all the other times. I am so annoyed at myself that I allowed it to happen again.I try so hard to see the positive in things, but everything is a struggle, from getting out of bed, to brushing my teeth etc. I am back on medication and seeing a psychologist and have a great support network yet I still feel alone in this battle. But this time I feel as though I can't fight it.The other times I wan't working so I could focus on getting better, this time I am working long hours, commuting etc and just can't stand being at work, I just want to stay in bed all day.I hate feeling like this.
