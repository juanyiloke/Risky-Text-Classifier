Trapped in a wellHi please call me Adel,Mental illness has had its grip on me form many many yeas and has recently taken a dark turn. I am off work a the moment and don't know if I will ever return, I am waiting for a psych evaluation to see if I have bipolar disorder (at my request). I have been on and off anti-depressants since my early 20's, I am now 34.ÊÊI feel so lost and struggle with whats real and whats been a dream, Êa lot of the time now I just want to sleep as its the only time i feel free, when im awake i feel nothing but pain in my head and inside. I feel so alone right now.ÊÊAdel
