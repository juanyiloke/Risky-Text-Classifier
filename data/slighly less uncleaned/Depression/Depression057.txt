4th or 5th severe depression. and suicidal. Am in my 4th or 5th severe depression. I'm a male in my 60s.Am on a long trip to france and ran out of 2 of my meds a few months ago, trazodone and wellbutrin as they're not licensed here. Also the last few months very stressful so gradually sank in this depression which focuses on a 14 yr old event.I was conned and extorted in what should have obvious to me as a scam.Had my meds sent to me about 10 days ago and think I can feel a very faint improvement.I have on 2 occasions had remission in a few minutes which my doctor thinks indicates being bipolar.I have 3 questions and would be grateful if somebody can answer.1. Cbt seems to deal with distorted memories. I'm sure there are many people who have objective memories of past events. Can it also deal with non distorted memories. Or is there something else as effective2. Could I have remission from this episode as it focuses on the most stupid and humiliating event of my life.3. The event lasted at least a year and a half under constant pressure and threat. So could ptsd be involved.I think about suicide but learnt years ago that i won't do it. If there won't be a remission I have to reconsider.Thank you
