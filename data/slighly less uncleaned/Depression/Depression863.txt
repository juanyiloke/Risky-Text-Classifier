Êreally stressed out....I really like my current T. She has been my very first T and I feel like I've built trust with her and she has even gone the extra mile in some cases and put that extra effort in for me.But I have to find a new T...I've been looking through some new possible T's the past whole week. It has been so difficult in trying to find a new T though...the thought of no longer seeing my current T and having to find a completely new stranger is really distressing for me.Ê
