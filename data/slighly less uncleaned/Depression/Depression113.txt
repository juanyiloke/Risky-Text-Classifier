Vitamin D deficiency as a result of long-term severe depression?Posted over a year agoI have Bipolar 1, and my depressions are very severe, sometimes with psychosis, and can last up to two years at a time, during which i am pretty much bedridden and housebound. I only go out when I absolutely have to, and hide inside long, baggy clothes, hoods, scarves and dark glasses summer and winter (ie I hide).Over the past 5 years I have been diagnosed with bone pain and osteoarthritis. Bone pain is a primry presenting symptom of Vitamin D deficiency.Ive made an appointment to see my GP and in the meantime have started taking Vit D supplements, but I'd love to hear if anybody out there has had a similar problem?I would also be interested to know if anybody is aware if GPs are alive to this potential problem, because it seems to me that it could be a very common problem in people with long-term severe depression.Any thoughts?
