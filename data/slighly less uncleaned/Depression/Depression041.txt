feeling depressed and affecting my relationship with partner hello allfirst time i have openly spoken about my feelings to anyone but i am realy struggling at momentsomedays i want to just take off or end it all as i am struggling to deal with things.i have in past been on anti depressants because i  found out i could not father childreni got myself eventualy through that and got my life back togetheri have now been in a relationship with my new partenr for the last 14 year but recently my partner had a visit to doctors because of a lump found on her breast she was given an appointment at hospital for further checks and it was a male doctor that would be checking her this is where my problems started which i am disgusted with myself for one as i could not fully support my partner through this because of how i feel about other men doctors or not touching my partner other than me.it is first time in all those years another man has seen or touched my partner other than me and its this that has been realy getting to me to the point i cant even now look at my partners breast because all i can see is the doctor touching her. at the same time this was happening my partner closed of all her freinds so i could not see on her facebook account again which put other thoughts into my head as to why she had done this. upto that point i have never had any concerns at all about trust where she was or what she was doing ect becuase i love her and trust her.after i asked about this she said she did it to get my attention as we was barely talking ect. my head is all now messed up as i dont know what is truth or what is not truth and i filling in bits myself i just feel like i dont know whats what anymore so many feelings so much going off in my life at min as just lost my job also it all seems to much to handle and easiest option would be just to end it to stop this hurt i feel inside. i know in my own mind she would sooner have seen a female doctor than  a male as she knows how i feel about that and i know this also its just the thoughts of another man touching her i cant get out of my mind and i know if i carry on i will drive her away which is last thing i want to do i love her more than anything i have been trying to switch my thoughts off but its hard because my belifes are strong in that area i have read online other peoples discussions on similar thing and read where some people say its just a doc but then other post say its a doc but still a man ect and my head starts drifiting again. i wish i could turn these thoughts of but i cant so i dont know which way to turn cos i dont want to looose my partner because of the way i think. me and my partner have talked about this but now after nearly a month i am still asking my partner questions because i have no one to talk to other than her and its starting to wear her down to point she was crying and i feel horible for making her cry cos she is best thing in my life for many years and i dont want to ruin that but i still cant turn my thoughts and feelings offplease any advice for me or someone to just talk to so i can give my partner a break and hopefully save my relationship cos i love her more than anything and want to stop hurting her
