Depression and AnxietyPosted over a year agoHI, this is the 1st time i have basically reached out for help. I'm a very private and frustratingly stubborn person. But i desperately need help. I have a serious case of Depression and Anxiety. Saw a GP a few weeks back. Diagnosed me with his handy little checklist and gave me a stress relief booklet and sent me on my way. Even after sharing that suicide is on my mind everyday.I'm 23, unemployed, still staying at home with my mother and have had Depression for the larger part of my life. Though my family don't know about the Depression and Anxiety. Won't be telling them.I have been looking for help for months but things take too long. Plus i have limited internet access and can't phone any specialists in fear of my family finding out.I hate to admit it but i'm scared. I don't know how to move forward. I don't know how to even live my life.I've had a rough and confusing childhood and painful teens. Not the worst, but bad enough to mess me up this bad.
