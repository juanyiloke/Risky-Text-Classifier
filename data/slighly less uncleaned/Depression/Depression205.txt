  Advise needed.  Tbp90, 3 Hours AgoHi, am knew here but was hoping for some advice. I am a long time depression sufferer and have recently been feeling more suicidal. I take pills go to cbt and my gp. Not much seems to help except being around this one friend. I dunno why but she always makes me feel loved and cared for and safe. She takes care of like no one has ever bothered too. I feel automatically happier and the bad thoughts go. I Used to get to go round often but it's becoming less and less. I think it's because she finds me hard to deal with. When I'm not with her I often text her and sometimes I can be needy and I tell her my bad thoughts cause I feel Shes the one person I can tell. (She's my only friend.) She generally ignors me. She told me today that she feels near her own breaking point cause of me. She wants a few days to think and decide what to. So I guess I was wondering If I should just leave her alone for good because I'd hate for her to ever have to feel like I do. I genuinely just want her to be happy! I never thought there was a problem to between us although Iv no doubt dealing with a depressed person is very hard. I just know I'll struggle with out her. But what's best for her? Please. Any help gladly taken. Sorry if that doesn't make much sence!
