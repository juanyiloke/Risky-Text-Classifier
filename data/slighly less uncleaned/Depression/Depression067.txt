lost my mojo Where do I start.... at a point in life where everything is a chore, nothing cheers me up and every day I wake up more down at heart, more in pain and facing more worry and stress. ÊJust not happy with life anymore and can only see the problems with no 'good luck' occurring. ÊI'm fed up with it all. ÊI'm overworked and stressed with my job, things keep breaking down or need repairing at home, money seems to be on 'exit only' presently, the cat's not well, my partner's job is at risk and I'm in pain from osteo arthritis and probable fibromyalgia - which the stress and worry doesn't help in the least. ÊA few years ago my GP prescribed citalopram which I had an awful allergic reaction to, so I'm loathe to take anything like that again. ÊThe anti inflamms for my OA wreck my stomach, which just makes me feel even worse. ÊA lottery win would be nice but failing that all I can see ahead is more worry and less physical ability to cope with it. ÊI'm obviously stuck in a rut and honestly cant see how to help myself out of the big black hole I feel I'm in. ÊI know there are those far worse off than me and I try hard to remember that but that makes me even more unhappy thinking how bad life may get. ÊRun out of ideas here and really just want to crawl under a stone and forget even existing.
