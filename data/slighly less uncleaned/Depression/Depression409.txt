Mutual Support For Those Who Are Truly Stuck In A Situation...Ê  LaurynJcat ,ÊToday, 01:35 PMAnd I mean really, truly stuck. ÊSomething there is no way out of - like a job, a housing situation, your family....ÊÊThis is not a thread to encourage you to get out of your situation, it's for ways to cope when you can't get out of it.ÊFor me, I'm stuck in several ways. Ê1. ÊMy job. ÊI am financially dependent on my job, and there are no other jobs I could get into that have remotely the same salary. ÊI took my job in the first place because the salary allowed me to work just 3 days per week, which I wanted because I write fiction. ÊNow due to our circumstances I've had to take another day each week (sometimes more) in a job that is repetitive and mindless.2. ÊMy housing situation. ÊMy husband and I left a wonderful housing co-op to buy an apartment (feeling that we "should" buy a place, because you're supposed to, right)? ÊThen he became unable to work due to his disability, and now we're stuck paying a mortgage we really can't afford. ÊThere's no way to get out without taking a loss and getting even deeper in debt, so we have to wait it out until the construction across the street is finished (2-3 years) and we can sell our place without taking a loss. Ê3. ÊMy marriage. ÊI hesitate to include this because I love my husband and I'm with him voluntarily, but for most of our 20-year marriage I've had to support him (no, I didn't know ahead of time that would happen) and we've struggled with poverty. ÊIt really wears you down.ÊÊSo, that's where I am right now. ÊHoping to hear from those in similar situations and we can provide mutual support for each other via posts or PMs.Ê
