ÊSons first birthday is also making me depressed.My son's first birthday party is on the 26th, and I'm starting to get really depressed about it. My boyfriends family is great, if have no problems with them what so ever.the problem is my family. My dad passed away last September and it broke my whole family up with fights and everything. My dad and I'd were fighting and it didn't see him because he had cancer, and in my own ****ed up way it was so my memories of us werenot him being so close to death,Anyways, so this leads to have to invite only certain family embers on my side. Which is all fine and dandy. Because it know a lot of people say it - but it legitimately don't care about my family. Mostly because the way it was brought up. So only two members from my side will make it.Êon top of it, it's my mother's birthday but she legally can't go because of an altercation with my younger half sister and she isn't allowed to be around children who can't defend themselves. (Nothing sexual, it was violence) and it makes me really sad because my whole life i favored my mom and wish she could go so bad. I'm know even if she could she wouldn't because she'd feel too uncomfortable, which i totally understand. But it sucks that i have to deal with these people from my family that is can't stand and wish my mother could be there for my son -her only grandchild first birthday.
