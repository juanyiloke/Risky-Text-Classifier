Trying my best.Hi everyone. This is the first time I have ever opened up about myself. I've tried to do so in the past with friends and family but it makes them uncomfortable.ÊI am really struggling with everything at the moment.I have no career prospects, I've lost job after job. I cannot feel anything any more. Is this normal? I have been so tired and weary - I don't know what to do. I've never asked for help before.
