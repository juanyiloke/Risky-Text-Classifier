New to depression HeyIve just been to my drs and have been told im suffering with anxiety and depression,i was wondering if anyone could help me understand a little better?I have kyphoscoliosis (curvature of the spine) chiari malfirmation (pressure in the bottom of the brain) and a few other things,since being a kid ive been in and out of hospital with ops and have alway delt with it well, im generally a happy person despite everything.Im now 26 and have started to have problems with depression and anxiety, some days i feel absolutly fine,when i feel bad it feels like the end of the world,i cry for no reason,ive a great family,i got married last year and my husband is my full time carer and is amazing, i dont really have anything to be upset about.With depression can you feel ok one day and awful the next? I sleep terribly always getting pressure sores on my back as i have a hunch in onr side,i find it hard to get to sleep,and recently have been having weird dreams that stick it my head all the next day,ive ended up dreading bed time ans have started getting anxious about it all,i get this bad feeling where my chest feels like its burning i get emotional and hate being in my bedroom.Ive told my Dr all of this and hes put me on beta blockers to help with the anxiety and amitriptyline for depression. I feel better for going to soeak to him and have wonderful support from my family.So is it normal to be ok one day and not the next? When ever i talk about it i get the bad feeling and tight burn in my chest,feel a bit paniky, i wish i knew why this has started recently. Its the worst feeling,id much rather have my back hurt even more then have all this going in in my head...Any help or storys of how you get through it would be great..Stacey
