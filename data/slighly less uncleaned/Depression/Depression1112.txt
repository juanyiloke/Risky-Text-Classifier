Our constant passengerHi guys. This is my first time here- I'm not sure what I am hoping to find here, but thought I would give it a go.I have battled with depression since my teens and more prevalently post natally and beyond. I am on anti-depressants and, try to meditate regularly, have seen a psych on and off - but mainly try to navigate it all myself.ÊRecently I am just exhausted of my motivation, drive and will. I just want to sleep. Basic tasks are almost impossible. The energy it takes to put on a strong and happy facade at work and around friends and family is wearing thin. I just want to hibernate. I don't want to do anything. Not a thing.ÊIve been here before, but struggle to see how to pull myself out, what to allow myself and where to push myself? It is overwhelming. No amount of positive thinking or effort helps now.... It is all consuming.ÊI feel it in my stomach, in my chest, in my heart and in my head. It isn't fair.ÊI don't want to share this with friends, my husband knows but there is only so much I want to unload on him...... I feel like there is no one to talk to..... So I suppose that's why I'm here.ÊMi am very used to this just being a part of who I am.... But sometimes it's just too much.Ê
