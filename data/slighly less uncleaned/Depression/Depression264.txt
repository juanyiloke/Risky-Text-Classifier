ÊI desperately need help Êkbox2015,Ê2  Hi. I'm new to this forum. Quick Google search led me here. I'm at the point where I don't know what to do anymore. I've been through hell with my depression and I'm literally at breaking point now.ÊHere's a small bit of information that might help you answer me.I've suffered with depression as far back as I can remember. I'm 24 now so it's been a long Time. Been getting properly treated for it say the last 8 months however have been briefly treated a few years ago. I'm on mirtazapine anti depressants atm and have been on this tablet since November. Over time I've been slowly breaking down getting worse as the days go on. It got to the point where I got sectioned and spent time in a mental health hospital which was good while I was there it was useful. But I eventually got discharged. Since people have known I'm ill they have all dissappeared. My friends have gone. My girlfriend left me. I feel like I have no1. I lost my dad in February which was tough. I spend my days now locked away. There's nothing for me to do which I know isn't healthy but I have no choice. there's been times in the past where I've come close to ending my life but now this time am more convinced than ever that I want to do it. I Dont know who to turn to or what to do so this is why I have came here. Looking for help or advice.Please don't hesitate to reply or even send me a private message. I'm desperate.ThanksKevin
