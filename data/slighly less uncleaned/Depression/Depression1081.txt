So sad and I don't know what to do...I feel sad a lot and constantly worry about what everyone thinks of me all the time. I question myself in every aspect of my life. It doesn't matter how hard I work, how much exercise I do or how many material things I have. It doesn't matter. None of it matters. I feel like I will always have self doubt and always feel like a failure and always care about what people think of me.
