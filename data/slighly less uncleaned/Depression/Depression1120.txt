Breakdowns - what are the warning signs & what are the symptoms?Dear all,I've recently been having experiences which are (not ironically) increasing my anxiety that I might be approaching a breakdown. A week or so ago I had my mental healthcare plan renewed at my GP. We didn't really discuss much that might have been obvious triggers, but afterwards, when I got into my car I just started crying and struggled to stop.I've been googling for information but can't really find any that isn't vague. Perhaps that's just the way this sort of thing goes, but I'm really trying to understand what the warning signs of a breakdown are, and what the symptoms are, because knowing - I guess - is half the battle.Cheers
