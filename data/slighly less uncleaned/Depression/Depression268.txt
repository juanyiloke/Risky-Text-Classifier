ÊDealing with depression after drinking alcohol Êmycityyourmountain,Ê2  Hi all,I have never posted here before even though I have suffered moderate to severe depression for well over a decade. In the past year, luckily, I have found a medication that works for me and started to feel a LOT more stable and a little more positive about things. However, lately I have noticed that whenever I have had something to drink, the next several days to a week are truly awful, almost as bad as the worst periods of my depression, where I barely have the energy to move, can't seem to focus on or enjoy anything, can't eat or sleep much, etc. which makes distracting myself until the hangover and low mood passes (and luckily, these days, it does eventually pass) extremely difficult and painful.ÊI realize that the best way to deal with this is not to drink at all and that drinking is a bad idea when you suffer from depression but this has only happened the last few times I have been drinking, possibly because (sadly) I never used to notice it much, because I was depressed more or less all the time. Anyway, I was wondering if any one else experiences this even though they are doing better generally thanks to medication, and if you have any tips on how to make the next few days slightly easier to cope with? Again, I realize that the best thing to do is not to drink in the first place but I am wondering if there is anything anyone has tried that has helped to ease alcohol-induced low mood? Any help would be really appreciated!Thank you to anyone who reads this and tc,Laci
