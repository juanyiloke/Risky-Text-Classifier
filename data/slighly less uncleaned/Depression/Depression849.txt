Who wants to talk about... crying.So yes, I kinda wanna get into people's business about crying (but only if they want to share). Because it isn't something I see talked about much on here. I mean, it gets mentioned of course, but I haven't seen anyone talk about crying much in-depth. Who wants (or needs) to talk about crying?I feel a really big need to talk about it right now, for reasons I don't really know. I feel on the verge of tears today. I had a bit of eye-leakage earlier. I feel like I need to have a big, snotty cry but I just can't.ÊAnd also, most of us cry about depressing things, right? But for me it seems like beautiful things are what make me want to cry - like sunlight on grass/through trees, or flowers, or children playing. Those things tear me up and I don't know why. I also cry about very small things.Who feels like they need to cry but just can't? I once had a whole 2 and a half year period where I could not cry, though many times I wanted to (and felt I needed to). Then something awful happened which made me able to cry again, and now I cry a lot more than I used to.
