All the help I can getBeen low for a long time I think.Bought up 7 children who are my rocks.Hubby is Fifo worker 10 years ongoing.Have always held it together somehow but now I'm crumbling.i feel so lost and confused about everything these days.cannot sleep, cannot eat.Concentrating on anything is very difficult.I cry a lot.Go for days without even speaking sometimes when I'm home alone,which is a lot .i have never felt so helpless to help myself.my husband does not understand at all why I'm always blue.he is a very social person. My stomach churns constantly and I feel nervous most of the time. Some days I feel like I've no reason to be here really, though I know I do.My only constant is my daily work. routinely day in day out just do don't have to think because thinking is just to hard right now because it's all such a mess.im about to see a Doctor this Friday prompted by a friend.Im hoping it's a start on the right track because this black hole is consuming my every waking minute leaving me exhausted, vague and detached .I feel at this point that there is no hope really ....so please please assure me I can overcome this demon and beat it and begin to live again....please.
