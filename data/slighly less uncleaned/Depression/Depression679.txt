I thought I was doing okStarted by Bluebell?, 28-01-15 02:27 PMI haven't posted on here for a while as I've been feeling fairly stable in recent weeks and I thought I was getting a lot better. I'm so glad I went back on Prozac - I was really struggling with life before whereas now I feel like I can cope better. I'm experiencing a bit of a dip at the moment though. I'm getting really depressed about work. I have lots of work on at the moment (I'm a freelancer) but it's all really badly paid and I feel like I'm working so hard for little financial reward. I've been given a new project to work and I'm really not familiar with the subject matter or interested in it. I'm struggling badly and feel out of my depth. I feel horribly anxious and keep feeling frightened about the future - I don't know why. Since moving to a small village, not having a car and getting my dog I don't have many work options around me which is why I'm clinging to my freelance work that I do from home. I'm so unhappy though. I feel very alone and isolated.
