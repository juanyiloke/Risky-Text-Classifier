Not quite sure where to post this question.... Hope here is ok?I visited a friend and her baby yesterday and when she changed her nappy I saw the mustard yellow poo. I thought to myself, 'I remember when my baby's poo used to look like that'ÊThen it occurred to me that it should STILL look like that. She's 6 months but still EBF. For a little while now her poo has been somewhere between yellow/green/brown. Quite dark actually. And she poos roughly every 2-3 days.She's a very healthy baby. Feeds well, sleeps through, naps well etc.Should I alert the doctor or HV about her poo poo?
