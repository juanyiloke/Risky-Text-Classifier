Failing two modules at university still possible to get a 2:1?by ineedtorevise127Hi there,I am a first year student. At my uni, you need to pass 6/8 modules to progress into Year 2. I am finding most of the modules okay just 2 which I find really difficult. My question is if I fail those two modules do I have to retake them? Because both are maths related and I absolutely struggle with maths been getting like 20/30 percent maximum in both. I feel that even if I got 20 I just want to leave the grade as it is. Also will this stop me from getting a 2:1.My first year is worth 10 percent , 2nd yr 30 percent and 3rd year 60 percent. And do the failed marks get added to your mean mark? Or do they just count the ones you passed. Thanks
