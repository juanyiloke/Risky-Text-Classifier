Hello, newbie hereHi all,I'm new here, and so glad to have found this forum. I was diagnosed back in January this year, but haven't really met any other patients in my age bracket (I'm 40), so it feels like it has been a very lonely journey. I am having surgery on 17th September (Bowel resection with hysterectomy and ovary removal), and hoping for liver surgery at a later date. I'm petrified quite frankly, and worried that I'll end up with a permanent stoma.Anyhow, it's a comfort to read all your amazingly informative posts on here, and to know I'm not alone!Ivy
