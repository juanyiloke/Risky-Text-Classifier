 Should I end my life?  tsimmo15, 2  Ever since I was born I've been a pushover I was always made fun of at school via it being rumours or because I'm ugly and fat etc at the moment I'm 18 years old I have 3 friends who take the piss out of me quite often, I share the loft room of my house with 2 of my brothers as a bedroom, it is completely unfurnished, dusty, cob webs everywhere and generally just not a very pleasant room to be in, it has been this way for years and my parents have only been in my room a handful of times ever, they don't really care about getting it furnished so it's something I've stopped getting my hopes up for, I work a zero hours contract job with hardly any hours a week, I hardly ever have any money or clothes. I am always very shy and find it hard to conversate with people, Even though I am a man I cry myself to sleep almost every night, a lot more bad things tend to happen to me rather than good things, the best thing that I can say happened to me is that I got a B in maths and English at GCSE level but yet I am the most unsuccessful person I know, I really hate being me and I really want to end my life but the only reason I havnt is because I don't want to put my family through the pain so every morning I wake up, I put a lid on the pain, paint a smile on my face and basically lie to the whole world
