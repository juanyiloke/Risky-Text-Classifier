  Baby steps.. :)Most of your probably don't remember me at all. For those who do, you probably remember a very close call I had concerning suicide. That was a few months ago, and I have since gotten much better. I barely think of suicide anymore, it used to be something I thought about several times every day but now? Very rare and its only of course when I'm alone in the middle of the night. I am avidly looking for a job, I have a boyfriend and have taken ENORMOUS steps when it comes to my social anxiety. I still have my reservations and of course I'm nervous still but I'm learning to live with it and let go. I can actually hold a conversation with a complete stranger, is it completely charming? Lol, not even close. It's almost always an awkward conversation but I still seem to be making good impressions, obviously because I now have a boyfriend! After a few minor hiccups in the past month, I'm extremely fine. I never really thought I could say I was fine, without it actually being true. Am I happy? I wouldn't say that because I still have my bad days (suicidal thoughts still occur). I feel like I am on the right road. I'm feeling motivated and thats a miracle in itself! I'm loosing weight, I'm actually showering, I clean my room daily, wash my clothes, actively look for a job, I've stopped blaming EVERYONE else for all of MY problems and I'm learning how to push myself. I am going out job hunting tomorrow and the next day and then I have a date with my boyfriend. He's already introduced me to his parents. Which almost gave me a heart attack but I calmed myself down enough to be able to actually speak to them. I was awkward but its better than not talking at all, right? Well, I doubt anyone cares but its nice for MYSELF to read what I've wrote here. Reminding myself that I am making progress and its a nice thing to be proud of yourself.
