Unexplained spikes in BSHi there, I'm new to the forum. My mum is type 2 diabetic and I prepare all her food etc. (total disaster btw trying to cook 'carb free' over Christmas but that's another story!)We are part of the t2t prog and I noted that after morning porridge and 2 cups milky coffee, mum's BS spikes to around 11-12mmol. If she oversleeps it spikes higher to around 13.2 (post prandial) - the nurse at our surgery said to take her medication earlier in the day to help this... which we do if she is likely to want a lie in. HOWEVER... this is what I don't understand... 2.5 hours after 2 very thin pieces of wholemeal toast this morning equating to 15g carb (each slice = v. low in sugars also) with 3 small dry fried tomatoes on top, scrape of low fat lurpak... her BS was 13.1mmol... very disheartening when we are trying to hard.Thoughts?Also... has anyone tried the Nutribullet? Is it any good for juicing veg (obvs not for juicing fruit, being diabetic) but if you use it for veg is it oj or does it break down latent sugars too quickly?Thanks!
