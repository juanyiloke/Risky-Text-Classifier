Still coughing after a month________________________________________I've been coughing since March 13th! I've been in the yellow zone because of rattling sometimes when I breathe and for feeling short of breath. The rattling gets a little bit better when I cough but it always comes back even with them extra asthma medication. I cough up mucus sometimes and today I feel achy from coughing and my airways feel really irritated. I had to take a cough expectorant/suppressant last night to sleep. My cough seemed to be getting better for a little but never went away and then the rattling started. I went to the doctor who said my lungs sounded clear that it was a post-viral cough that could last several weeks! He didn't give me anything. It wouldn't bother me as much if it was just a cough without the rattling and feeling out of breath both at rest and upon exertion. My family doctor has been on maternity leave since December and has had different doctors replacing her. The one I saw on April 1st is no longer there. A message says her office is closed until May 1st so I'll have to go to an after hours clinic or the ER. I also feel hot and cold, get sweats without a fever. Like earlier on. I really think I need some other medication.
