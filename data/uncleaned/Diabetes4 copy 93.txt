Do you get professional advice/information ?Reading  posts on here I get the impression that many newbies ,like myself, do not get much information/support on how to cope /manage their BG .The first I found anything was wrong was finding a recorded phone message to contact my G.P as soon as pos., when I arrived home from holiday, It took me a while to be able to contact her and when I did she just said my BG. was high and Id have to go on tablets ,I pleaded to be allowed to try and get it down myself, but she wouldnt agree.I wasnt given any advice about diet etc.apart from on here, which has been a great help. I had a very bad reaction on starting these tablets 1000 at first, hot/shivery /nausea and visited the surgery  a few times , some of my meds were changed and my tablets were changed to 500  twice a day ,and I do seem to be managing OK , I do have other health conditions ,which are under investigation at the moment,and I get tired quickly ,so Im not sure what  causes what
