DAFNE - good or bad experiencesMy control used to be all over the place despite my best efforts. I don't overeat and exercise regularly. My HbA1c in August was 102 which is horrific. At the end of September I went on a DAFNE course and I learnt so much. I learnt to calculate my insulin in relation to what I intended to eat and my control is so much improved. My last HbA1c was 56.The DAFNE approach might mean more injections, but it offers so much flexibility. During the course I switched from Lantus once a day to Levemir twice a day. I'm glad I have got it sorted out as have never fancied the idea of wearing a pump.I'm just interested to know your experiences of the DAFNE course, good, bad or indifferent.
