ÊGoing to InpatientSo my psychiatrist mentioned inpatient today. He was saying it was a possibility but that we could continue trying from home for now if my latest tests come back showing nothing is hugely wrong with my heart or my blood work. My parents asked me if I thought I needed to be there, though... And I think maybe this is too much for me to handle.ÊI feel like a huge attention seeker saying I feel like I need to be at the hospital but right now my own mind is my worst enemy. I don't know if I can handle the times when I'm alone and I'm the only one who can hold myself accountable for my choices on whether to eat or not to eat. I might go in tonight... I don't know. I'm scared of any decision I choose. I'm scared to live with myself and I'm scared to go into the hospital.
