Going from cold to hot Has anyone else had trouble when going from outside in the cold to inside? I have always noticed a difference but last month or so it's got harder and harder to control. It's taking quite a bit of Ventolin which leaves me shaky and having paliptations. I am a teacher in a seniors school and a youth worker and have 2 children so i can't really just sit down and it can be quite distressing for the Children im working with or my own children. I have spoken to my dr who upped my symbicort dose and I have just finished a 6 week course of preds. I thought maybe I was having panic attacks because I was worrying about it but I had it happen when I went to the drs once and he confirmed it was asthma. It's quite embarrassing as well when I walk into a shop or something lol. I do wrap up warm but any suggestions I would be grateful! I am at my wits end and just dread having to go out. Plus it's actually quite tiring and am getting through blue inhalers at quite a rate. Thank you :-)
