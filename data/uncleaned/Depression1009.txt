 Mid life crisis and depression as well!7 April 2015Hi everyone, I am new to using online forums so bear with me. Recently I had what I consider a breakdown. My relationship wasn't going well as my girlfriend had become a workaholic and I resented the hours which she worked. Work was incredibly stressful (I am a high school teacher). I could not derive any pleasure from anything. 4 weeks ago it became too much and I was seriously wanting to end it all. Fortunately I didn't go through with it although it was pretty close. Now my girlfriend has left me because she cannot cope with my negativity. I am probably going to sell the house and I have nowhere to live. I was hoping to have a family but that seems highly unlikely. Everyone has been really helpful at work and my friends have been pretty understanding. I feel lost and alone. The future I had planned is gone and the only thing I care about are my two dogs. I really don't want to end up alone. I am seeking help and have a gp which is really good and I am seeing a counsellor. Does anyone know of any support groups in the inner west of Sydney? The easter break has been really tough and I cannot stop thinking about the past and the poor decisions which I have made. Any suggestions?
