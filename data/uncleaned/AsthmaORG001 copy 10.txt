Difficult Asthma Clinic Referral Hi,My consultant asked a difficult asthma clinic to see me just before Christmas. I welcomed this as I had to change consultant earlier this year and I don't really agree with what he says. I know he is questioning my diagnosis (possibly thinking it is hyperventilation/anxiety or at the very least he thinks I am on too much medication for it. I believe this has caused my GP to change their attitude to my treatment too. I have enjoyed a few months of some stability but am a bit anxious as we enter the hayfever season (I had ten admissions last Summer including 2 to HDU). Anyway, I have received a letter to go to the clinic next week and wondered what to expect. Will they be able to quickly advise on treatment or will it be like when I was first referred to secondary care and I have to go through months of tests before anything? Also does anyone have any experience of seeing them when relatively well? My LUng Function Tests are usually good but when I start to feel ill, I get worse very quickly (last year I saw a GP at 5pm who wouldn't give me pred as I wasn't wheezing or really struggling and was in HDU by 7pm on magnesium, nebs and oxygen). I don't really get nervous about appointments but I am feeling quite apprehensive about this one.
