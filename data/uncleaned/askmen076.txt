What should i do? My future2012-11-16, 02:06 PMI got promoted at my job to a management position to where i work 40+ weekly I'm also going to college full time, i am young and i am just trying to build up my future. By the time i graduate i will have the educational and the work experience to get a way higher position at my job. I am a 20 year old living with parents making good income and not paying any bills so what ever i get is whatever i keep for my personal desires or goes in saving accounts. My job is stressful and i thought it would be easy but ever since i got this job my life consists off school ---> sleep ---> work ----> school and so forth. I work 6 days and i am losing desire everyone tells me to enjoy life i am young but what is there to enjoy. I mean all this is so that when i graduate college 2 years from now then pursue master so that by the time I'm 25 i can get married and live a happy life. I don't want to quit because i will never make as much as i am now, and the company is worldwide so i can go anywhere in the world. Job is also third shift, classes mornings. Before this i worked at under appreciated jobs that have no advancement opportunities what so ever so i feel like this is my big shotShould i keep doing what i am doing or to just get a part time job and enjoy lifeHell is the Impossibility of reason
