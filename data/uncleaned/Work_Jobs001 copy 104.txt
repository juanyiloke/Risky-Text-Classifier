Interviewer had not read my CV________________________________________I had an interview yesterday and I was first interviewed by the technical lead. He had my CV in front of him and seemed to know it fairly well as he was asking me questions related to specific parts of my work experience. After that I was interviewed by a woman who I think was HR but I am not sure. She had my CV with her but one of the first things she said was "I haven't read your CV, I never read CV's". I answered her questions as best I could but I did get the impression from her body language that she wasn't that enamoured with me.She made a big deal of the fact that I had been out of work for six months (which is not that long really I think) even though I told her I have been looking for work every day during that time and I have been for a good few interviews.Also she got confused as to the reasons for my departure from my last two jobs (the first was because the company was on the verge of going bust and the second was because the work I was doing was too boring). I explained this to her but she still got the two mixed up. She was flicking between the pages of my CV in a flustered manner and seemed to be very scatty-brained. I was fairly p****d-off that she hadn't read my CV but I didn't indicate this to her in any way. I am still a bit annoyed about it now even though it has happened to me once before. The other time the interviewer made it less obvious as he asked me what college I went to (I knew he hadn't read my CV then). It was quite bizarre that the woman yesterday admitted it to me and seemed to be almost proud of it ("I never read CV's"). I have been for loads of interviews and been the victim of all kinds of ignorant behaviour (the interviewer looking out the window while I was talking, doodling on a notebook etc.) so I am not that surprised but still quite annoyed. I think what may have happened is that the first interviewer may have said to her after he came out "such and such a guy is here for an interview. If you want to you can have chat with him". If she hadn't read my CV she should have said "No, I don't see the point as I haven't read his CV so I wouldn't know what to ask him".I am not sure if I am still interested in the job if this is the kind of person they employ but I just wanted to know if I am turned down should I say this in an email of reply (that this person had not read my CV). They will probably say it sour grapes but if I was her boss I would want to know and I wouldn't be impressed. I got the feeling that she didn't like me and may not get the job because of this.I just don't think it's right that she should get away with it as the interviewee is expected to prepare as diligently as possible before an interview (and I do) so why shouldn't the interviewer do the same?
