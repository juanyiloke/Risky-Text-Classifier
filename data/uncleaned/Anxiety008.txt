Anxiety/panic attacks citalopram to sertralineHello there,I'm 35 and have suffered from severe anxiety/panic attacks for nearly 20 years. I have been on citalopram for 14 years. My attacks have never disappeared but when it was really bad it took the edge of it. However, in the last year it has really been up and down which made me think that it's no longer working for me or not properly anyway. I went to see my gp on Friday who said try sertraline. Absolutely terrified of the change as in the last few months I felt ok but kind of emotionally numb. I don't get excited about things.. I can cope with things but I just feel flat and I just had enough of my partner saying you never seen happy. All I reply is "I'm fine, sorry if I don't jump up and down". I feel awfully guilty as he is right. Anyway, I have taken my last citalopram 25mg last night and have taken my first sertraline 50mg tonight. I'm not going to lie I'm terrified that I might get extremely anxious and awful and full of side effects. My thought I had to ween off cit first but he said no you can go straight on sertraline! And I was like "are you sure? After 14years of taking the same med? Yes sure... " I know he is a doctor but I'm still terrified!!! My partner took the sertraline box for me not to read the side effects as he said that otherwise I'll read every single one of them and that it would stress me out even more. He is not wrong!  has anyone had to pass from one to another like this after many years? I would be so grateful to hear your experience. Many thanks x
