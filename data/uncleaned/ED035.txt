I'm just really worriedI didn't accept that I had an ED before now but when reading about it online I knew that it was true. I'm really scared of gaining weight and can't talk to my family as the majority are overweight so anything they say about being healthy seems hypocritical and just irritates me. A nurse told me that I should write down what I am feeling so I've decided to do it here; today I tried to eat more and now I feel sick and horrible, usually I would just skip dinner or run for an hour then eat less but I want to get better so I think I will eat. It still scares me though, even though the food is not unhealthy the amount of calories scares me, especially in carbs. I wish I could be like the rest of my family and not care but I really don't want to end up overweight like them.
