Am I being unreasonable? Travelling for work________________________________________Hey all. Just want to get other people's opinion on something. I am travelling with work next week for a training course, getting a train at 15:30 on Sunday afternoon, I will return home the following Friday at about 23:00. I figured that seen as I am away from home for nearly a full week, and have to lose most of a weekend day too, that I would ask for a day off the following week in lieu of this, I was told no. I am a salaried employee, so I understand that I may need to do extra hours/etc with no additional payment (we have never received overtime pay ever). But I think this is work being particularly unfair, is it?
