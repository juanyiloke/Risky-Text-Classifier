My uncles situationI taught Id share this to you as an example of how badly men are treated after a divorce.About 7 years ago my uncle got a divorce, he had one child with this woman and raised the woman's other child(his step child).My uncle has his own business and several property'sHis ex didn't want to stay in the family home and he was ordered to buy her a new one which he is still paying the mortgage on.He had to sell one of his property's which she had never put a penny into and give her half.She lives in the new house paying nothing towards it, with her new boyfriend and child and my uncles child.She works and so does her new fella In a free home.My uncle remarried and has 3 kids now with his new wife. His ex texts him whenever she needs more moment for his child with her despite having now mortgage/rent and two incomes coming in. And if she doesn't get it puts the child up to asking the father why didn't you give mam the money.He would be better off getting a log cabin putting it in his mothers back garden and declaring bankruptcy.
