My 8 month old DD has what our doctor thinks is a gastro virus. It started on Saturday night with vomiting and a fever then turned into just diarrhoea. The fever has gone now. The doctor's advice was to keep her hydrated and it should pass within a few days.After every feed she fills her nappy once, maybe twice. We are on day 4 and she still has diarrhoea. I am trying to keep her hydrated, feeding as normal although she doesn't always take it and offering sips of water (limited success) and rehydration solution (she point blank refuses, very tight pursed lips!). She isn't interested in food, other than a couple of spoonfuls of apple and pear purée earlier today, which prompted another full nappy.I wondered if anyone has experience of this with your LO and how many days it lasted? Also, once your baby started to show signs of recovery, what foods did you introduce to help them get back to normal. I'm overseas and don't have a HV to call upon.
