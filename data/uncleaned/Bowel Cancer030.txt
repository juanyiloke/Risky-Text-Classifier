Good NewsHiI have returned from the Hospital after being given the news that I am [b]Cancer Free[b] for the first time in a couple of years I suppose including all the time I was told there was nothing wrong with me! I have a meeting beginning of December with the bowel surgeon to get a date set for stoma reversal. CT scans to be done every 3 months for the following 12 months which is apparently the norm.I was diagnosed a year ago next Friday and was told I was stage 4 with large liver mets the back end of January 2014 and things not looking to good after my Hartmanns and scan was done. I really can't thank the people on here enough for the support and advice they have given me over the year and I hope that you all get the results you and your families are striving for. I'm also aware that the nasty little buggers can come back and bite at any time but for the time being Im going to savour the moment with my family and friends. Even the cold bottles of beer out the fridge feel a little warmer this evening, either the neuropathy in my fingers is getting better or the fridge is knackered. I'll check tomorrow.Ivan      more good news!Hi friends.To add to Ivan's wonderful news,,I too had the hospital today, and i was told my scan was clear again with nothing new showing. I still had the blurb about thinking the lung dots were a cancer spread, but when I asked how they can be sure, the onc said they cant be. The way they behaved, eg came, then went with chemo,,makes them think they were cancerous, BUT, they still could have been inflammation she said. And, also a slim chance that if they were cancer, they had such a good response, they may never return. 3 monthly scans continue, and, for the moment I am going to enjoy a nice glass of red! Cheers Ivan!
