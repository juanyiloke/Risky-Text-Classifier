can't live with this anxiety and anger anymorehi i'm a 18 year old male and i can't seem to keep myself together. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depersonalization disorder. I have had both for about 3 years and its been ruining my life, i feel like the world around me is not real and i have anxiety and feel anxious and have tense muscles 247. My doctor gave me zoloft about 2 months ago but i haven't taken it yet because i like to drink beer everyday. So i recently lost my first love, i gave my heart to her and i was such a great guy to her and she ended up treating me like crap for no reason and throwing my feelings in the trash. We have been together for 3 months. I also lost my part time job and they fired me for no reason at all. After all this happened my self identity and self esteem went down the drain. And i feel so much angers towards my ex i can't stop thinking about it. I feel so much anger inside that out of know where i will start stabbing a garbage bag with a knife and imagine myself shooting up a shopping mall or brutally beating my ex with a metal baseball bat.ÊThese thoughts consume my mind all the time and i just feel so lonely and hurt after what my ex did to me that i don't feel worthy of being loved. All i really do is it in my room all day and listen to music. My depersonalization is driving me insane, i just feel like a robot in a dream like i have no purpose or feel anything good, I also have social anxiety disorder so i don't even want to leave the house. At this point im ready to end everything, it seems like i just can't find happiness and when i do i get screwed over or it gets taken away from me. I don't know what i did to deserve all this crap but i just feel hopeless and empty. I guess being a nice guy just gets you no where while all the assholes get everything they want, it makes sick and i f***ing hate human beings. Im ready to just go out and kill anyone i see
