Silence around menstruationI came across this little game today called Tampon Run. It's a simple game that two women wrote for a programme they were part of, and it involves running and throwing tampons at people  The blurb at the start interested me, though, where they say that there is a culture of not speaking about menstruation, despite the fact that half the population do it for a significant portion of their lives, and things like violence seem to be much less taboo than what is, after all, a perfectly normal bodily function.This also brought me back to a conversation I had with a friend a few weeks ago about the dreadful sex conversation we had with our respective parents (just one conversation to cover your whole life and the rest was done at school), and learning a tiny amount about periods from our mothers. We recalled filling in some details from our collective experience during girls-only huddles on the school yard and the realisation that at other times of the month there might be different types of mucus and not knowing if that was normal but not really knowing if it was okay to ask. Even now, as an almost-thirty year old who feels fairly open about that sort of thing, I'm aware that not all my friends are comfortable or able to talk about things their sexual organs do and who would even be embarrassed if someone saw a sanitary towel or tampon in their handbag. I was wondering what your experiences are and if you encounter the same things in your life. Maybe you feel it's just something that shouldn't be spoken about, maybe it's no big deal to you at all, but I think it would be interesting to hear each others thoughts on it
