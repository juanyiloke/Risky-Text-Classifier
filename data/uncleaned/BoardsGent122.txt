Suit pricesI suppose there probably is no real defining answer to this and is probably more of a personal preference but you never know till you ask.Im wondering whats the minimum price you should be paying for a suit. As in, if its any cheaper it just couldn't be good quality.Sometimes I see advertisements for suits and its 150-200euro includes the suit, shirt and tie and I just cant help but wonder about the quality.And on the far end of the scale at what point is needless expenditure. I mean, if the average worker turns up in 5K saville row suit he'd get some funny looks. So wheres the upper cut off?
