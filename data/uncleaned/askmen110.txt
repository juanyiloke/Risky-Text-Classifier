The best way to fire someone...2012-01-15, 11:30 PMI hired a girl this summer to help bring in clients and she isn't working out. She is a good worker and if there was something else that she could do I would love to have her do it but there isn't. I feel bad because I like the girl but I know this week I'm going to have to let her go.So this is the question. My older brother told me I should talk to her and give her 90 days to make a difference. Another friend of mine said that if she hasn't done it yet then she's not going to and to just let her go. The state I am in allows me to fire her for any reason so I'm not worried about that. I'm just wondering when I fire her how would you go about it? I haven't fired anyone in a long time and it's always been agonizing for me to fire people I like. Any tips on how to go about it with a clean conscious?Live, Thrive, Survive!
