6 month visit with DSNIn common with most on here and despite trying to maintain a good diet and BG levels I find the prospect of the visits somewhat daunting.No matter. I turned up, on time, and was greeted warmly and introduced to another DSN from our local hospital. I'm also fortunate that this visit is at my GP surgery rather than a trip to the hospital.No problems found with kidney output, ketones, blood, protein et al despite having recently been diagnosed as having cysts on both kidneys which are being addressed.A1C was 44, same as last time which I gather is approx 7.2%. Not bad at all.Managing a good diet, following drug therapy (if any) in a timely manner pays dividends for me.I have other co-morbidities along with the big D, still waiting for heart bypass surgery, other health matters are being addressed. Not too shabby to be honest. Up to me to ensure it continues along the same lines. Would love to get a lower A1C but on my drug therapy it is unlikely, but still something for which to aim.
