Struggling with recovery: help please!Hi, I'm new here. There are no support groups in my entire county that deal with ED's so these forum sites are kind of a last hope.For the past 2-3 years I have gradually become anorexic, I went into a clinic last year which was unsuccessful however over the past 11 months I have battled the disorder alone and have in a way 'healed'. I am at the healthiest weight I've ever been (though my BMI is still underweight) and my love for food has slowly regrown.However, I am struggling MASSIVELY to accept the fact my body is putting on weight, I really am wondering whether going down the self healing route was a good idea. I do worry every week about relapsing, fat and calories and intake still can rule some of my day though I won't restrict anymore. I'm desperate for someone to tell me it gets easier, has anyone here encountered this same feeling? I just need a little reassurance, it's hard accepting my body is growing and I still despise my body despite having the most wonderful partner of 3 years, my confidence is getting worse the more weight I slowly put on.Sorry if this isn't the right place to post, it's just I'm a little desperate. I have other mental health issues Im worried could resurface if I don't find something soon. (Also my one active parent does not believe in eating disorders nor that there's ever been anything wrong with me so parent support is not an option).Thanks.
