 Things you wish you did when you were 18Hello, I’m a fairly new poster I’m quite foreign to the forum so forgive my ignorance. I wasn't entirely sure where to post this. I’m eighteen years old…male. I’m in my final year of secondary school, the leaving cert is a little over a month away and I’m in the phases of entering into adulthood. I very much so have a lack of direction in life…I’m not really sure where I’m heading or what exactly what I want to do. I was wondering if you were 18 again, what things did you do/ wish you did that would benefit you now?For example: Study, Learn an instrument, or learn a language. What advice would you give someone starting off in life? What lessons and morals have you learned?Thank you,A.
