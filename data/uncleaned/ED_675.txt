Looking for some supportAt the moment I'm living at uni, away from my family. It was against the wishes of my clinic therapist that I returned to university, as she had made a request for me to become a patient at a hospital, but at the time it was the most important thing in my life. Eventually I managed to persuade my parents and my therapists to let me come back to uni, and be seen by a new clinic here. Recently I've been struggling quite a lot, my grades have been dropping, I've not been coping very well and I'm pretty miserable. I feel like university is supposed to be one of the best stages of your life and I feel as if I am wasting it by spending my time here in such a bad state.The past week or so I've been considering taking the advice I've been given and taking the space at the hospital that has been suggested for me. This means leaving my friends and taking a break from university but maybe it's for the best? Really I'm just looking to see what other people think at the moment, any advice?ÊI'd also be interested to know about the general experience of being an inpatient so I'd know what to expect? Thanks
