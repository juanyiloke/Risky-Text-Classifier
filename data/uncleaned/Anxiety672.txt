Meditation a good idea?I've been thinking about meditation for my anxiety/panic/hypochondria/etc but I read all this stuff on meditation causes induced depersonalization and derealization so now I'm scared to try it because I already have the fear of losing my mind and get depersonalization and derealization so the idea of bringing it on through meditation is horrifying so I really don't know what to try to get better because everything seems flawed
