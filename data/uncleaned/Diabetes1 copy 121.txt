MODYI was diagnosed with Glucokinase MODY a few years ago and other than during pregnancy I have required no treatment just monitoring. However my cholesterol has taken a sharp increase and they are talking about statins to control it. This is making me think that it could be the beginning of the condition progressing and I want to do what I can to support my body through weight loss and healthy eating.I have never spoken to anyone else with MODY and was just hoping to hear the experiences of others with the same condition.
