ÊGender Identity Issues and BPDHi, I have been struggling with this for awhile now, and wanted to know if there was anyone out there who could relate, or if this is a common BPD problem.My gender identity seems to shift with my fast changing moods. Normally, when I am feeling more stable, I take on a more feminine self (I am a woman). I am interested in wearing dresses and heels for a short period of time, but this never lasts long. Most of the time, I feel as if I should be a man, and when I am feeling particularly reckless I often feel very strongly that I am indeed, a man. But I also can feel somewhat stable and like a man. The shifts confuse me, because while I often wish to change my gender, sometimes I pull a 360 and feel like a total woman again. However, if given the choice to be a real man, I always would say yes, because most of the time I do want it.So anyone have similar issues? Is this a common borderline problem?Thanks all!
