Health App ChallengeI hope you might interested in helping me raise awareness of, or take part in the Health App Challenge.In this challenge we are supporting people (of any age) to design and develop their own apps (mobile apps and websites) that they think will be helpful for diabetes (T1 and T2) or weight loss surgery self-management. We are also inviting people to review these apps (as well as any other apps they may have used for diabetes or weight loss) for feedback to developers and to inform peer app users. This is all conducted through our website atwww.healthappchallenge.org.ukPrizes are awarded for taking part and we offer technical support, intellectual property advice, health professional input and for those not confident in app development, an option to submit mock-up/storyboard designs instead of or before developing an app.The project is run by Plymouth University, funded by the Intellectual Property Office and supported by Diabetes UK, WLSInfo, HandiHealth and Britians Nurses.To take part and for more information please visit our website atwww.healthappchallenge.org.uk or email me atemily.ashurst@plymouth.ac.uk with any thoughts or queries. Thank you
