Today I am 55...I should be celebrating. No, not going to happen. I do not feel I ask for much in this life. I feel I am always the giver. I am going to end this life today. It is not just the money problems. I have two daughters. I love them both so much. My older daughter and I have a pretty good relationship. But she has her own problems and issues. I am estranged from my younger daughter. It is tearing me up inside. I have tried talking to her, texting her and emailing her. I can see she reads the messages. She is just not giving me a chance to even try to fix the problems, or talk about them. She will not let me see my grandchildren. I feel like my heart is broken. All I wanted for my birthday was to have them back. It is clear that will never happen. I have everything I need. I just have to go home. I know this will not fix the problem, and will make it worse, but I miss them so much... family members know what is going on...no one stands up for me. So tired...
