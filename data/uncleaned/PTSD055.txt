Looking For Psych Tool InspirationMy situation is that clearly I am tied to the father of my child for a long time. He was horribly abusive sexually where he would act out violent towards me on top of just being a prick that does not respect me. (no it did not start out that way) He constantly writes me off, writes off the abuse unapologetically and really does not know how to be a father, rather a playmate which does have some good points but he neglects guiding and teaching the child. I keep finding myself stuck in the past he now refuses to acknowledge however we discussed rape situations online and in the past with a counselor. And despite needing medical care for these- hindsight was to late to actually press charges to keep him from further financial manipulations and getting joint custody (which time wise he still falls short on - but you know with this guy its about the money anyhow) He nearly brought me to homelessness last Christmas of all times refusing to repay a loan and I had to move due to physical attacks at my mothers - having lost time at work and jobs again due to his abuse. Things financially are doing fine now and there is more security- but I continually lash out at him verbally usually via text as I try to spare my hatred for this person from my child. I know its not right- its not going to change the past. And I look like the fool in the end. I struggle with going to doctors and educational professional having to be civil when I don't want to be around him as it is a trigger. But somehow I have to make a leap. Any ideas that could prove helpful? (for instance I had to see him yesterday and the physical flashbacks of strangulation returned the night prior)
