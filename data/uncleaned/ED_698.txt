underdeveloped bodyHy fellas,First of all I'm sorry for any bad english. I'll do my best!Since I have beaten exercise bulimia and anorexia, I have an idea wich I can not let go: I feel and think I have an slightly underdeveloped body, compared to my peers, because of the past overtraining and under eating. Pubic years/teenage years are important for dudes for growing muscles and specific masculine body features, and I think that I reduced that growth. Don't get me wrong, I'm more satisfied with my body then anytime before, and I managed to put on some muscles the last years, but I feel quite bad because of the effects of the years of pushing myself to the limits. The permanent knee-damage only feeds the idea that I destroyed a natural, attractive body, wich I want to compensate with a lot of powertraining now to grow some muscles. It works I suppose, but not for every body feature. And the sensitive knees demotivate me for going to the gym. I accept that I was in a disorder and that I forced myself because of it, and I have to live with the consequences. Sometimes I say to myself: "I don't care what the effects are. I'm going forward." But I can't just pretend to be happy and satisfied. Please share your comments, opinions and idea's about this.cheers
