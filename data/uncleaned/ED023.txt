Relapsing post treatmentI decided to move a discussion I was having with forum members from the "Males & Eating Disorders" forum under the topic, "Would like some advice" to this forum as the discussion has gotten somewhat long and has definitely changed topic. I want to first thank Hannahls for your responses and support. In response to your most recent question, no, I can't bring myself to get rid of my "sick" clothes.As is suggested by the subject, I believe I may be relapsing. I want to loose the excess weight that I gained while in IP/RES and PHP programs, and the only way I know how to do that is to return to my previous behaviours. I have begun to restrict and many of my ED symptoms are coming back.To make matters worse, I saw my dietitian yesterday, and she informed me that she believes I am "going downhill fast", but I haven't lost any weight. This, of course, confuses me.I know I don't want to go back to treatment, and I know that what I do is not exactly healthy, but it is what I know and what gives me my sense of control. Has anybody been through a phase like this post-treatment? If so, does anybody have any advice to give that would help me stay recovery-focused and combat the feelings/need to loose weight? Thanks.
