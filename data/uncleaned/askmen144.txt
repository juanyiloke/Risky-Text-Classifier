Dont know whether to join the armed forces2012-01-16, 04:25 PMHi guys can someone please help i'm in a pickleI'm currently studying at university and thinking about whether to join the army after i graduate i've done all the possible research you can image, visited the army career centre and spoke to friends/family but i still dont know whether it is right for mesometimes i go off the idea and forget about joining the army but the thought is always at the back of my mind. i have never really been career minded and am only doing a degree because i thought it was just something you did after college.I dont have much confidence and am quite shy just want to find a passion in life and do something that means something if that makes any sense.Êany guidance would be great i just want to get my head around it thanks
