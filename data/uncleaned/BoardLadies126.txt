Things you would like to see invented to make life easier for us womenfolkI treated myself to a massage today, and after 10 mins of shuffling around trying to get comfy, the same thought hits me that always hits me whenever I get a massage. Why does someone not invent a massage table with boob holes in it? There's a hole for your face so why isn't there one for your boobs so they don't have to be all squished and uncomfy. I'm only c cup and it's painful, so I can only imagine the pain of the massage table for big breasted girlies.So that is my little invention that would make life a little bit easier for women kind, the boob hole massage table.Anyone else have any good inventions they would like to share?
