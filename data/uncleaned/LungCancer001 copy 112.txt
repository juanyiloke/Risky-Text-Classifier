Should I be worried?I don't know whether to worry about this or not..I have recently been to the doctors with the following issues, persistent cough, breathlessness when walking and occasionally when sitting still, wheezing practically constantly right now, fatigue, pain in my right shoulder blade and tingling sensation/numbness in my left arm. I am quite prone to getting chest infections and pneumonia so I assumed it was just that. The Dr said that there is no sign of infection so he put me on Prednisolone to help my breathing but recommended I get a follow up with my GP ASAP. I went to my GP a couple days later and she seemed to be concerned as this has been an ongoing issue for about a month and a half now. She has sent me for an X-ray which I am still awaiting the results for. She also had said she is concerned about Lung cancer and COPD. My concern is I have now finished the course of steroids and since then all the symptoms have got substantially worse. I woke up in the middle of the night struggling to catch my breath and I can just walk from my desk to the kitchen at work. I have started getting pains in my left ribs also. I'm only 21 so I wouldn't think it could be lung cancer, but I do smoke and I'm concerned and not sure whether to go back to the Dr's before I get my results as the problems are getting worse by the day.Any opinions would be great, thanks.
