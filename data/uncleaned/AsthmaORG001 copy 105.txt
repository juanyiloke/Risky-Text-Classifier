Difference between breathlessness, and an Asthma Attack? Hi all,Newbie here. I'm taking a few days off at the moment, after I almost fainted at work.This was after I cycled into work, and was breathless and coughing for 10 / 15 minutes. The thing is, I thought that I was just trying to catch my breath after a hard cycle in, I didn't realise (until something obviously was't right), that there was something a bit more going on... I'd turned white, shaking, pins and needles in arms, high pulse, that sort of thing. I guess my question is, if you're sometimes used to be being breathless after exercise, how do you tell the difference between being whats normal and something more like an asthma attack?Andy
