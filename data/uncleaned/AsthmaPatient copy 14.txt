Persistent Cough at Night, is it Asthma?  2  I was diagnosed asthmatic 2 years ago at 51yrs, after hubby complained about my night time coughing, But I've never had a wheeze, but I do sometimes feel and hear something in my throat, like there is phelm stuck, like a clicking noise? I also sometimes get out of breath just going upstairs, some days worse than others. I have recently started to cough really bad again and I'm not sleeping properly as a result, I'm coughing up both white phlem and small white balls of phlem, I take Seretide 250 night and morning x2 puffs each time and this makes me cough? I use Ventolin more now 4/6 times a night and that does not irritate me but doent stop me coughing for long? I'm fed up and very tired, keeping everyone awake! Is it Asthma or something else?
