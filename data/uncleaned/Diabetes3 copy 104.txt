Looking for a little handHi Guys - I'm new to this site and I only stumbled upon it doing some research.I do not personally have diabetes myself - however my baby sister does (Shes not quite a baby anymore - she is 18). We are members of a local voluntary group and have been for twelve years. Fundraising for Diabetes holds a great big part on my heart and I do as much as I can. I am currently in the middle of setting up my own support group for teenagers with diabetes to allow them somewhere to meet and do things that they want to - within reason. But also to allow them to support each other - a bit like this fourm.Now here is what I really want to ask you!! I am a 4th year student at Uni doing my dissertation. My dissertation is on whether or not the voluntary sector can address the limitations of the medical support given to those patients with long term medical conditions. I have one main question and it would be great if you guys could answer it?How do Voluntary Heath Groups Assist Patients with Diabetes? (I guess this fourm could count as a type of Voluntary Group). All answers would be greatly appreciated. I am just trying to gain an insight. Thank you Linda x
