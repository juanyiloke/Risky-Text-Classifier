Memorising stuff. just rote learning?by kelefiHey all, im currently in year 12 with AS exams fast approaching and I want to do a degree in medicine, but i have a simple question;can i just get by with rote memorisation, i.e. just reading it, trying to commit it to memory then moving on? thats what im doing for biology right now, but i dont know if this will be effective when im at an advanced level, so (mainly directed at PostGrads, who have a lot under their belt) can i just get by with reading something and memorising it or not?what are some better memorisation methods? e.g. for memorising DNA replication.thanks
