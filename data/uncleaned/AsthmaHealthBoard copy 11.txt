Does this sound like asthma? Need advice, very confused________________________________________Hi everyone, hope everything's well. I've been hopping from forum to forum trying to figure out what's wrong with me for months now, and finally I landed with a neumonologist and he suspects asthma (awaiting spirometry)The problem is, well for one I'm very ignorant about asthma, and my assumptions about it were totally different from what my symptoms are, so I've come here trying to find out more.First off, I thought asthma was supposed to not allow a person to breathe or at least make it extremely difficult. While for me the main symptom is breathlesness, not obstruction.I'll be having a conversation and feel like I just sang an opera all by my self and need to stop before I get seriously dizzy and short of breath. However, there's no dramatic obstruction going on. Just the fact that I cannot hold a conversation like a normal person. Some days it gets so bad I sound like the boy from Malcolm In The Middle (any fans of the show should know). Basically I'll say a word or two, rest, say a word or two, rest. Ironically, that character was supposed to have asthma but I never made the connection. I just thought it was weird that I sounded like him LOLAnother thing is that while I do wheeze it's neither super loud (usually very quiet) nor constant. Sometimes I can't hear it (although in complete silence I'll usually hear SOMETHING). This is not what I used to associate with asthma, though.And finally, I'm still not convinced I have asthma because I haven't had any isolated type attacks, which in my mind this is what I thought asthma was: Isolated severe attacks. My symptoms have basically been constant for the last 3 months or so (it's summer where I live) and do limit my activities a lot, including my ability to talk!So I was told that my asthma is probably Persistent and Moderate. Does this sound about right or should I be experiencing isolated attacks in order for this to be asthma? I do have a history of getting winded as a teenager but it did not interfere with day to day life, it only limited some activities like running competitively, and actually singing used to get me winded as well but it's fairly easy to avoid singing for long amounts of time!I suppose that this history rules out any "acute" conditions for my dyspnea (seems like the same disease that affected me as a teen has progressed). My first thought was to see a cardiologist, but she found nothing on the ECG, that's why I'm doing lung testing.I also suffer from exzema and hay fever which I've been told is part of an allergic triad that includes asthma. I'd really appreciated if someone can share their thoughts and tell me their opinion about whether this sounds like asthma
