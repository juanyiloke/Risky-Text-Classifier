Itchy itchy, very itchy!Hi all,Has anyone encountered intense all over itching which drives you insane? I have just had some blood results back and have been told my diabetes is poorly controlled. Am very disappointed as I've been eating healthier and even lost weight over the last couple of months. My blood sugars seem to be pretty good for a while then suddenly go totally haywire.I still haven't asked for the test to see if I'm LADA, something I keep meaning to do, but just wondered if anyone else has had this crazy skin itching issue? Am unsure to whether this is due to my diabetes, as all other tests came back fine.
