Recommend a hairspray?I wear my hair in a style similar to Justin Timberlake's, the product I'm planning on using once I get around to ordering some is American Crew Forming Cream, as I was very impressed by it when I got my hair cut and the barber used it in my hair. However, It's fairly common for my hair to take a beating on any given day, I'd happily bet Û100 with anyone, that if I left the house without hairspray in my hair, it would be messed up by the end of the day no matter what product I use. So I'm in need of a hair spray. Up until I changed my hairstyle, I would just use any random hair spray, as I used to have a faux hawk and the finish wasn't too important. But I've noticed it makes my hair very crusty once it's dry and ruins my hair completely, and I don't even use much. Does anyone have a suggestion for a brand of hair spray which will keep my hair up all day without ruining the finish? Also, does anyone know any reliable sites to order American Crew products from?
