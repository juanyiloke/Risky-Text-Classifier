  5th anniversary of the day I should have diedI should have died on Monday, December 14th 2009. I was foolish enough to seek help at that point; made things far worse than they had ever been previously but I had to stay alive so my friend would do the same. I am still here today to do everything I can to give her the life  she deserves. I have no more desire to live than I had back then but I'm making a positive impact in her and her baby boys life and that makes it all worth it. As long  as I have the means to help her, I will continue to live, for their sake. I thought about the upcoming anniversary a couple  of times last week but I was working  today and forgot for most of the day until I was done with work . I guess that's something to view positively...
