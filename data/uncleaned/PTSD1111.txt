I have ptsd from growing up in an abusive home. Anyway, I used to have friends. During the last several years, I just became very isolated. I don't have anyone to really talk to outside a handful of myspace friends. It's difficult. I don't have a lot in trust in people. I tend to prefer female friends because my abusers were male. However, I think it's very important to have some male friends too. I'm in my late thirties now and making friends seems completely difficult! When you're young, it happens kind of naturally--a lot of people are single and want to do things as a group. I find it hard to decide what to do to get out of my predicament. I'm also a little worried that people will recognize that I'm a little bit edgy and sometimes not so comfortable! I do worry sometimes that other people will see me when I'm a little spacy and kind of emotional. That idea has prevented me from trying to make new friends in the recent past. I'm going to have confidence. I'm a good person, so that's not a problem. I have tended to stick with people in the past that haven't treated me well. That's just something that a lot of us have probably dealt when we come from an abusive environment. I want some suggestions on how to make new friends that I can actually do things with and don't live in another state!
