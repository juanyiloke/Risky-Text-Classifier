ÊDoes this sound like Anorexia? Because I'm not entirely sure...Okay so, I'm almost 20 now and have been underwight for almost my whole life. I don't think I'm fat, and I've never in my life struggled with that, in fact I've always known I'm a bit smaller than other girls. I've never admitted this to anyone, but the fact that I'm so thin has always kind of felt nice - like when other girls would complain that they had a few kilos over, I'd be like: Ha, don't have that problem. I'd also like to mention that I've never not eaten on purpose or for that reason, you know to be more skinny, I just sort of didn't eat. Sometimes I'd forget, or I'd be too lazy to get up, or the food tasted like cardboard to me. Once before my very first date I didn't eat for 3 days, just because (I see now that maybe I did it unconsciously or something, I mean it feels like too big a coincidence). I don't really WANT to gain weight.... But I get really scared sometimes that I'm actually anorexic and I'm gonna turn into one of those girls that get hospitalized or something. I read up on this a bit and another explanation might be depression, I have been under a lot of stress for the past couple of years (might not seen like much, but high school and college are really hard and stressful). What do you guys think, should I go look for professional help or not (asked for a nutricionist once, but my mother told me she wouldn't pay for something she can tell me herself, that is - just eat more)? Like I said this has been going on for a long time and I've never improved, actually over the years I've slowly started losing more and more weight. Honestly, I don't know. People always told me I was anorexic, I always told them to shut up because I wan't. So, yeah... advice?
