TravelMy partner Rich has said to me this morning as soon as i feel well enough in my recuperation he's going to take me to Spain for 3 nights this has given me a huge boost. Do I need a letter from hospital saying that i am a person with diabetes and does anyone know how much time you need left on your passport? For example we are thinking of going in May and my passport expires Sept 2015 so there will only be 4 months left on there for travel and in the back of my mind you need 6 months or have i dreamt that up?
