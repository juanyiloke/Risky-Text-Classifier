I've been going running off and on during the last couple years. I'm not in tip top shape (5'11" and 195 pounds) but I have no problem with most physical exercise. Running may be an exception. Nine times out of ten, I can only run for about 700-1000 feet at a time without slowing down to catch my breath. Part of this is because I run up and down hills but it also happens on flat ground. Other than being out of breath, there's no other bodily signs that I need to slow down. My muscles don't feel overwhelmed or fatigued. Never had an asthma attack, but I often develop small amounts of white mucus in my throat. The mucus is different from normal phlegm because it's stringy and sticks between your fingers. In addition to the mucus, saliva also accumulates in my mouth forcing me to spit frequently, but this is much more common during the winter months. Lastly, my chest feels like I'm carrying around a few extra pounds of weight where my lungs are located. That's the best way to describe it. The above happens to me nine times out of ten. Once in a great while I can run intervals twice as far on the same course without slowing for air. My breathing is a lot less labored. I have no idea why because the weather conditions are almost identical. I'm curious what you guys think before I see a doctor about it. They don't always listen the best, so it might be helpful to have some knowledge beforehand.
