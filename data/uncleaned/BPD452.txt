ÊJury serviceI was called for jury service (in the UK) weeks ago and not heard back yet from my response on the form. I cannot cannot cannot do it. Am really bad at the moment and struggling to make ends meet as a freelancer. I told them about BPD, anxiety, self-harm, agoraphobia and everything but... no answer. The date is getting closer and I'm just panicking. I'm ****ed if they make me do this. Has anyone else been through this? They fine you £1,000 if you don't turn up without "good reason". I'm about £25,000 in debt (inc student loans) so wouldn't be able to pay it! I wouldn't last five minutes in prison.Ê
