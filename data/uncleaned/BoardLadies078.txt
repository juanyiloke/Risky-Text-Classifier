The sisterhood? Where ma ladies be at?I just heard a guy refer to 'the sisterhood'.I'm female and I'm nice and friendly can I join?ÊNow what is it? Does it exist?I know there are some universally female things that we go through and share. But not all women do. And I definitely consider trans women very much part of the sisterhood.So like what is it.I have heard the term used rather pejoratively.ÊThe 'sisterhood' as I see it is rather inter-sectional with a lot of different races, backgrounds and perspectives.ÊBut generally when I hear it used by men it's as if it exists purely to be against men not with any characteristics of it's own with nothing to do with men or sexism. I think what I am saying is the perceived 'energy' or female vibes whether you are trans or cis sexed, black or white it's there I think. It can be strong or softer.ÊI dunno I just wanted to get a discussion going.What do you think? I am guessing most women never really think of a sisterhood to be honest.I have too many wonderful male friends for it to be exclusive....We are all brothers and sisters umkay hippie vibes...
