Any advice/experience of this? Nursery tell me constantly what a champion little eater my DD is. You'd never know at home - if it's not banana or toast then she's not really interested. I do all the right stuff - give it to her, watch her chuck it about the room, take it away without comment - but she's been a picky, can't be bothered eater at home since we started weaning. I often eat with her but it doesn't really make a difference. Any advice? Or failing that, any thoughts when she might grow out if it. She's 13m.
