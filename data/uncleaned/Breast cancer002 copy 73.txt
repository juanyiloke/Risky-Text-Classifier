LadyCare Menopause Magnets¥	Hi, everyone - have read quite a bit on the above subject so thought i would give it a try - well what a difference.  Having best nights sleep i have had in ages - 6hours in one go which is unheard for me at the moment.  Am not being woken up with the night sweats but when i do wake up i find i do have a hot flush but can put up with the odd one.  I am now only on Herceptin injections every 3 weeks.  I only started waring the magnets 13 days ago but so far so good - well worth the money :)¥	Keep as fit as well as you can be :) x
