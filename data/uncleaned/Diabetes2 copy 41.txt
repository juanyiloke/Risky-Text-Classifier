need opinions  6  i have been diagnoesd w T2 for about a year.  my a1c was 7.  Over the last 3 months my BS has been excellent.  One day I woke up with severe neuropathy in both legs from toes to hips.  i had no symptoms prior it was a sudden onset.  is that possible? doesnt neuropathy start slowly and work its way up over time? Dr suspected more was goin on and ordered mri where it was discovered i have several hyrniated discs compressing spinal nerves & they are suggesting surgery.  my question is how do i know this is not diabetic neuropathy & def my back?
