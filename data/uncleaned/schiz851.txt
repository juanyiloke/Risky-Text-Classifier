it's madness for the village, on Santa's day of no return; Captain Fantastic at play, captain of the time-play called "consciousness", brought to you by "awake", a disaster of desire - these days it's rocks on the floor and rocks in the sky, big load of consequences and dreams under a balloon of free will going south on it's mission of salvation, that mission to let everybody go..... go monkey breath, go faster while time is a certainty, and you haven't brought all of heaven out, yet. go before the turkeys get there, cause danger and turkeys walk side by side, walked one door past forever on the time calendar in the kingdom of human knowledge, slipping past their expiration dates like champions of suicidal tendencies and improper human outliers in the darkness. Get lost on turkey days, and nights can be left to the great beyond; don't dance with the turkeys, and don't talk about 'em; I'm countin my chickens on the way into town, cause nothing comes twice anymore not even life, so go to sleep or count to 5. -(W)onderdonk(ey)
