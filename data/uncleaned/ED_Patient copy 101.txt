PLEASE ANSWER ME...I WORRY ABOUT MY FACEHi! My name is Nan. I am not English speaker, but please I need your help.I’m 23 years old now. I have had Bulimia since I was 14 years old & I stopped vomiting at 20.6 years of my life I stuck my fingers down my throat 15-20 times per day.The question is I think my face is bigger than I should be.I mean I did it when I was so young. Would my fingers expand my face shape?Would it make my face bigger? I did it very young & My body didn’t fully develop as an adult.I see the dental braces can shape the teeth so why my finger couldn’t expand my face shape?Please I need an answer. Someone please help. I worry about it very much. Thank you in advance!THANK YOU VERY MUCH
