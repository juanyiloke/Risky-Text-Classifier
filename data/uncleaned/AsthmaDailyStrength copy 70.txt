Names Jason and am 31 lifer with Asthma. I was diagnosed as a child and have had Chronic Asthma ever since. I am on the maximum amount of medicine for Asthma my Dr feels safe putting me on and still having tons of issues. I also have a disorder Samters Triad. Polyps grow and block my sinus cavities or continue to grow and move down to other parts of my body (throat, brain, cheeks eyes etc) I have had 11 sugeries due to the triad. The triad makes my asthma ten times worse and lately every day literally 24 hours a day I am struggling to breathe correctly. What can I do? I am getting depressed about the situation and not sure what to do. The Dr's are at a loss, they tell me my lungs from a lifetime of asthma attacks are that of an 80 year old. :(. I just need someone to talk to. Any suggestions you can give me to get my asthma under control would be a great help. Look forward to replies thanks in advance
