Private Photo Exchange EtiquetteGot into a discussion (argument) today with a male friend of mine today.I, and most people I know, think that once a relationship (or fwb agreement) is over, the correct thing to do is to delete any private or explicit pictures of them, especially if you are entering into a new relationship.This male friend of mine thinks it's ok to keep those pictures, even when in a different relationship. I claimed it's worse than liking or saving shirtless selfies of an ex-boyfriend on Facebook/Instagram, to which he got annoyed at.Am I wrong to get slightly worried/annoyed by this? Publicly available content (like adult films or Page 4) is one thing as the person supplying it is aware and consents to it. But normally people share these things with either a partner, or someone they are interested in, and once that bond goes, surely they wouldn't exactly want the receiver looking at the photos for weeks or even months afterwards?
