the maskI wrote an earlier thread that had to do with how much i hated myself and the main question was "how can you make a deep connection with someone new when you hate yourself?"- the main answer was basically no, that you have to 'learn to love yourself'.i hate myself because of my depression. And i feel like most of my depression and aunguish stems from me believing i was stronger then i really was and feeling that i didnt need help from anybody.an example of this would be when i was on my way to compete in a national tournament for NSW and when i was about to leave i was told that my mother had died, i was 17 at the time. I remember being told that i could stay or i could go, and thinking that i was strong and could carry on i went. This is the first time i remember really wearing the mask as i did not tell anyone for a week what had happened to me and instead played with the team... I normally wear this mask all the time nowadays with my friends with people i meet, i dont think that when you see me you would think that i have chronic depression or that my self esteem is through the floor.Basically what this thread is about is me asking for peoples opinion on this mask i talk about, is it good (because i can make connections) or is it detrimental (because it prepetuates my feelings of depression because i keep it all bottled up)?
