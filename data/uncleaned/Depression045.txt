Ups and downs Born with a congenital cataract, in the early 1960's... my parents were assured that once the cataract had "matured" removal would be fine. Jump to2015, after my lifetime of referrals and passing the buck around... still the same.Now, I know (nowadays) that intervention has to be in formative years, but I am rather royally miffed off being stuck with Êduff eye, when it could have been mended. Bang goes my career in the RAF. I served my time in the NHS. ÊNow, in my dotage, my ex bosses and the DWP, will not acknowledge or recognise a disability .Are they turning a blind eye? ÊI have always been bumping into folks, heard all the sayings "are you p""""d, watch w'ere you're going, are you blind ,etal.We are out there,we Êmanage, but sometimes we get tarred as drunks and druggies because we try our independence.So....I have grief, my mad ups and downs, sometimes I can see them coming"
