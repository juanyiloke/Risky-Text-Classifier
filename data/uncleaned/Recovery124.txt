Reminders - Opportunities - Scary!Getting ready for the workman today has shown what an awful state I've let my house get in. It is an opportunity to clean and sort some things out as I put things back, and to sort out some things for Ebay or similar.I'm also coming to terms with my deteriorating financial state and planning to cook more of my own food etc., sell a few things and monitor exactly what I spend. I'm not used to having an overdraft.I think the ABs are starting to work, but I do have what may be a mild form of CFS, so need to be careful.
