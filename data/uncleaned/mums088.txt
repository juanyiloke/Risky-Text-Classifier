Does anyone else have an extremely stroppy 4 year old? DD1 has turned into a monster. She has terrible tantrums all the time and we never know what will set her off. Frequently she starts screaming at us because one of us 'looked at her!'Lately she has got out of the wrong side of bed virtually every morning and will scream and scream, demand things, change her mind, scream and scream and can't stop. Or she won't talk to us properly except to say 'mmm' in a very aggressive way and expect us to understand her and then go off on one when we don't. All of the conventional advice for tantrums we have tried - and nothing works. If we ignore her, she will just keep going. We live in a small flat - there is nowhere to hide.Sometimes when she just won't stop I sit on the floor in front of her quietly and that's the cue for the abuse to begin. She'll kick, punch, hit and scream 'I hate you' and 'mummy's a poo and a bogey and a toilet' at me. Basically using whatever insults she can.Dh has more patience than me - he used to be able to distract her out of it sometimes but not lately.She's always sorry later - or says she is - but we are at our wit's end. It's got to the point that I actually don't want to be around her and that's not the relationship I want with my daughter, who I do love very much. We are what I would describe as 'firm but fair' with her - we don't just give in and let her have her own way all the time and I wouldn't say she is a spoilt brat. She is obviously struggling with the fact that things can not be the way she wants them all the time but this is the way it comes out.Thanks.
