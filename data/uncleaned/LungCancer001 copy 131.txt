  New here and scared to death...Hello, I'm new to the forum but feel really blessed to have found this site. Today, I had a PET/CT scan to determine whether a 1.2 cm nodule on my left upper lung is malignant. I am 43, non smoker, single mom who had a bout with pneumonia in early April of this year and that's when the nodule was found. I have been experiencing constant dull aches in my left arm, shoulder and upper back, slight burning sensations in my chest and occasionally in my left breast. I'm not to sure as to why I would develop this type of cancer but I can't be to pretentious and think that I shouldn't because no one should ever have cancer. I guess I just need some thoughts and or experiences to be shared. I'm awaiting the test results now...waiting is the hardest part...
