Issued Verbal Warning________________________________________Long time poster here but staying anon.2wks ago there was an incident in my work and, to cut a long story short, i was given a verbal warning from my manager, i signed for this as i was partly to blame. During the meeting she kept on saying that i was going to be sent to HR and that it wasn't looking good for me.This was my first ever warning after 8 1/2yrs service.My question is this, after getting a verbal warning for an incident, is it legal to be given further , and harsher reprimands from HR for the same incident?
