I cannot believe and its not quite diabetesHello EveryoneI saw the Surgeon today and OMG and Deo Gratias  he doesn't feel I need to have the second hip done immediately (althoug initially it was the 'worst' one').  he was absolutely delighted with my progress and we did the exercises together which was fun!. I will see him again in February but if I have any pain in right hip then I can contact him.Now all I have to do is get back to my usual fairly good control for a HbAic and Cholesterol Test in November.  Wish I could remember what my Beneden Magazine said about Dr Briffa (and that was only this afo LOL) - it sort of said he was contrary - I know I laughed but seriously I think he was seen as a bit of a God can't think of the workd but really a completely alternative medic.  Also they decided Diabetic cholesterol should be under 4.  I'll never get there!.  Seems to me that thresholds for all tests are being slated.  What the hell is wrong with this country.  Are they trying to scare us to death or is it that they can earn more from us by scaring us to death?    Or perhaps the pharma companies now have the upper hand.
