fishing rod licence.I think the increase of £4.50 for a concessionary rod licence is outrageousHow on earth can the overpaid men in their"ivory towers"at the environment agency justify this amount of increase for pensioners when a standard licensehas gone up 50p, Have we been got at by "Buster Brown and his little Darling.?to claw back the pittance of our pension increase,MY hobby is angling and i dont mind paying to fish, but this sort increase is extortion!!
