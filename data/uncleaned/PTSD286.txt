Flashbacks and some kind of body memoryby charlotte23 » Tue Mar 18, 2014 5:52 pmI was attacked about a year ago whilst barely concious and I now have flashback of it and some kind of body memory down below like arousal like a sexual reaction. Does this body reaction mean that I was raped and its my body recalling it somehow, or is it just because I felt like I had been attacked that this happens. I wake up all panicky and have to wake myself up properly, so I know I am safe and then go and find someone to talk to until I feel calmer again. Sometimes I wake up crying and all sorts. The other month I had top go to hospital for an allergic reaction, but as I was confused and disorientated, when they asked me to change in to the gown, I freaked out at the thought of removing my clothing and when I saw the doctor was male, I just signed myself out in a complete panic. I know that might be irrational behaviour, but I could not help it, I just felt anxious and not safe.Where do I go from here, as I don't want to keep signing myself of hospitals due to this, can a doctor help me in anyway at all. Any replies will help me greatly.
