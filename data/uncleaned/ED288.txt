ÊPlease help, I feel so alone and completely hopeless. A combination of being underweight, parent problems, and moving out?I really have no one else to go to, so I'm resorting to advice from strangers online. Here is the situation in a nutshell. PLEASE don't tell me I need to "get better" and "gain weight", etc, that is not what I need. I've dealt with anorexia for several years. My parents have supported me and put me through treatments. I finished an inpatient treatment 6 months ago and was "restored". I also got serious treatment for my depression. I have never felt better. I feel alive, ready to go back to school, continue with my job, interests, etc. I have, however, lost weight. I am considered underweight right now, but I love it. I am NOT obsessed with food, I don't starve, I don't do any damaging behaviours. It just kind of happened on its own. But I had tests done, I am physically FINE. Why should I gain weight? I don't care if my bones show. I feel great, I love how I look, I can function, I finally feel alive. I am 22 years old, I can decide what to do with my body. I love my parents so much, and I hate seeing them so hurt, but I honestly refuse to go back to rock bottom and become depressed and suicidal again by gaining weight and worrying over food. With that said, I'm looking to move out. It's terrifying and uncertain, and I don't know what to do. I can't go on like this. I love my parents, and know they love me, but they need to know that I don't WANT help, I don't WANT to be force-fed like a child. I've been crying for the past 48 hours...I am so lost....
