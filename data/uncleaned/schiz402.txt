Êgetting the right diagnosisi have been diagnosed with so many diagnoses its ridiculous, i have always got my care through the public health system as i cannot afford a private pdoc and phs pdocs are not the best. I take fluoxetine and seroqouel and had my olanzapine stopped. They have been throwing around schizophrenia (but i dont hear voices) a lot lately but the dr said bpd but i did what they said and researched bpd and bpd sounds nothing like me. I am an extreme loner, only relationship in my life is my mum who i talk to every couple of months, i dont want people in my life, problems when i was in hospital recently for being suicidal and what they said was psychosis, i was suicidal cause i was sick of the governent plotting to kill me and feeling nothing and the pdocs were jealous of the special things i can do, i feel like i can have my thoughts taken away and take them from people and am too freaked out too tell my pdoc about all this and it goes on, any help or advice appreciated
