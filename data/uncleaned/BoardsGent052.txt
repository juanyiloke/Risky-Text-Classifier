A good gentlemans' tailorCan anybody recommend a good tailor? You know the kind who can tell what brands will suit your build as soon as they see you. Knows their fabrics etc. Actually interested in making a sale.We have been looking over the last few weeks for a grooms suit and the service we have been getting has been really bad (louis Copeland an exception to that). Himself went on his own yesterday and the shop assistant tried to convince him to buy a suit that clearly did not fit. Some others have been completely unbothered. Spoke to a chap in brown Thomas who said he'd come back to look after us and never reappeared. I know its sale time but we are getting a really bad impression. we are fairly easygoing people with money to spend on the right suit. Himself is tall and very thin so we just need to find the right brand for him.(sorry if wrong forum for this)
