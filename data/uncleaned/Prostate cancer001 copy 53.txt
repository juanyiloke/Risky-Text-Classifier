HDR Brachytherapy treatment experience Dear All,I underwent HDR Brachytherapy treatment on 19 Sep and on 21 Sep wrote a detailed post of my experience to benefit others either considering or about to embark on the treatment. After writing a page and hitting POST all was lost and I got a message saying I wasn't connected to the forum.I can't go through all the typing again but if anyone has specific questions, I'd be happy to share my experience.Best wishes with your respective journeys.
