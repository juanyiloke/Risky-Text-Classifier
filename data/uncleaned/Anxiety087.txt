Anxiety physical symptoms bothering me Ê7    Hi Everyone,I'm sorry if this is TMI, but I don't know what to do! So I have anxiety sometimes and I think it leads to me always having to go number 2. Even if I feel an ounce of anxiety, my stomach gets uneasy and I feel like I have to go. It has been an ongoing thing since my major anxiety started. I think I have read in the discussions that this is fairly normal, but I feel like it gets in the way of my every day life. I don't want to feel this way almost every day! I just wanted to know what you guys think about it, like should I go to the doctor, can they help me, or should I not worry about it so much?Thanks!IBS or colon cancer Ê13    I am 35 Êyears old male from India. i was diagnosed with gastritis which was cured by Triple therapy.
