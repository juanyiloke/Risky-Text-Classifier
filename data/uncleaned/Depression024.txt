my husband thinks that ignoring me will make it all go awayPosted 9 months agoI have disc and nerve damage in my lower spine which has led to Fibromyalgia, I also have Menieres Disease which is a vertigo and balance problem. I take amitryptoline and citalopram to help with the pain and for helping me to cope with long term cronic pain. Those are not the problem, my husband is. He spends most of his time upstairs in his room. My son is my carer but there are things he cant help me with, I feel I cant ask my hubby for help as he spends most of his time ignoring me or sulking because I spent money without his say so. I cope well with my conditions but I cant cope with how he treats me, he says he loves me but how can he? Don't want to live but know I have to.
