Topic:ÊNightmares and unpleasant dreams - how to cope?ÊCancelFor a few weeks now I have been having nightmares and unpleasant dreams all through the night, usually more than 2 a night. I get to sleep at a decent hour and wake up completely drained and in a terrible mood.A lot of them I don't remember yet they've put me in a bad mood all day. Sometimes its about people from work, if we had a fight or they said horrible things to me or about me. The dream felt so real its hard to forget the fact it was a dream. Which makes me analyse over everything they say to me and how they say it.On top of this, my nail biting habits have gone a bit far. I have been biting the skin on my fingers to the point they bleed. Its an unconscious habit that I'm finding hard to stop.I am seeing a therapist next week (first time with this person), which is making me nervous, which will most likely fuel these dreams and habits.A month aloneI have had depression as long as I can remember. Its gotten fairly bad the last few months. I am on medication but haven't worked up the courage to see a therapist (I have many times in the past but I never connect with them)My boyfriend who I live with has just gone to America for the month of April. It has been one weekend and I feel desperately alone.ÊMy co-workers tell me Ill be fine if I have my friends over all the time. Truth is I have no friends, my boyfriend is my only friend and he is gone.To sound like a crazy cat lady, we got 2 kittens before he left as company for me. I don't know what I would do if they weren't here and it was just me..
