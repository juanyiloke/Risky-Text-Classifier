Update on my jaw pain, stress and drugs situation.¥	Hi folks¥	As some of you may have seen I developed a problem with my jaw. I've had a lot of pain with it over the last six months. At first we thought it was due to the Tamoxifen, but it turned out that wasn't the cause after coming off it for 8 weeks. ¥	The cause was stress during the chemo phase of my treatment. I ground and clenched my teeth so much that it put my jaw muscles under so much tension that now, after visiting a jaw specialist, have been told I have cramp. ¥	Good news is that it doesn't need any surgery. The best thing to ease it is to apply heat 4 times a day.¥	Bad news is that I've now got to ease myself off tramadol, gabapentin and lorazapam. I've been on these to help with the pain and I've been told, and had some experience myself that coming off them is very difficult.¥	We're seeing my GP tonight with a plan to gradually come off them.¥	All this is due to being stressed.¥	If there's anything you can do, or are offered that relieves stress, please grab it with both hands. It'll really help you in the long run.¥	Good luck with the battle and take good care of yourselves.¥	Mike xxx
