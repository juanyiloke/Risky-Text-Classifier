Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipadus   Has any one been perscribed [b:ca1af7c319]Chlortalidone [/b:ca1af7c319]medication for [b:ca1af7c319]Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipadus,[/b:ca1af7c319] if so I would like to hear from you as my son has been on this medication for 2 weeks and he is feeling very weak and ill. I see from the write up on the medication that it is used for [b:ca1af7c319]Diabetes Insipadus [/b:ca1af7c319]but no mention on, [b:ca1af7c319]Nephrogenic,[/b:ca1af7c319] if you know any thing about either of these conditions you will know that they are differant conditions from each other in as much, 1 is to do with the putuary gland and 1 to do with the reseptors on the kidneys.If anyone can give advice, I would love to hear from you.
