Help i have a problemi used to be anorexic but then recovered, been good for a year, i moved and highschool stress started an emotional eating problem, then i started to abuse laxatives. now its a constant battle everyday. I dont know if i can keep up anymore. I just feel depressed and i am tired of it. It is so hard and i have no one to talk to because my parents think i am recovered. I cant talk to them about it or i will be put back into treatment again :(
