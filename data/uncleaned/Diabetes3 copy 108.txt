HbA resultsWhat with the depression and, the various health scares and illnesses I expected my HbA to be bad but I was surprised when the surgery's new DSN told me it was 58 (7.5), I expected it to be far worse given how badly I've been taking care of myself. BP, a bit too low, cholesterol a bit too high, toes/circulation fine. Weight down another 1.5 kilos, which makes more than 12 kilos since last October. On the whole, not nearly as had as I feared and I was impressed by the DSN, she really knew her onions and was very supportive of me once I'd explained what was going on. I still have to see the consultant next month about my insulin regime, but with a properly qualified DSN nearby, I'm happier to let the surgery handle most of my care. A very nearly positive experience.
