ÊHow did U have your wedding? Do U mind share your big day story and the proposal?Hi, just a positive thread.I'm a newlywed, 3 months into marriage. So I have alot to learn from all the marriage couples out there. Those who are married for long time or currently married. If there any marriage tips you can give, it be greatly appreciated.And do you mind share your wedding story? Like did you have a wedding reception? How many guess invited?Was both side of the family give their blessing? Was the wedding planning stressful?I didn't have a wedding, we both just decided to get married. So I guess I want to hear other people experience in their wedding planning and their big day.And how did your husband propose to you? Or how did you propose to your wife? Please share your happy moment proposal story.I hope these questions are not too personal. I apologize if it is.
