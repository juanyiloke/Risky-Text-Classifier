Gents who use urinals: How do you live with not wiping your weiner after peeing?Spun off from a discussion on After Hours a few days ago.Am I the only one who always uses the cubicle to take a piss when he's out? I've only recently begun to consider that my friends, and probably also the toilet guys in my favourite nightclub who know me very well, probably assume I'm either struggling with chronic constipation or snorting coke every hour or so when I'm out on the piss Essentially, I pee (standing) in the cubicle and then get a bit of toilet roll to dab the end with after I'm finished. If I fail to do this, a couple of drops leak out afterwards when I'm walking around.Now maybe some lads just don't have this problem, or maybe some don't mind a tiny damp patch in their jocks, but I for one literally can't stand it which is why I haven't used a urinal since I was a kid. And when peeing outside, I always find myself a leaf or something to get rid of the aforementioned dreaded drops.How about the rest of ye? Is there some magic trick other lads use to avoid this problem which has somehow eluded me for all these years, or am I simply more anal (penile really in this context  ) about hygiene than others? Maybe the odd drop or two doesn't bother anyone else?
