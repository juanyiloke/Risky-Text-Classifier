Is attractiveness objective or subjective?Just something I was thinking of when browsing through a different thread. I think as a Man I can make an honest appraisal of my own attractiveness and also how attractive members of the opposite sex are.Where does preferences play into this then? For example someone might find someone of a different ethnicity or darker features more attractive than someone who might be touted as more "conventionally attractive". When I say conventionally attractive I'll use Rosanna Davison for example. She won Miss World, is obviously very good looking, and she represents what it is to be beautiful to a lot of people.ÊSo what is attraction? Is it simply great facial symmetry? Why do people from foreign countries sometimes have more of a "wow factor" attraction wise? Is it just because it is slightly different to the norm and thus more interesting?Interested to here different peoples thoughts on this.
