Time off for job interview________________________________________Hi! I have a job interview in two weeks time. I really need to do the interview as things were so stressful in my current job that my G.P. wrote me off for two weeks. I told my manager that I had a medical appointment on that meddate as I did not want to tell him I had an interview. I offerred to come in early, go to med appt/interview and then come back and work through lunch to make up time. I also offered to take a day's holidays, but none of these was acceptable. The interview date can't be changed. I feel like my only option is to ask G.P. for letter for appointment. G.P. knows how dificult things have been in work, and that I need to get a new job. Any ideas a?nyone
