 Anxiety and universityby sweatpea_98I am going to be applying for university in September/ October time this year and recently I've been feeling very anxious about everything...1)I have no idea what I want to do, and I keep changing my mind and I just can't decide which just worries me that I will end up doing nothing2) I don't have work experience and only one thing lined up the summer(hopefully more soon) and I'm starting to panick about what on earth i will write in my personal statement?!3) even though it's over a year away im thinking about what university life will be like with anxiety and meeting new people and the social life which I'm not really in to....I sure I'm worrying over nothing but the applications are creeping up quickly and it's been making very anxious the last couple of days :/ just need some advice on the what to do.. And wondering if anyone can share their experience about having anxiety at university
