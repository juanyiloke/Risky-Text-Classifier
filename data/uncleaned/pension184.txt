Treatment of Old PeapleI got a free ticket on the internetFor a live TV recording of a quiz show in SalfordI wont mention the name but it involved university studentsI was the oldest person there with my grey hairI am not the handsomest of peoplebut in the past have persuaded 3 ex wife's to marry me.A lot of people were thereI was to watch two half hour showsAnyway got a good seat in the frontFor me it was going good.Until:They wanted an audience shotI was told to move from my chair by the Woman directorso I would not be seen in the audience shot How embarrassing and upsettingI was the only person asked to do this out of the whole audiencefor me anyway I complied because I have always been law abiding.Watched the second show at the end the director pointed her fingerat me and flicked her finger to one side for me to move out of the chairlike I was a dog so I would not be in the audience shotI moved out of the chairThe director saidWe like You  but we Don't Like your HeadI left in hurry I was very upset
