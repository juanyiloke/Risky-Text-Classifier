Hello,ÊWe have a family holiday booked for June-myself, my husband, my mum and dad, their foster daughter. Our son will be 7 months when we go. Accommodation is our villa. We are yet to book our flights.ÊI really do want to go but just feel so anxious about how my son will be. I really don't want him upset by waiting at the airport and being on the plane. Is 7 months too young? (London gatwick to turkey).ÊI'm also worried about hand luggage- will I be allowed to take his bottles? Pureed food?ÊChanging his nappy in the tiny plane toilets?!?ÊI know I may just need reassurance here as my mind does tend to go over the top. My mum and husband have the opinion that it will be much easier as he isn't walking-it's when they want to get up which is difficult. I do understand this but still I'm anxious!ÊAny advice/experiences would be so appreciated. Thank you!
