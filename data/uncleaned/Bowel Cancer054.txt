Loperamide, Codeine Sulphate, Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline, & other medicationsLoperamide, Codeine Sulphate, Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline, Mebeverine, Audmonal, Oramorph, Fybogel, Psyllium husk and LactuloseI was diagnosed with cancer of the rectum. Unfortunately the join made during the operation failed and the join wasn’t water tight (leaked) and also became infected. It healed after many months but it’s now narrow, contains scar tissue, and as a result I’ve experienced more problems than the majority of people who go through this procedure.Despite the operation being several years ago I still have issues with bowel control, and also pain where the join is. Not one to give up here is a list of the medications I’ve tried so far and the results.I’m writing this case be you find yourself in a similar situation. These drugs may be suggested to you, or if you think they may help in your situation you could ask your GP/consultant if you could try themMany I’ve not had success with, but we’re all different and what didn’t work for me might well work for you, it’s worth a try!
