Diabetes and Diet on BBC Radio 4 Food ProgrammeThis was broadcast today at Sunday lunch preparation time, and will be broadcast again on Monday afternoon at 3.30pm, or you can listen on iPlayer athttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05rl3jbIn addition to presenter, studio panel consisted of a GP / broadcaster, dietician, Simon O'Neill from Diabetes UK Careline, and another broadcaster who has lived with type 1 diabetes for over 30 years. There is an out of studio segment in the kitchen of a woman with type 2 diabetes.Worth listening to whole programme, as there have obviously been considerable efforts to consider the whole topic fairly and comprehensively.__________________Copepods are rather cute, small, aquatic crustaceans - I'm a tall normal weight female human, who has worked with marine invertebrates and humans (not together!)
