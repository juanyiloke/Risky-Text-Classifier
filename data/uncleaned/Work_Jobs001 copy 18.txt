	Sick for week and got threatened________________________________________Basically as title says I was out sick for a week with a chest infection and gave a sick note from the doctor for it. I was walking to get parts and met the boss. I said hi and he pulled me up being out and I sai well I Gave a doctors note and he said" I couldn't give a flying fcuk what you gave. Your costing me money and wasting my time."Then he told me I'm a useless pr”ck and a waste of time and energy and I'm only a fcukin headache to him that needs to be got rid of. These are his exact words and I wrote on a sheet the date and time and his words given on a sheet in case something happened. I've made a mistake or two in the job but few and far between. Yet he throws this at me and starts being abusive towards me. Then he threatened me of my job saying he wants me gone and that he's going to tell my supervisor if I out a hair out of line I'm gone. All this came from me being out sick. Is this allowed despite the fact he is the owner.
