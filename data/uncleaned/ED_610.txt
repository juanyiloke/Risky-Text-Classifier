Recovery meal plan advice.Hi there!I am in self recovery and really could do with some help about what a healthy meal plan looks like- the thing is, I am average weight, so do not necessarily need to gain. I just want to eat normally! I have no idea what normal looks like?!I understand I cannot post what I am currently eating- although is there a way I can get this reviewed? If someone could PM me? I would like someone to take a look at what I am doing and see whether it aligns with plans their doctors gave them etc.Ashleigh
