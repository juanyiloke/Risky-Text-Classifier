ÊScared *possible trigger warning *Hello,ÊHaven't ever posted on here.ÊI've had AN for 10 years now. I have been sectioned twice and 10 admissions. At my very worst I was unable to sit up and talk in intensive care, and forcibly tube fed for months before being transferred to an ED ward. After literally tripling my weight and absolutely freaked out. I live alone and feel myself desperately wanting to start losing again, but I know once I start on that slippery path there's no stopping me, and I'm not sure my body can take that again. I've already defied the odds and survived when doctors said my organs were failing, losing my vision and I was about to go into a coma.ÊAnyway, I've got to the point where I can't stand the sight of myself and my ED is screaming at me to do something about it. I feel like such a freak and can't go on another 10 years like this. Any advice on how to stop going downhill again?!?!ÊThank you for taking the time to read, and advice is much appreciated.Hugs to all.
