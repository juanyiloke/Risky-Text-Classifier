Êreporting a historical crime *** trigger warning***Sorry. I really don't want to trigger anyone reading thus and I truly apologise is advance. My head is full of the most awful thoughts and,in addition, I'm considering what my CPN mentioned yesterday.ÊStuff happened when I was younger which marked the beginnings of my mental health problems. It begins with the letter A but I can't say the word because then it feels real ... But I ended up with 14 years of a serious eating disorder but, after years of thinking life was normal, I had a major trigger about 4 years ago which led to complex PTSD, a return of my eating disorder and a dissociative disorder where I have an 8 year old in me. And this trigger relates to what happened to me age 8-10 and I'm hurting and I don't know how to handle it. And if this wasn't enough, I was attacked seriously in a park aged 19 and I can't say that word beginning with R but I didn't know this person and I had already had an incident in the high street aged 16 where i was sexually molested bit the police couldn't find him. And I wonder what I've done to ask for this. And I'm not coping and my CPN said how I could report the age 8-10 stuff and have it registered and acknowledged by the police but I don't want it investigated as I am scared but I don't know know whether he went on to do it to others and I don't know how to handle these thoughts. And even if I do, I live in a different county and don't know whether I go back to that county. And my CPN is wonderful and I have trauma therapy but I have these thoughts in my head and I don't want to live in my head. And I don't know what to do. I am so sorry for being me. So sorry. What do I do? :'( I have awful flashbacks, nightmares and I disassociate and, as you'll are in my other post, I am holding down a demanding full time job and family and other things too. Tired. Tired. Tired. Tired. TiredGecko x
