ÊNo One Takes Me SeriouslyI keep talking to people about suicide. Both doctors and friends... but no one is doing anything! I know the fact that I keep saying I want to do it and then not following through must make it look like some cry for attention, but that I wouldn't actually do it. In some way, yes, I'm crying out. I am practically begging people for help. I would not tell someone I wanted to kill myself if I didn't want someone to help me. How many more ways can I beg for help before someone takes me seriously?When you hear things on the news about people killing themselves and how nobody saw it coming... I just find that hard to believe. How many people tell someone they want to kill them self, aren't believed, and then follow through with it? Why isn't this taken more seriously.ÊI'm honestly at a loss, I do not know what else I can do to get help? I can't keep telling people I want to kill myself if they're not going to listen. It's getting to the point where it seems there is no help, no getting better. It's getting to the point where I'm thinking suicide really is my only option.
