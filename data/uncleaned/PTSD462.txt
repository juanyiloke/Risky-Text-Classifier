ÊNewly DiagnosedI went to see a new T today and I was discussing my conditions and situations and when we were finished he pulled down a book from his shelf and opened it to the pages for PTSD. He went through the symptoms of the condition and every one of them except a couple pertained to me, from the feelings to the outbursts. Strangely enough, I was relieved by the news instead of thinking oh great this is bad. I have been told in times past that I was only ADD/ADHD and not bipolar, PTSD, Manic or depressed, just ADD/ADHD. The idea was that I was just wanting attention from where ever I could get it. This bothered me because it seemed stupid to me to only get attention by feeling this way. I now believe that my PTSD has caused many of the hurts in my life and I now feel like I don't have to feel weird for my actions, I need to take responsibility for my actions but I can say that they are assisted by my PTSD and not just by me wanting attention. The doctors of the 1980's and early 1990's were wrong. I feel better knowing this and hope that I can recover from this past of guilt. This is more of a rant than it is a question or wonder. Thanks for reading any comments are welcomed. Thanks again.
