Ênegative judgementsEven with the most loving and caring of people, I still feel like they think badly of me - I think this is my inner critic? but projected outwards?Its just that with everything I do , there is some negative judgement and I think everyone hates me or thinks badly of me. This gets in the way of me being close to people, and from experiencing pleasure. I think it comes from when I was young and my mother used to be highly critical. It gives me a bad feeling inside - like I'm scared to write or even think about certain things incase it triggers it off again.Has anyone else got similar issues?ÊThanks,
