Dating AgenciesHi just want to give people heads up on dating agencies - not the online ones. Seemingly can't give the name!! I joined one a year ago after seeing them on tv. They interviewed me for an hour on my likes and dislikes, my personality, jobs etc. my specifics in the gentleman I would like to meet! The deal was 500 euro for 5 very professional dates! They seemingly take all the hard work out of finding Mr. Right. After the date they would contact you and if you and the gentlemen were impressed with each other then your numbers were swapped and you could pause your account for maximum time of three months. But you could unpause at any stage!! All sounds too good to be true.ÊI took the plunge being 36 and after trying everything else I said why not!!Unfortunately my first date was horrific. The gentleman was rude, what I had been told about him was all lies. It was the longest hour of my life. I was totally humiliated and had to drive an hour & half back to Dublin after it. I felt our names had been pulled out of a hat and that's how they put us together.ÊWhen I rang the company they gave out too me and told me that I was the problem!!My next date was lovely a gentlemen but unfortunately for me the company never rang me to find out how it went. I finally rang them and they informed me they hadn't realised I had been on a date 2, some excuse about computers been broken down etc etc. they promised they would contact me back immediately once they made contact with the gentleman but still nothing.ÊWhat I'm trying to say its a big waste of money and please don't join them. They are extremely unorganised and not a bit helpful or nice. Don't believe the adds.ÊHope this is helpful to people thinking about joining. Spend your hard earned cash on something nice. Unfortunately for me I can't get anything back..
