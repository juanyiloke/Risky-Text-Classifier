Eating disorder, cant deal with it any longer...Hi, so i have been suffering from an eating disorder this year and i finally got checked up about it in July and have been trying to gain weight, but i am experiencing some of the worst side effects. besides the mental ones, such as depression and anxiety, i have been having terrible constipation, the worst bloating ever and that constant feeling of feeling full. i have gone from eating 850 calories a day to 1100, to now about 1500-1600. is this still enough to gain about 4 kilos in about 2 months? i need some tips, advice, stories, pelase! has anyone else gone through this and had my side effects and have tips on how to rid bloating and constipation. ive tried laxatives, prunes, etc.
