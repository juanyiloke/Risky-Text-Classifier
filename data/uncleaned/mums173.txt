Hi, would really appreciate some advice and success stories pleaseI have a 7mo DD and 2 year old DS. DD is currently in with us but is growing out of her crib and her cot won't fit in our room, so I'm hoping to move her in with DS soon.He is a good sleeper, mainly sleeps through the night but we do have some crying when we put him down. DD still wakes at 11 and then 5 ish for a feed. I'm happy to continue the 11pm, I'll just wake her before I go to bed, and I'm hoping she will drop the 5am feed soon.ÊRoutine is nappy, teeth, pjs, and fireman Sam for both kids. Then DS gets a story in bed, while DD is bf to sleep. I'm hoping I can just bf DD while reading to them both, then they go down at the same time in their individual cots.ÊAny tips, advice? I'm really nervous about doing this.Thanks in advance
