Feeling MiffedI've had clinical depression for 36 yrs very badly at times but more stable over the last 4 yrs, even though I suffered ive always been very positive and go lucky type of guy to hide the upset. I feel that i'm on my own with my health though the only time I get any support is when i'm hypo (not often), and that's from my young daughter (16) I've been with my wife 24 yrs married 22 and I don't think she's ever paid any interest in my type 1, I wont give all the details ill be here forever, but she couldn't do anything with a pump like bolus or put in a temporary basal rate or even tested my blood, she's just not interested. When I told her about my next pump there was just a really disspondant Oh! its just as if its your issue deal with it, it really is a depressing issue for me as although I deal with my Type 1 some support would be nice  Ive got you guys and the clinic I suppose that should be ample but loved ones are important especially on something like this.My question is how do I go about educating my loved ones without scaring them and making it seem a chore
