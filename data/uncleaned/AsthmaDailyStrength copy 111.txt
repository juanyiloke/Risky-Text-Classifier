I've been battling a cold since Saturday. It's made my asthma really bad so I've gone to the yellow zone on my asthma action plan. My medications are doubled and sometimes I take benylin complete. (cough suppressant with mucus thinner) Today, despite the extra medication I have chest pain, dizziness and persistent shortness breath. Even the extraventolin doesn't seem to help for long. I have really bad allergies and take reactine. I've taken the full dose of it today. Is there anything else I can do? I don't have a nebulizer and I want to try to avoid the ER if I can. I really don't want to go on prednisone again.
