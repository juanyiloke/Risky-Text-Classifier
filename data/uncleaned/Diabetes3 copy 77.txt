Been quiet for a whileI don't think I've exactly been "missing" but I've certainly been a bit quieter than normal for a while.I think I've got down to the bottom of some of my issues, I've had some pain in my abdomen since last year which most nights I take some paracetamol to help me sleep. After a few rounds with the Dr we are fairly sure it's some kind of muscular damage, probably caused by the little one grabbing my side and shaking me strongly about 6 months ago! Although a 13 year old mattress wasn't helping - so that's been replaced.Apparently I'm also full of gas (maybe I should become a MP?  ) and I've been struggling to get it out of my system. That's probably caused by the Metformin (which makes you gassy) interacting with the lansoprazole (which keeps it all in). But the lansoprazole is keeping my heartburn in check.Diabetes wise, because of feeling unwell I've taken my eye off the ball fairly horrifically. I'm about 4-5 kg heavier then where I should be and my levels are running higher. I've set myself a target of until June to get that back in track.Although, I'm not testing half as much as I really should (only once this year so far) - so if any of you want to nag me about that - please do
