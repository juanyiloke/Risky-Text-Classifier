Êalter talked at therapyI'm a bit freaked out at the moment and things are a bit weird in my head. It's only in the past few weeks where the identity of the different parts of me having become clearer, more defined, named. And I found myself talking as Kate in trauma therapy today, talking about a younger vulnerable part, S. I could see S in the corner of the room who was playing with some toys and I wanted to protect S. S is very vulnerable right now. But, the psychotherapist and I were able to have an adult conversation and all I know from previous sessions over the past 18 months is that I lose my sense of being an adult and that I go quiet and I'm scared and I feel little sitting in the chair and very childlike. Today I wasn't the same person. It was the first time that I could see that child, separate from me, playing in the corner. I really would love S to be happy and am desperate for her to be safe X
