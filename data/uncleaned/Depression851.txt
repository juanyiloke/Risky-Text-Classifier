ÊToday's Doctor AppointmentI wrote like 10-12 pages about my life and such to my doctor because I suck at verbal communication. He said he'll read it and we'll talk about it on the next appointment. I was already taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg for Depression. Trazodone didn't help, so he discontinued it. He prescribed Prozac 20mg (Depression) and Doxepine 25mg in AM, Noon, and twice at bedtime (Anxiety and Insomnia). So my current medications are Wellbutrin, Prozac, and Doxepine. Anyone else have experience with Prozac and Doxepine?I had a panic attack earlier because I didn't have enough money to buy my medicine, so I borrowed money from a family member.
