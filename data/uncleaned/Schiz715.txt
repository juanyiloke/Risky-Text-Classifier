ÊAbout my voicesI don't know what I have but I hear voices. It doesn't happen every day but when I focus too much on them, I can hear them. When I keep myself occupied, I don't hear them. Since I have calmed down, I haven't heard them in weeks. My boyfriend suggests that I get help but I worry that the help I will get will be inadequate. They might just give me meds and that's it. I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life. They don't scare me and I'm used to them. They sometimes annoy me when it's really bad but most of the time, I don't hear them often. Will they get worse? Is it worth going to the doctor about it? I prefer self help and trying to control the voices by relaxing and calming myself down. I'd would rather prefer them to transfer me to someone who specializes with people who hear voices. My moods are stable but sometimes I can get too excited but I guess that's normal. Apart from that, I feel fine. I don't know what else would be wrong with me.
