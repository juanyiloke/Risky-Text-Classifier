Body OdourLooking for some advice ladies...It's getting to that lovely time of year - heat, sunshine, walks, holidays...and body odour.ÊWithin ten minutes of showering in the morning, I start to perspire to the point of smelling. I've tried a multitude of approaches - strong deodorants, antiperspirants, medicated antiperspirants, anhydrol (which caused a very painful rash). Trust anti-odorant, which worked for a while.ÊI thought I had found a winner in Pirtok Crystal spray which has worked for the past six months until about two weeks ago.ÊThe problem is at an embarrassing stage, where I 'm actually thinking about bringing a change of clothes and having a shower at work in the middle of the day. I want to wear a sign that says, I do actually wash!ÊHas anyone found a solution that I could try? I'm dreading the thought of summer.
