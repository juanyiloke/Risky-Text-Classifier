just invested some $$ into a business with a bud but now regretting it..2012-04-10, 12:21 AMWe started a computer/portable electronics device repair service business and ever since the buisness start up about a month ago, it has gone really slow. And now I am in a diliema worrying that we won't even make enough to cover the first month's rent. Since I have basic computer working knowledge and my buddy had his computer repair business 2yrs ago ...I thought this may lead to high potential because we can start working our way with his exsiting customers.ÊSo far most of them have no issues that calls for our service and same time I'm been putting ads into local newspapers, internet classifieds, and passed out company fliers to offices in our building. Weeks gone by and no calls just some small jobs here and there ...most of time spent at the company office is doing nothing but marketing research resulting without earnings at the end of the day. I'm getting worried cus just have this dreadful feeling in the pit of my gut that the thousand I've invested is flushed into the toilet as where our business is going so far.....Behind every success there are screw ups.
