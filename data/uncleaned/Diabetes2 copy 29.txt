Very high blood sugar  4  i was diagnosed with diabetes 2 and a bit years ago but it was treated by diet alone until this summer. I am now being treated with metformin sustained rsleazemg 2 tablets per day. I was told nt to take my blood sugars regularly as it would worry me too much except for 2 weeks when my prednisone was increased from 5 to 25 mg per day one week before and one week after a cataract operation because I also have an inflammatory eye condition called uveitis On average during that time was blood sugar was 14 and the doctor w as not worried, said not to continue monitoring blood sugars. However, today, I was not feeling at all well so took the blood sugars anyway and it was 30.4!! Went to the doctor and he told me blood sugars often go up when you have diabetes  and an inflection which I did not know. I have actually got two   Infections - bacterial urine infection and viral throat infection. Is it true that it can go as high as that and not be dangerous?
