DS is nearly 2, I would love a 2nd but DP is worried about space. We have a 2 bed flat which has big bedrooms but its unlikely we would ever be able to afford a bigger place ( we got a very good deal) especially in the same area and I like the location.ÊI would be happy to put 2 kids in bigger room which is ours at the moment and divide it when they are older for more privacy but DP isnt so sure.would it work for us to stay here with 2 especially if DC2 was a girl? would it be ok to divide a room for teenagers? How can I talk DP into it?
