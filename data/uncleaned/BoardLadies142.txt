How long did it take you to get over a bad breakup?Hello ladies  2 weeks into a bad breakup and have been thinking, what was your worst breakup and how long did it take you to get over it?Over it meaning you don't compare every guy (or girl!) you meet to him (or her), you properly fancy other people again, you don't think about him all the time, you stop being so apathetic to life And does it get easier or harder the older you get? I'm 26 and this is the first time my heart has been smashed to smithereens  We were only together properly for 1.5 years but ouch, it hurts bad. How do you distract yourself and move on?Let the inspirational stories begin!
