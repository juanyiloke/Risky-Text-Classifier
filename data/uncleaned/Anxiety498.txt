I need a little help this week. Anxiety back...Long story short I am in my 40s and have had anxiety for as long as I can remember.Ê Panic attacks, etc.Ê For the last year it seems my anxiety level has been higher than ever.Ê Maybe because I am a dad with 2 young kids and a lot of responsibility.Ê I sort of started worrying about my health.I have been lightheaded most days with dizziness that seems to always get 100% better when I am very distracted, exercising, or having a couple of beers.Ê I could literally feel like I am falling over and then run for 40 min on the treadmill without a problem.Ê I mean, I can literally have to hold on because I feel spacey and lightheaded, yet jog and be ok.Ê So, I chalked that one off to anxiety.This past week I have been super anxious about a dumb lump in my throat.Ê So much so I even scheduled an endoscopy!Ê Well, the symptoms went away, but not without a significant fear that this was something bad.Now, my arms and legs are like jelly.Ê 5 days now.Ê I feel like my arms and legs are weak.Ê Almost disconnected and not my arms or legs.Ê If they're not weak, they're sore and ache.Ê But, I can go for a 40 min workout without trouble!Ê 15 min after I am done the feelings return and now I am fixated on it to the point where I just was driving and it felt like my legs were going to give out on me and it was hard to depress the break.Ê Panic started to set in.Ê I got out and walked briskly to the store and once more calm, the feeling mostly resolved.I type this now in fear and my arms/wrists are sore, yet weak.Ê I feel jittery and on edge.Ê Of course, this raises the fear of MS/ALS.Ê That is a new fear I discovered this week watching someone with that disease in a wheelchair.I don't know what to do.Ê I am so frustrated.Ê I know I have OCD and anxiety, but despite years of panic and symptoms, each time I feel like I am battling it for the first time and I keep thinking "it is different this time, something must really be wrong."Does this all sound like anxiety?Ê Should I be more concerned?Ê Thanks everyone.
