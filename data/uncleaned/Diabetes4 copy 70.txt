Annual Review with GP NurseI have an "annual review" with the nurse who deals with the diabetics at my GP surgery tomorrow to review my medication. I've already had the blood tests and done the BP check etc.  I've never had one of these since being referred to hospital and going on insulin. I've always seen the hospital instead and the results and letter have been sufficient to let my GP tick all their boxes.  Does anyone else have these with the nurse at GP surgery? I'm not sure what to take with me or what to expect. Can take my diary or libre printouts, but i'm not sure how much GP nurses known about carb counting / adjusting insulin ratios.  Anyone have any experience?
