I was diagnosed with PTSD about ten years ago, but I can remember praying to God to let me come home when I was about seven years old. Do you remember Jenny in Forest Gump? Well that was pretty much my childhood. Unfortunately, I never had a kind Aunt or Grandmother to take me in. I hate when people say it was an event that took place a long time ago. Every Christmas Im reminded that I am alone. Every morning I am reminded. Its a never ending experience of not having emotional attachments to other human beings. I don't know how to make friends and I am told to "put on a happy face". I don't even know how to fake this. I don't feel happy, and most of the time I don't even feel sad. I just feel tired. I went to a free counseling center for about a year, but it didn't seem to do anything but rub salt into it. The first counselor was a kind and sweet girl who would cry and I didn't feel comfortable burdening her. The second didn't let anything bother her while she ate a sandwich or put drops in her eyes for allergies and the third and final one said that I was making this all up for attention. I rarely allowed myself to get angry and this was probably the first time I was so angry, I couldn't think. I finally understood that expression about seeing red. I just don't know where to go from from here and how to pay for it when I get there. Any recommendations would be helpful. Thank you
