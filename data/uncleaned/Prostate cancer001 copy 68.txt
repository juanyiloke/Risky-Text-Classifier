Any experience of Template biopsy Has anyone any experience regarding template biopsy?   I am 60 years old.  Diagnosed July 2013 with a Gleason 6 and PSA 8.3, and also with an enlarged prostate.  @ October 2014 my PSA is 11.4 and the consultant wants me to have a template biopsy to see if Active Surveillance is still a viable option.I am unsure whether to go along with this or just to admit defeat and go for a radical prostatectomy.  I've read that template biopsies can cause problems and complications during a prostatectomy and if this is going to be inevitable in the next 2 years I'm wondering if I should just go for it now.Has anyone any experience of this?
