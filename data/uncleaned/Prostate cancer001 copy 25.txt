Mustn't grumble! Oh well, I'm now 10 weeks post my open prostatectomy and now back at work.  I saw the consultant for the histology last week who said basically that they had almost got all of it out but there was just a small amount (literally millimetres) left.  Gleason remained at 3 + 4 and he confirmed it wasn't an agressive form of PCa.  He got a blood sample taken and my G.P. has told me that that has come up as a PSA of 0.03.  I've got my 3 month PSA due on 16/12.On the one hand, I'm a tad sad that there is still a bit left, but on the other hand, I'm pretty relieved that the PSA looks like it's going in the right direction - with all the usual caveats of 'for the time being', etc.Guess I just have to sit it out and see where this goes ... if anywhere, and take what action becomes necessary, if, as and when it does.Meanwhile, I rather feel l need to try to get on and deal with other issues in my life.I do feel a lot better psychologically for getting back into the daily 'structure' of working life. I'm really not - and have never been - a very patient patient. Life is a journey. You can't move forward on a journey AND stay in the same place.
