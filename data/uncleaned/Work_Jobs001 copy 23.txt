Is this blacklisting?________________________________________A particular job is advertised, the role is very specific, it requires a certain set of skills...Numerous persons with these set of skills are applying for these jobs, but none get the job, the job goes to someone with 75% of the required skills, the hiring manager says they will not hire from qualified persons applying, because they like to mould the person, therefore always excluding perfectly qualified persons. Is this blacklisting, in other works if I work in the same role for another company, I will never be successful in applying to this company because I'm qualified for it?
