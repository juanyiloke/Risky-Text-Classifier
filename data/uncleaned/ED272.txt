 Anorexia since I was 16I have had anorexia since I was 16, now I am 23..and I CANT get out of it...There are good days and bad days..but still I obsess over food..My parents have already give up on me.. we are not so rich to afford all kind of support (medical and physiological) for me..Back in time when I was 16 and my BMI was very low.. (before I was a normal girl,) I had sessions with physiologist..but that was all..I have tried different meditations..I am into spiritual stuff...But not even that could not help me...My only obsession is my BODY..when I would gain weight..I would cry ... Just there is no way out..I have had concentration problems very long time, my studies are affected due to that..and I am moody and I get sick easily..In the past I have goals and I knew what I wanted to do in life...now for about 7 years all what I thinking is that my body should be and look nice...all the time...I am not content with myself.. my mother has always been overly critical towards me..but even acknowledging that and every day saying to myself that I am beautiful and healthy etc...does not change that thoughts about the food Usually my day starts with a big cup of coffee..then another cup..(around 8-9 am)Usually eating fruits or one sandwich.. (if I am eating...there are days when I am only drinking coffee)Skipping lunch...or eating a little nuts and fruits..or a vegetable soup (still it does not happen very often) (around 12-1 pm)Dinner.. yogurt..or salad usually.. I like chicken and fish too..( around 3-4 pm)drinking coffee..Fruits or one sandwich..or fruits..usually fruits.. (around 7-9)Drinking lots of water 1-1,5 liters in a day.I like water and herb teas.I like outdoors sports - walking, cycling, jogging etc..What should I do?I cannot afford any doctors right now...Thank youTake care
