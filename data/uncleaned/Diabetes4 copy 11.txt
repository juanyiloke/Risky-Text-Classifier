How to secure the Freestyle Libre sensorsHubby had this great idea and it really works!  I was moaning that Opsite peels.  Told him that this new sensor needed a round piece of paper exactly the size of the sensor so that if the opsite peeled I could rip it off without pulling the sensor out.  So he used a mug about 5cm diameter larger than the sensor and cut out a circle from Opsite, he then put the bit of circular paper in the middle of the circle and helped me apply it over the sensor.  The Opsite doesn't peel at all! Despite several showers it is stuck fast!  Cut a circle....
