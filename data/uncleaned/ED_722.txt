Changing the pill...Hi :)I've had an eating disorder for a long time - years before I started using the contraceptive pill. Last september I had managed to reach a healthy weight and things were looking up. However, when I started the pill last November I think it increased my appetite a lot and led to weight gain. This then led to relapse, weight loss, etc etc and it's been very cyclic since then. I've developed really awful depression since then too. I did have a mild depression during my eating disorder before, but this just seems so different and kind of unrelated to food.I'm planning on going to my doctor when I'm back at uni to see if I could change pill. Looking at the evidence now it seems obvious that that's what has caused my relapse into depression and ED.The thing is, I'm terrified that changing the pill will make me gain more weight, or develop acne, or make depression worse. I have this fear of change. It makes me so paranoid!I guess I just wanted to ask, does anyone have any experience with the pill and eating disorders/depression/weight gain? If I did start a pill that made me gain weight, would I lose it again if I went off it? For the record I am on Rigevidon and have been since I started the pill.Thank you so much. xxxxx
