Asthma?________________________________________For years I have had bouts of breathing difficulty off and on. Nothing in particular sets it off, I can be doing anything at all or nothing and suddenly feel like my breathing is restricted, my throat gets a tight feeling and I just can't seem to get a breath in, then I feel like I over breathe and get light headed. This happens at random times, but I can go months with no problem. Usually it returns every spring as it has this year. I get a tight feeling in my throat and a feeling of a lot of mucus int he back of my throat, but have no wheezing, no tightness in the chest, no coughing, just a problem breathing and it also seems certain positions I turn my head it is like it cuts off my windpipe or twists it shut. I can't seem to get answers, last time I brought it up with my Dr they wanted to send me to get a scope down my throat. No insurance, so that didn't happen. It can happen daily for months and then suddenly be gone for months. Does this sound like asthma? or something else?
