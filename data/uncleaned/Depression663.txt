big row with my mumStarted by njr?, 21-02-15 06:36 PMHi everyoneAs people may or may not know i have seperated from my wife and moved in with my mum and dad at their insistance.I have spent most of the day in bed feeling comfy and relaxed listening to smooth fm. Drifting in and out of sleep.When i got forced out of bed i have been accused of taking drugs and drinking whisky in my room (i have found comfort in spirits before) because its "not normal" to stay in bed all day.I feel like sh*t now.???
