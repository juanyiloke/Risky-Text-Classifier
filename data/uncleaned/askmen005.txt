Has anyone been promoted over a former supervisor who becomes subordinate/2014-06-20, 05:55 PMA lot has happened in my life in the last year, but I've just learned that I'm being promoted over my boss, who's being demoted. We've had a lot of issues with a major project for the last six mos. and even though we made most of our deadlines, we missed some by a couple of days despite ridiculous amount of overtime, mostly on my part.The issues we had were out of our control, and two of our team have been fired due to their part in it, but neither I nor my immediate supervisor had any hand in hiring for the team.He's PISSED, and I don't know that anyone could have done better--maybe, but I don't know that I could have. I don't know if I feel ready to do his job...So now what? A part of me says this is just a lead in to firing him too, but I could be sensing it wrong.They’re spinning it as this is temporary to allow him time to come up to speed on his training and credentials that kept him from helping out when it got really tight and we had a lot of rework due to those who’ve been let go.Like Sam Beckett used to say in every episode of Quantum Leap, "Oboy..."
