Asthma confusion, please help?  23  Hello,I have a quick question that I would like to get off of my back.I had been diagnosed with asthma in 2004. I had an appointment with the asthma clinic last week, where she re-diagnosed me with childhood asthma. She stated that because I haven't had an asthma attack, there is no way that I need to continue using my inhaler.She has since removed my medication from the prescription.Now, other nurses' have claimed that my asthma was well controlled. If that is the reason why I haven't had an asthma attack.I am unsure whether you are supposed to have actually gone through an attack to be asthmatic. I personally think no, but I would be happier hearing your view on this instead.Sorry about how stupid this all may seem.I will appreciate any responses given.Thank you for reading...
