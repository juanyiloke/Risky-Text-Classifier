Looking For IdeasI am on a CTO in the UK and am forced to take medication for Paranoid Schizophrenia which is a wrong diagnosis. I've had a tribunal but had no luck. I don't want to take the medication (Risperdal) because it harms my body which makes it a poison by definition. Does any one have any suggestions.Are lots wrongly diagnosed. It's just that I have been badly targeted over the last seven years and five months which has led to this situation. I'm afraid this has led me to believe Thomas Szasz when he says that there is no such thing as mental illness. After all there is no scientific test for mental illness, it all comes down to an ill informed opinion. Maybe the people who post on boards like this are acting to keep the story going.Point is they think of us as pets. Schizophrenia is spa. A is 10 which is 2 which is B which is 8 which is E. So we're ******* to them.
