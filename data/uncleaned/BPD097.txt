In shockby kah80 » Thu May 21, 2015 1:40 pmThose of you who have read other posts by me know that I have a huge crush on a woman at work.Today the woman emailed me to tell me she is leaving in 6 weeks. It will be announced tomorrow. It was sweet of her to let me know before tomorrow. It's not like we're really friends or anything. But I'm so grateful she did- I'm not sure how I would have reacted when the announcement was made to the whole department.I told her I would miss her. I had to stop myself saying anything more.I feel like I'm in shock. I realise deep down this is a good thing. But I am addicted to her and the thought of her not being there is horrifying at the moment. I think I am feeling abandoned by her. I feel like I could burst into tears at any moment.Goodness knows how I'll be able to act disinterested on her last day.
