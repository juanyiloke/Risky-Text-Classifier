Hello there I'm currently pregnant with my second baby and looking for a moses basket, with stand, for preferably less than £100  Can anyone make any recommendations of ones they have tried and tested, please?Often I have found the product reviews in store are from first time mums who have not had their baby yet, who tend to concentrate more on the aesthetics of it, rather than how sturdy and safe it may be. Also, can I ask what others' opinions are of the padded lined baskets, please? They seem to be more sturdy but how safe are they if baby ends up with her face against the lining... is it breathable? I've previously read that cot bumpers aren't great for that very reason, so I'm concerned the padded lining on a may be similar?Thanks
