 Revision tips for a history undergraduate!by historystudent15I’m wondering if anyone can help with some revision tips. I have two exams in three weeks time. One is consisting of essays – 3 to be picked from 10 questions, across a possible 6-7 themes. And one is a primary source exam – they give you extracts from various sources, and you have to answer questions on them. I have focused my secondary reading on 5 key themes (again, from a possible 7). I figured this should be OK.I’ve typed notes for all of these, and was going to transfer the notes to A5 cards so I can take them around with me. I was just going to learn them inside out, maybe practice some exams. What other techniques might work? Should I read through all the primary sources, or just rely on my secondary reading? Any handy tips MUCH appreciated!
