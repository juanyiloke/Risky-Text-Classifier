Feeling hopeless I've had depression for more than half my life. I've been on and off medication the whole time and nothing seems to 'be the answer'. At the minute I can't be bothered to get up most days but force myself otherwise I'll lose my job and eventually my house. I'm working 50 hours a week then studying for a degree which I am becomming more and more disillusioned with as the marking isn't consistent and I'm just struggling with the content. I've been in my job for nearly 8 years and have managed (so far) to only be signed off once...I don't know where my life is going...I'm over weight, no energy, can't seem to concieve (we've been trying for a year now). Every single thing I do is either really hard to get and keep hold of (which saps my energy) or never works out.My job is a nightmare, I sit there most of the time and realise that I'm the only one doing any actual work while the others internet shop and read the news all day yet I'm the one who gets all the tasks to do and whilst my boss will say 'you know I appreciate you' I quite often feel like they don't. It always seems to be me who is expected to do everything because I've been there the longest but how will that help if no one else learns? I've thought about leaving but I can't get a job doing what I'm doing now for the same wage which I need to keep paying the bills.I'm trapped with no way out
