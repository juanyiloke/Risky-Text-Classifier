Trying and FailingThis is the first time I'm admitting this so forgive the long windedness--I've suffered from bulimia for years now. It's been so long i don't quite remember when it started exactly. Maybe I've had it for about 10-12 years or so.In the spring/summer/fall, I'm really good. Working out, eating healthy... and purging less often than in winterSometimes in the evening I abuse laxatives. But, I've noticed that my system can't go on it's own anymore. I'm hoping to train it to be better and be able to manage without the help of these laxatives. I'm scared what i may have done to my insides. And considering this is my biggest secret, I haven't been to a doc and I don't know if i'll be ready to.Any feedback, encouragement, thoughts, help, anything at all would be helpful. I need a buddy, i need a friend in this. I'm lonely in my suffering that I don't understand. Other than that my life is so happy. I'm recently married, i have a good fulfilling career... this behavior of mine started because of high pressure to lose weight from my parents and extended family. I've never been thin. About 10 years ago I was much heavier and have since lost weight but I am not heavier than my lowest weight and it's driving me crazy and preventing me from recovering.
