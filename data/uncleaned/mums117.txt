I know teeth don't always come in in textbook order, but this was a bit unexpected!DS is 17mo, and he has 6 teeth - 4 front at the top and 2 at the bottom. He's not had any new teeth since 13.5mo, and I was really wondering why such a long gap...He's been very grumpy this week and waking up quite a few times a night too, when he usually sleeps through. He was having tantrums today, and screaming before his nap. I thought he was very tired, but then decided to check his teeth again, and I ran my finger through all of his gums as opposed to just the front. And I found a corner of top molar poking through!ÊI was wondering if anyone had this? When did the remaining front teeth come through?
