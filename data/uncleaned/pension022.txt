Help needed with some ResearchHello all!My name is Stephanie, and I am a student with Sheffield Hallam University doing a Masters Degree in Developmental Psychology. As part of my studies I have to conduct a research project of my choice. The study I have chosen to conduct is into emotional regulation and harmful behaviours in both students and older people as in my research I feel that older people are not considered very much in this topic.I am looking for anyone over the age of 60 to participate. It involves filling out four questionnaires and should take around half an hour.ÊI have proper information sheets available to email to anyone who is interested and I am happy to answer any further questions you may have. Sheffield Hallam University have passed this study through their ethics panel and all information will be kept private and confidential.If this sounds like something that you may be happy to help me with, or if you want to find out more please email me (I believe you can do this via my profile? As I can't leave my email address apparently).Thankyou!Steph
