Steroid Inhalers and Thrush Although it is minimised by the inhaler manufactures and vested interests I developed long lasting thrush from possible use of Beconase inhaler.this thrush is proving difficult to clear using mild propriety thrush medications(lozenges-oral liquids)at this time.When the inhaler was prescribed no indication was given-apart from the intsruction leaflet-that this might result.If it had then I would not have used the steroid inhaler.Its difficult to get information about this-how long it lasts,how to clear it.Does anyone else have any experience of this phenomonen or know about immunosuppressents and their effects?
