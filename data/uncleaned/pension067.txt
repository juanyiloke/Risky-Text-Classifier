SPAM HMRC EMAILS - PLEASE BE AWARE!!!!!     I enclose a copy of two spam emails from HMRC which I confirmed with HMRC today - the first one is regarding a tax refund, firstly HMRC no longer email people due to the amount of fraud around at the moment, secondly the wording at the bottom of the letter where it states "a toll free customer service phone number" is not used.
