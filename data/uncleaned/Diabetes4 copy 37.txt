Kindle WhingeNot the end of the world, the main reason for me reading a Kindle version of any book is that I feel that it might save a few trees. It's not as good as having the book, IMHO, but I've never liked using screens of any sort and I worked in IT from 1973, when there weren't that many screens about. Anyway, you could never use postit notes in a program source code listing if it was on a screen. Fellow IT workers will probably know what I mean.The point is, having looked at the two books mentioned in lozzark's message, I was surprised at how close the price was for kindle and paperback. I'm happy to pay the author for his efforts, but is the cost of printing something that little? As I said at the beginning, not the end of the world, I hope the author is getting the lion share although a friend of mine who has had three books published, only gets £1 for the Kindle version. He's written "Ticket to Yesterday" (self published), "Bagels and Bacon", and "The reluctant Traveler". Fern Britton, a local to these here parts has even enjoyed reading his books, although I think only "The reluctant Traveler" is available on Kindle.
