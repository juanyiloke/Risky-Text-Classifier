ÊSo tiredEverything is just such an effort right now. I know all the theory about exercise, eating healthy, mindfulness etc. But I am just exhausted and fed up. It's even hard to focus my thoughts and eyes and write this.Last week I felt low / sad / tearful, now I just feel nothing but wanting to shut down.I have tried medication route before but it just made everything worse and then I felt let down by mental health team and stopped engaging with them.So I guess I have to just sit here in what feels like a dark cage and wait for the door to open.How do others get through these times?Soup
