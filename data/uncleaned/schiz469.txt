ÊBeing schizophrenicHello everyone I'm 25 I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia with depression) with a side of anxiety. I'm much better than past years after taking medication for sometime but here are some symptoms I was/am having. Hearing voices while trying to sleep. The most times I heard voices were at night or when I got tired one time eminem was talking to me lol I was so excited I told my cousin thats one of the things that happen when you hear voices is it's mostly someone you know or close to eminem just happens to be my favorite rapper so after this I thought I had some connection with eminem (feeling of grandiuer) which is another symptom thinking your famous or somebody important in the eyes of the public. I ended up getting a music note tatted on my neck because of this don't get me wrong I do like music and love tattoos but I got the tattoo because I thought I had some secret connection with a few artists I would think they're talking to me and only me threw their music so yeah I actually stop listening to music and watching tv deactivated all my social media accounts because I got tired of the tv and music talking to me so I would just lay in bed all day starting at the ceiling thinking my mom is tryna poison me so I would only drink faucet water. (Paranoia) I don't think people are trying to kill me anymore but I do still think people can read my mind sometimes so I try to avoid public places where there are a lot of people or I still think like a random stranger is tryna make fun of me or plotting against me in some way so I'm a house cat I don't even like playing games were u can hear other people talking because I think in some way they know everything about me and they're talking about me which makes no sense from thinking cameras are in my vents to my bf who was in the army was spying on me. I'm actually the best I've been in years from my diagnoses like I can actually get out the house instead of staying in for months on time. So my suggestion for anyone who has it or think they have it get checked out and start your medication. One question I have is anyone else having the mind reading symptom and what do u do to cope
