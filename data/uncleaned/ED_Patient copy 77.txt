I think i have an eating disorder, but I'm not entirely sure. Can someone help?So recentlty i've been entertaining the thought of accepting that i may have an eating disorder. Since i was about 14 I've been experiencing body image problems, but they never manifested into anything serious (or so i thought). I was probably about 16 (im 17 and a half now) when i began acting upon this potential eating disorder. I'm constantly tracking what i eat to the point where it's obsessive and i get annoyed at myself for my lack of ability to think about anything else. I count calories, frequently weigh myself, but the worst part is that it feels normal. I dont feel sick. Some days i eat more than i should, some days i eat nothing at all. But i never starve myself. If im not hungry, i wont eat. I've gone days eating absolutely nothing but with out feeling hungry.  Can someone please help me get to the bottom of whatever this is?Side note:I'm 5'5'', 121 lbs
