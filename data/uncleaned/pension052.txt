Does music help keep you young?According to a new study from Northwestern University lifelong musical experience has an impact on the aging process and that age-related delays in neural timing are not inevitable and can be avoided or offset with musical training. By measuring the automatic brain responses of younger and older musicians and non-musicians to speech sounds, researchers in Northwestern’s Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory discovered that older musicians had a distinct neural timing advantage.Previous studies from Kraus’ Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory found that musical training may also offset losses in memory and difficulties hearing speech in noise, two common complaints of older adults. The lab has been extensively studying the effects of musical experience on brain plasticity across the life span in normal and clinical populations, and in educational settings.[/font]http://www.parentgiving.com/elder-care/newsflash/how-music-really-does-keep-you-young/Do you find music can have an energizing/uplifting effect on you in general.
