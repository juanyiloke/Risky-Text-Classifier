Travelling with DiabetesHi, I’m 20 and been a type 1 diabetic for 19 years of my life. I have recently started a new project for university about how people with diabetes can sometimes be put off travelling because of their condition. I would be really interested to hear of peoples personal experiences of travelling with diabetes, how they have gotten over stressful times while they have been abroad or travelling abroad; and also the problems they have faced while travelling (for eg. how it can be difficult to keep your insulin in a cool area), things that just simply annoy you and cause unwanted anxiety etc. I’m here to listen to you moan so hopefully I can design something that will ease the stress of travelling to different countries   Please don’t be shy and play your experiences down (I’ve probably experienced a few in my time with diabetes too). Thank you!!
