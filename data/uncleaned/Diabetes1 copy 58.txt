My 12-year-old son wet the bed!I think. It's times like these I wish my ex-husband were still around. I don't know anything about being a 12-year-old boy! I was going through his hamper just now (doing the laundry) and found his bed sheet all the way at the bottom. It has a yellowish stain right in the middle, and smells of urine. Not sure how long it's been there. I want to ask my son about it, but I don't want to embarrass him. He's 12, I know what it could mean, if it's not what I think it is. I think I'd rather it be him "growing up" than urine, because I'm afraid if he's wetting the bed at his age, it could mean kidney problems. How does a mother talk to her pre-teen son about these things? I'm worried it might be his kidneys. I want to call his doctor, but don't know what to tell her, yet. Please help! Thanks.
