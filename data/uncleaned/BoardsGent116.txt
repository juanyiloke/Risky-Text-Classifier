Miss RepresentationHas anyone seen the movie?I sat down to watch it on Netflix last night but after 20 minutes if hearing about how women are portrayed wrong the media because of a 'male ideal' I turned it off.I thought it was anti male and it got my back up. I'm going to give it another shot tonight and give it a go because the website says:"we couldn’t move toward real cultural change without also exposing and challenging the damaging masculinity narrative that is fed to our boys and men."
