My weird depression Hi i just joined here, i was diagnosed with moderatly sever depression in june 2013 by my doctor, i only went to her because my partner of 20 years had noticed that something was wrong, i would snap at the most smallest of things i was constantly crying every day when i woke to go to work, i was working in a school as a cleaner, i became feeling more and more useless, i had that same job for 8 years, everything was ok until a new line manager and a new caretaker came along, it seemed everything i did was not good enough, i was working just a few hours of the evening but my work load had become almost impossible, i was never told that this was good but maybe i could improve on other areas, just the negatives, i just hated going there, it got to the point that i gave up, i never imagined that i could get some type of depression, my sleep pattern was horrendous and still to this day i sleep no more than 3 or 4 hours a day, i was told i needed therapy so i did go to bct which seemed to help, then they started to look back at my medical history, and i had also been assigned to a pyschiatrist when i was just 18 years old, the reason? i was in college i was late from lunch and drunk a half pint of lager?????????? i remember asking that man do you know me without looking at your records? i am 40 now and feel a little guilty he was just doing his job. They do not know why i have this depression but they claim it came from the death of my father when i was age 5, but i can hardly remember anything about my father i was too young. My partner has been so good and supported he has been my rock, i am now cutting down on my citalopram i was on 20mg a day now i take 10mg on tuesday thursday and saturday, last june i was diagnosed with diabetes type 2, because of my weight which is only my own fault my first blood test results were 73 i am now on 42, i just used common sense on my diet and lifestyle, i do still have days i wish i was not here but it is getting better, my word to others going through depression, please dont think the tablets and therapy are a quick fix, you have to be patient and take time, it will get easier but it will not happen overnight
