Tired, unmotivated, is this anxiety? Any advice acceptedA year or two ago I was an incredibly social almost to a fault. Recently, I can barely get myself off the couch to be motivated. I'm a fulltime student with a part time job that's just hours a day and walking is a big part of my job, but I never feel the energy to text, talk to, let alone go out with friends. I hear about clubs I'm interested in but I never can summon the energy to go. This unfortunate turn of events is making me lose friends, even ones I really like, drop out of my sorority and even not be able to bring myself to see my best friend. When I'm in class and I see the assignments ahead of me, I get the overwhelming urge to drop out of school because I can barely see myself accomplishing them. These are my most favorite subjects.Please help, any advice would be awesome. I eat well, exercise and drink coffee occasionally which barely helps. I'm always on-empty mentally and physically. I ignore my friends because I can't deal with the expectations of showing up. This isn't me. I wonder if medication might help
