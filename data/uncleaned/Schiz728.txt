ÊThese aren't candy!So you may have heard about the rule of thirds where a third of people supposedly get better from psychosis. I really haven't read about this actually happening to any real people and my pdoc has only been treating people for like 5 years although he is a schizophrenia specialist. Anyway he can't give me any concrete examples of people who have gone off the meds and don't get sick again within a year or so. He says that we just lose track of these people. I find that hard to believe. Really there is not one person who got miraculously better and would want to share that with the rest of us?Anyway my voices have been gone for around a year and a half now with the exception of a mini break around Christmas when I was changing jobs. But that resolved within a day basically. So yay me but now he is pressuring me to get off the meds. He actually said that these aren't candy. While I appreciate the concern. I already tried to go off the meds a year ago and I started snapping at everyone and had really high anxiety. After 3 weeks I went back to a higher dose to feel good again. I was afraid I was going to have another break, which as you know is hard to recover from and from what I've read you can actually lose more functionality.So I don't want to lose myself again...I'm so inclined to stay on the meds but he wants me off. I think I am going to try it even though its scary. Its just that there should be some examples of people getting better right? I mean I would be telling everyone. I won't be about to go off the meds until the end of June but would appreciate any advice about going off the meds permanently, especially if you've done this without experiencing voices or delusions. I'm on 7.5mg of abilify right now which is already low but had problems on 5 mg last year.
