Feeling Lost and worried.________________________________________Hi, perhaps some of you can offer me some insight. I just saw my polmonologist on Friday. Had been diagnosed with asthma after a long bout of illness. Bronchitis-Pneumonia. He is concerned( as am I) because the asthma meds: nebulizer(Abuterol ) and inhaler ( Dulera) do not seem to be helping me enough. I have been sick for 6 months with little relief. Doctor is sending me for a cardio stress test to see if the problem resides in my heart. Besides the fact that this scares me ; I don't understand how a illness can begin in my lungs (pneumonia) and end up in my heart. My symptoms now are mainly shortness of breath which seems to mostly be triggered by activity especially talking, interminent chest pain, cogestion and feeling of mucus in my throat constantly. I am nervous tired of feeling crappy and really need to get some answers. Thank you.
