I've had a horrible time the last month or so with my lungs and asthma. Unfortunately, it was necessary to take large doses of prednisone, 40mg a day for awhile but now down to 10 mg a day. I hadn't needed prednisone for a few months, so I had forgotten how awful the side effects are. Very little sleep unless I take a sleep aid, jittery feelings and irritability, weight gain and puffiness, and I want to eat the house down. I sure wish I never had to take this steroid again, but it is what it is. Does prednisone effect anyone else this way? I've been having some "rude awakenings" with leg cramps- Charlie horse cramps for a few weeks now. The calves in my legs are actually sore from having so many. I've been using my nebulizer a lot the last couple of months with albuterol. I read somewhere that thealbuterol can be a potential problem with cramps. Even my thumb and hand was cramping yesterday. I'm sure I'm well hydrated. I drink lots and lots of water, and I have been eating bananas to help with possible low potassium. But I noticed the cramps didn't start until I was using the nebulizer more frequently. Has anyone else ever experienced this kind of problem?
