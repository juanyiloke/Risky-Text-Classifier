Unsuspecting women post nude selfies in solidarity with Jennifer LawrenceOn twitter the evil perverts of the website known as 4chan have started a bogus twitter meme called #LeakForJLaw. Apparently they have fooled countless numbers of unsuspecting women who have posted their own nude selfies on twitter in "solidarity" with Jennifer Lawrence and other actresses who have had their phones hacked.A poster on the 4chan site is the suspected hacker who began boasting sometime ago about a cache of accumulated photos. When other posters started calling his bluff he leaked several photos and then finally released hundreds of photos in a what has been dubbed "The Fappening."The perverts have had a good week.The moral of the story is do NOT take naked selfies on your phone people!
