No name for my breast cancer¥	Iv been dx with bc but no one seems to have a name like iv seeN in here and other forums ! I'm confused and my husband says why do we need a name etc but feel like they not telling me something! I do know it's in my ndoes as this is how I knew if got it but don't know how many as iv opted for the chemo first to hopefully shrink first for better surgery. has anyone else just been told it's bc and no further info ? An I being a control freak ! I asked doc doin biopsies size etc and she seemed surprised I was asking!!!!!! wtf ???!! She told me was 18mm x 15mm with a nodule attached !
