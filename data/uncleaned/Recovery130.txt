Quitting SmokingSo I've recently given up the evil filter ( and yes i do mean cigarettes). The first few weeks were not easy by a long chalk. But i can safely say i now feel a lot less anxious about things.I have also realised that the only reason i smoked was down to boredom and it's been a case of keeping busy. Hence probably my return to DF for some guidance and also to keep busy.I know it's not easy and I am not going to get all ex-smoker on you lot....but i reckon it's worth giving up.
