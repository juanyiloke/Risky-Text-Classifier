living in a obession which nearly killed meim 16, i got diognosed with anorexia/bulima when i just turned 15, at first i restricted my food intake ever so slightly until it got the point of full blown starvation, my hair was falling out, numerous fainting spells, blurred vision, periods stopping for months, very high mood swings, and feeling dperessed 24/7 was pretty much of what life consisted of. I lost all contacts with freinds having fun which is what most 16 years olds do isnt it? But i didnt care the disease telling me i was fat was more important all i cared about was becomming thinner. 3 months down the line a vicious circle of throwing up everyday from 7 - 10 times a day began, using upto 20 laxative a day also became hell. I used to be a happy clever girl, confident and enjoyed life socalising but all of that seemed to have dispearred. i was nearly 9 stone beofore my eating disorder bombarded my mind with negative thoughts about myself, i dropped to 5 stone 11 with a feeding tube down my nose, one day it clicked i need to get out of hospital and i did i thought it would go away unfortunatly i still struggle however maintaining a low healthy weight. However because of this i cant enjoy food the ay i used to if you think about it food is one of the most important essentials in a persons life its pretty much controls what you do, without food your unable to do the things you enjoy most, most of all the disease takes over and controls everything to do with the food, sometimes i never realised what i did until afterwards i had thrown up its strange how something which sounds easy (but i promise really isnt) can ruin your life and education.
