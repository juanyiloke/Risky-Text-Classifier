asthma inhaler causing spasms ?  3  I don't know if it is a chest spasm but I have a breathing problem where it feels my chest muscle jumps and my breathing is then prolonged I admit I have that doom feeling when this happens cause I can't breathe so iv not had it all day although iv had the feeling of getting no enough air and as my throats full of phelm from a cold took my inhaler and it worked I coughed and my throat kind of cleared but now I keep getting this muscle jump feeling in my chest and it feels it locks up to the point I can't breath and do a little gasp could this be a side effect of asthma inhaler I use ventline xx
