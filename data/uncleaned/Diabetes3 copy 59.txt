White cells in sample twicewhen I went for my diabetic appointment a month ago they found white cells in my urine sample. They seemed surprised that I didn't have signs of a urine infection. I didn't think much of it. Last night I had to go to the out of hours doctor because I'd been feeling completely spaced out, light headed and weak for no reason. The GP couldn't find a cause but again there were white cells in my sample but no evidence of a urine infection. I was particularly surprised about the presence of white cells because this was an evening sample ie not an early morning concentrated sample. All thoughts appreciated please.
