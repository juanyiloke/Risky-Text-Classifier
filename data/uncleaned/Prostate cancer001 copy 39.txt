first results after op and choice HI all been to see surgeon on 20 of Jan who told test on what was removed showed  lymph nodes where clear but margin at base of prostrate showed some cancer just outside prostrate ,took blood for PSA and said it was debatable if all was removed . Saw RT consultant today 28 Jan who had PSA result as undetectable but went on to say it would 50/50 chance of returning and gave me three options, to have RT in about 3 months to wait and see if PSA rises and stay under the urologist care or to go on a trail where they treat you at different stages of PSA rise , has any body been on one of these trials? yours AndyPissed off Not been on for a while after op as had a low feeling as everybody else must do, probably a bit of self pity and to much time to reflect yet I should feel lucky that I have been given choices ,wounds have healed well but still got catheter in which has caused me pain discomfort and bleeding got appointment for 31 dec for removal but specialist nurse rattled the cage and got it brought forward to the 24 dec . So feeling pissed off as I have also put weight on with being inactive, sorry for going on as you all must feel the same at times Andy
