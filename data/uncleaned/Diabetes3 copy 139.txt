The Forum's future - your ideas/feelings needed!Over the course of this year we are hoping to make improvements to the forum and expand its influence. I think that, even if you have only been a member fr a short while, it will be clear what benefits the support of our peers can bring in helping people affected by diabetes, to learn about the condition and how to control it well. We need to bring this to the attention of as many people as we can, so I'm asking for your help in finding ways we can improve awareness of the forum, and also improve its usefulness to the members  Any and all thoughts would be very welcome   There are thousands of people out there who I know would benefit from using the forum, but they may not even be aware we exist! Whatever ideas you have, please post away and let me know, thank you
