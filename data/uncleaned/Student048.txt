I'm scared I'm making the wrong decision, did you feel this uncertain?by penski5Heya,I recently picked London college of communication as my firm choice. However when I went to the open day a couple of days ago I had a very scary realisation that I'll be living in London in a few months. I loved the course, it sounded amazing. The area was rough but where the halls are situated are nice. I'm just scared about living in London...it's always going to busy and I'm also scared because the course wasn't asking for high entry grades making me think it will be rubbish but at the same time it sounded amazing. I guess what I'm looking for is some reassurance..has anyone got some personal experience to share. Did you feel this uncertain before you went to uni?
