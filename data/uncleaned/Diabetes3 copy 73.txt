Sky newsI've been up for ages. I went to bed at 2.30am this morning, I wanted to finish my book. I was woken by a terrible pain in my back at 5.30am, lying down makes it feel worse. So I got up. I've been watching Sky News, they had a news report saying they could use Victoza as a weight control drug for non diabetics. It's success in weight loss is good apparently. Interesting story. Another report they showed earlier was a guy in the USA who was jailed 40 years ago for murder. Now DNA tests show that the hair found at the murder site were not his. So he's been jailed for a crime he did not commit. How awful for him, a whole lifetime gone. It's great that he's free but the world has changed so much since he was sent to prison. Poor man no amount of compensation can make up for the life he lost. Some interesting news stories but I'm hoping my back pain will go away soon then it's back to bed for me.
