anxiety, weakness and tremblingHelloi recently suffered a death in the family and had a couple panic attacks, since then my body or heath has not been the same. I first started getting vertigo, then my thigh was twitching for about a week, that stopped and my hands began feeling weak, that stopped and i started getting weakness in my thighs, also sometimes i get headaches all over my head, I had a full blood test which was clear, I keep reading about things like motor neuron disease and multiple sclerosis which has made me feel afraid and worse then ever. My doctor thinks all this is due to anxiety and has sent a referral for an mri. He thinks this is all due to my anxiety,Please help
