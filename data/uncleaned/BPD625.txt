I Have Borderline Personality DisorderBorderline Personality Disorder. People with borderline personality disorder are unstable in several areas, including interpersonal relationships, behavior, mood, and self-image. Abrupt and extreme mood changes, stormy interpersonal relationships, an unstable and fluctuating self-image, unpredictable and self-destructive actions characterize the person with borderline personality disorder. These individuals generally have great difficulty with their own sense of identity. They often experience the world in extremes, viewing others as either “all good” or “all bad.” A person with borderline personality may form an intense personal attachment with someone only to quickly dissolve it over a perceived slight. Fears of abandonment may lead to an excessive dependency on others. Self-multilation or recurrent suicidal gestures may be used to get attention or manipulate others. Impulsive actions, chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness, and bouts of intense inappropriate anger are other traits of this disorder, which is more common among females. Symptoms-- Borderline personality disorder;may suffer from extreme mood changes, swinging from being unrealistically happy to feeling extremely depressedmay choose inappropriate friendships from a fear of being alonesometimes cut or burn themselves on purposeare more likely to threaten to kill themselves than people who suffer from other personality disorders.This story was originally posted by majahi.
