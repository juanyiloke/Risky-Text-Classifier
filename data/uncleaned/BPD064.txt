Working w/ a Tby Sonseearae » Fri May 22, 2015 4:26 amHow do you do this? I want to cooperate. They pulled a court order on me (which I beat) for 72-hr involuntary hold and I just realized, I want nothing to do with them any longer. However, since they still have me as a 'danger to self', I save myself a lot of trouble if I just do their dance and get out of there on their terms. I pick my battles these days...getting old.But here's the thing... I have no idea how to not control what he thinks about the therapy I just had. I have no idea how not to manipulate him into thinking what I want him to think. I'll tell him he can't trust me, tell him how I'm going to manipulate him - and then do it! And get away with it. It's not even for fun any longer - it's just who I am.I don't trust them. I don't trust that they're smarter than I am and the only way I can trust my mental health to them is if they outsmart me. It hasn't happened yet. Anyway, how do you let go of who you are so that you can expose who you are?
