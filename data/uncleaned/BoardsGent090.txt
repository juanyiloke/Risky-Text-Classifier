Haircuts

Right, I'm sure others have been in this situation.

I have no idea what way to style my hair, it's basically thick, and goes curly ish if I let it Grote long. I normally get a 4 at the sides and scissors on top, but then I just leave it every day and it just looks frizzy and crap.Ê

My girlfriend suggested a buzz cut which might be a bad idea, but before I go to drastic measures I'd rather talk to a hair dresser to see if there are any styles that suit me.

Have any of you had similar experiences, and how did you get on? I wouldn't have a clue what barber/hairdresser to go to and then how to ask them.
