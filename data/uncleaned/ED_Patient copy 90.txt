mental health act and CTOI'm Anorexic and I have been detained under MHAct since 28.08.13.Im out of hospital but under CTO.My ED is getting worst but I have to lie to my CPN that I'm coping.Mentaly maybe I was but 2 weeks ago I stopped taking my meds and my depression is getting out of control. I'm seeing my CPN next week but I'm so scared to admit I'm not taking my meds.My question is can they send me back ip if I'm not taking meds?I don't want to tell them that I'm struggling with food and waterloading before weigh in.I just want to avoid ip but I know I can carry on like this.Dont know what to do....
