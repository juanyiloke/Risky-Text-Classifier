Please save me the advice if you are not a doctor. I am looking for others who have Schizophrenia and who also take adderall. I am diagnosed with Schizophrenia and take adderall 20mg 5x a week. Without it no school work would get done. My symptoms neither decrease nor increase on the medication, they are always the same and always there. Voices and conversations of people who I know their voice so it is impossible for my brain to recognize it is fake because of the authenticity of the voices. People can look at me or have known me for many years and do not know I suffer from Schizophrenia however I do withdraw because of it sometimes. I am looking for others examples not people want to point their finger and beliefs onto me. Thanks.
