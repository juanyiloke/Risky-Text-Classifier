Going out alone in DublinFeels a bit sad that I even have to ask advice on this. Basically, I've only got a couple of close friends and they are in long term relationships so are always busy at the weekends. I'd genuinely prefer to do anything than sit in every Friday/Saturday night so I've been debating heading out alone. Has anyone here done this before, and if so where would you recommend going? I like nightclubs so I was thinking of Coppers, basically somewhere I wouldn't get noticed on my own. Cheers for any suggestions.
