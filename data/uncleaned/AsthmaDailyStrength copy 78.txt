Hi all. I'm new here. I was just diagnosed with asthma in August, though doctor suspects I've had it for years. I've suffered from frequent bouts of bronchitis, 3-4 times a year, for the past several years. This past May I was hospitalized with pneumonia. I am on immunosuppressants for psoriatic arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease. Between the arthritis and asthma, my immune system is a mess. After the pneumonia, I was having more and more issues with coughing and wheezing. When I was still wheezing in August, I went back to my GP. He said my lungs sounded tight and that's when he mentioned possible asthma. I went for PFT's which were borderline. The technician gave me a neb treatment and my numbers improved significantly, so I was officially diagnosed. Unfortunately I got sick with bronchitis at the end of sept and ended up in the hospital for 11 days. Since then I've been on a slew of meds...albuterol (inhaler and nebulizer), Advair,Singulair, and Zyrtec. I also take Mucinex and prednisone as needed, and I have a flutter device as well. Over the past couple of weeks my whole family has been sick with chest colds. My cold seems to have passed, but it's left my lungs feeling awfully tight and I've been short of breath at times. I'm currently on 40 mg prednisone for 5 days and nebulizer every 4 hours. Feeling better overall but still not great. So that's my story. This disease certainly scares me. Prior to being diagnosed, I really didn't think much of it. I thought of it as a childhood disease that most kids outgrew. Now I know better.
