Doing Poorly, AgainI am ridiculously frustrated. I was doing so freakin' well for months. Now I'm back to my worried about everything self. I have this really awful fear of being fired. All. The Time. To the point that I legit want to quit my job so I don't have to worry. Do any of you have any tips? I am on Zoloft and was seeing a therapist, but she has moved and I haven't been able to find someone I like to replace her.Like what exactly gets people fired 100% sure, right now?Dealing with a spouse who also has anxiety..or something.I have GAD and I'm a hypocondriac. I do not deal well with stress, friction, confrontation, negativity.....you get the picture.My husband has social anxiety. He gets very anxious around people (especially people he knows) and always thinks they don't like him or think badly of him. He has no joy anymore and it's really affecting our family. There is no joy and happiness anymore. I want to make it better for my children, but it's putting me in a depressed state as well. Has anyone dealt with this?  I don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated.  TIA.
