Daily Mail article - sex and health issuesHi everyoneOur head of communications has been talking to a journalist from the Good Health section of the Daily Mail regarding an article they are planning, looking at the issue of sex and how it affects people being treated for various conditions, including cancer.We're wondering if any lady members of this forum would be comfortable talking to a journalist about how bowel cancer has (or hasn’t) affected their sexual relations.If anyone is happy to speak to the journalist about their experiences, please drop an email to Stuart.barber@beatingbowelcancer.orgbest wishesNancyTravel Insurance...partnership with UniqueHi everyoneA survey of bowel cancer patients conducted last year revealed taht the majority of people, 85%, face difficulties when purchasing insurance, particularly travel insurance, due to their condition.We have partnered with Unique to offer travel, home and motor insurance for bowel cancer patients and their families.For each policy sold, Unique make a donation to Beating Bowel Cancer at no extra cost to you.To find out more, please visit: www.beatingbowelcancer.org/unique-insurancebest wishesNancyKings College Survey - 65+Hi everyoneKings College is planning to survey bowel cancer patients in certain age groups to see if those patients have differing attitudes to the decisions they make about their treatment and to establish what factors might influence those decisions.In readiness for this, Kings have asked if we can connect them with bowel cancer patients (either in treatment or those in remission) who are or were, over the age of 65 when they were diagnosed and for those patients to help review the questions and patient literature before it is used in a real-life scenario.This is a project that can be done via post or online and if anyone is interested please get in touch with Nicola Keeble at the charity. 020 8973 0013 or email Nicola.keeble@beatingbowelcancer.orgbest wishesNancy
