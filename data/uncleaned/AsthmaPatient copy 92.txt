1 year old with chronic chest infections/asthma - advice neededPosted 30 days agoMy daughter is 15 months and has had 5 acute chest infections this past year, each lasting 2 to 3 weeks. Docs think it is asthma. Until last month we lived  in India where she was nebulised with salbutamol and unfortunately had oral steroids for 3 days (for every episode). We are now back in the uk and she has been given an inhaler with ventolinnand steroids again (3 days). A couple of questions:- is this common? Are steroids commonly used for kids like her? - is there a cumulative effect of short term steroid use? Ie 5 courses of 3 days in a year?- how should I manage this going forwards? Are inhalers the best option? Are there any effective alternative medicines for asthma in babies? - is dairy a no-no? Should I strip it out of her diet?thanks so much for your help, iona
