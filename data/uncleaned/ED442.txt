ÊWhat do I do??I recovered (physically) from binge/purge anorexia about 4 years ago. But my thoughts about food have still never really been...what they should be.This is my second semester at college majoring in Biochemistry and taking 19 credit hours while trying to balance a part time job. I am constantly busy and don't have time for food. To make things worse, I'm on some new meds that kill my appetite.Since recovery, my weight has been seemingly stuck at one spot. But lately, well...Freshman 15? Yeah, in a negative direction.I keep trying to remind myself about all the bad things that accompanied being that unhealthy...gross textured hair, constant hair loss, always feeling dizzy and weak, different skin texture, bad breath...the list goes on.But still I wonder, as the scale continues going down...how much is too much? I'm not actually relapsing, right? I'm still in the healthy range.But....would it really be so bad?......
