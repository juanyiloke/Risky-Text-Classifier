Help with freestyle libre againHi sorry I cannot find the old thread that I need right now. Basically free style libre sensor will not stay on. The first one fell off with 8 days left. They gave me a new one. The exact same thing has happened! I have absolutely no idea why. Anyway somebody mentioned. Clear tape that I could put over it. It had a special name.......I think it was everydayups and downs who stated it. I am going to have to order some as this can't keep happening. Maybe my arms are just weird!
