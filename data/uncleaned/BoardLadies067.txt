TLL Pet Thread: Lookit Dem Cute Little Paws!I figured we could do with a thread for showing off our pets!I don't have any pets, but I did spend a few hours last night restoring a picture of my mother and our childhood dog. My plan is to get it printed off for Christmas and give it to my father (along with another photo I took myself of Cork City for my mother.) Now I also know I'll have a proper copy of it forever. It's a really special photo for me.Climber was the most relaxed dog I've ever known. He'd walk around the house, casually and without a bother on him. He knew he was part of the family and would happily sit down and watch telly with us, resting his head on my fluffy slippers. I miss him loads.
