PTSD is a REAl thing and everybody must find their own way to deal with it. I believe it needs more attention in the world. However. that being said, although many of us have things from our childhood, do not let that define your entire life. I think more should be done for our soldiers who have PTSD as they are reliving everything. A pet often helps. Somebody to tell all your secrets to that will listen for years to the same story and never judge. If you were a victom of crime, remember that there is nothing on your forehead telling the world that you have been a victom of crime. Seek inner strength and remember to breath. Slow strong breaths:-) You may not get over it but you can get through it. Depending on your cause, many a therapist may help you. Talk about it. If to an animal so be it.But do not dwell on it. That is counter productive to you and your health. You need the stress to go away. Laugh, dance, joke, whatever you want. Remember things you used to like and do them again or find somehting new to keep your time with. Make new friends. Good quality frineds. Good Luck:-) Warest Wishes, Temperwolf
