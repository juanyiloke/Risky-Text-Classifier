Blogging / WordpressHi Ladies!I have tried so many times to start a blog and gave up, thinking it was pointless, what the hell will I write about it.Well now instead of completely focusing on 'what people want to read' which IMHO was the reason I gave up so many times, I am now focusing solely on what I want to write about, and now I have endless categories!I'm not a fashion/beauty blogger by the way, even though I have a section for it to review products, talk about celeb fashion, my wants and do some OOTD. I also have big sections on food, parenting, health, life and where I live.If anyone has any tips they would like to share??I'm on wordpress, love it! Part of the reason I am committing to this blog is because I am so happy with the style and layout.. it makes the thoughts flow so much more easily!I won't tell you the name yet as I want to do a few more tweaks  but please bloggers share me the name of your blogs.. can't wait to join the community!
