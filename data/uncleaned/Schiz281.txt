Do you do anything for the people who have helped you? I really like doing any small or large thing to help my family now. They have helped me during my entire illness, nearly 35 years so I feel good that I can return the favors. I have house sat for them many times. I always tell them they don't have to pay me but they got good jobs and will ALWAYS give me money. I have gone to their house while they are away on business and vacations to water their plants and feed their animals. Every few months I take in my older sisters dog while she travels. I also give them rides if their car is in the shop. When my sister had foot surgery I drove all over town running her errands for her while she recovered. I have done yard work too, and helped them move several times. I even drove the moving van across town. And when my sister started her own business she hired me to load furniture in a U-Haul truck and I drove it down south across four towns to her storage space. I rented the truck, I loaded it up, and unloaded it. One thing I do for free is drive them to the airport but they haven't asked me for that in awhile. Anyway, what kind of stuff do you do for your families?
