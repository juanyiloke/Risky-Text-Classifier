Medication for bulimia?Hi,I'm ultra struggling with binge eating and purging (self induced vomiting) at the moment. It's become really out of control in that im purging every night multiple times.... and its extremely upsetting. I've been referred to the ED service locally and i *think* im on the waiting list for some form of treatment/support. The psychologist assessing me said he would try and get me to see their psychiatrist. I thought that fluoxetine was meant to be good for it and the only one licensed to treat it, but he was of the opinion that sertraline is the best.I'm under the HTT at the moment and they know how out of control and distressed i am feeling with all of this, and how its impacting my mood.So I was just wondering if anyone out there has had anything prescribed which has helped with bulimia?ÊI know meds alone won't solve it, im in therapy but still struggling.Thanks for reading x
