Ever had an off-day at work?2013-02-25, 09:03 PMI had one today.ÊI feel stupid. I feel like complete, utter idiot. And I know I'm not. Didn't get much sleep last night. Had a rough weekend prior to that and I'm just trying to stay awake on my feet and get through the day and not mess anything up but I did quite a few times today. I'm glad I pulled it together (with whatever adrenaline is left in my body) the last hour just to help out the staff but I feel so stupid and the entire staff was wondering what happened to me today. I can hear them whisper about me. I'm always good at what I do but today, I was just off. I needed rest. A whole weekend of rest where I do nothing and think of nothing.Rant over. I spent the whole drive from work to my place being positive when all I wanted was a boyfriend to hug me and assure me that tomorrow will be better.
