Help from pensioners neededPlease excuse me if this is the wrong place to post, I am hoping it is not breaking any forum rules.ÊMy name is Orli, I am not a pensioner, but I have registered on this Forum as I am looking for pensioners.I am working on a book, it is going to be a collection of advice/wisdom from people over 65.ÊI feel that the 65+ generation has a wider perspective about life, especially as they experienced a very different life to the one we are currently living. The choices they had to make were different, the options open to them were different etc... I think that we can learn a lot from looking through their perspective.I was wondering if anyone here would like to share their thoughts?ÊI have created a page with a very short survey (5 questions). Even if you only answer one question that would be great.Ê If you could spare a minute, please message me and I shall email you with the questions (it is a link to an anonymous survey).ÊThank you for taking the timeKindest RegardsOrli
