COLDSHas anyone had a cold recently, and found it to be pretty darn awful? I started with one on the Saturday of last week, and on Monday and Tuesday was literally laying down all day, out of it. Had the sorest throat I think I've ever had. Good job I was on holiday from work because I simply couldn't have gone in, and that is not like me. I normally work through colds. I know it wasn't flu because I've had that in the past, and it wasn't the same. I didn't have the high temperature or awful headache, but as colds go I wouldn't want it again that's for sure. I still don't feel well, and am coughing and can't breathe through my nose. No sense of taste at all. I know so many people who have had this. Is it a worse virus than normal, or is it because I'm getting older?
