on call policy / law________________________________________just a quick one as i cant find anything on citizens information etc.if a person is required to be on call as part of their job (e.g. 4pm to 8am) is there an allowance for annual leave accounted in there?situation is that person is off on mondays but job keep scheduling sunday on call work for them (8am sunday to 8am monday)job are saying that because the "day off" starts at monday 8am then they are allowed to schedule them on callany ideas on the rights or wrongs of this? it seems incorrect to me but cant find anything to support that
