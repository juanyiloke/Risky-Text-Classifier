Extreme HungerHello,I have been experiencing extreme hunger. I am emotionally struggling with if this is a normal aspect of recovery. I find I am always hungry, especially late at night. I tend to wake up feeling guilty and wondering if this is healthy? (I am also always hungry during the day). I have been told this is because my body was so depleted that my metabolism is starting up and repairing.I am also wondering how others have battled the ed thoughts/feelings of guilt? For example, soothing techniques for late at night. And whether people have found intuitive eating helpful. I found I got caught up in "rules" when I tried to meal plan.Thanks
