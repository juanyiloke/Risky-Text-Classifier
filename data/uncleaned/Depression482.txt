Chronic Physical Pain + Depression, Anyone Else?Ê  neurotic_lady89 ,Ê24 Apr 2015ÊCurrently I'm dealing with chronic, intense, joint pain alongside depression and anxiety. I feel that this pain, and worrying about my health, only make my anxiety/depression worse. I know depression can cause aches and pains, or intensify existing ones, and that being in pain can cause depression - it's vicious no matter what!ÊIs anyone else going through this? It's very hard to be optimistic when both your body and mind seem to be relentlessly fighting you.Ê- Christina
