Long time suffererHello I'm not sure where to begin, but I'm a 28 year old mother of two for starters and I been suffering from bulima since I was 16 :,( .I was doing so well at the age of 24 I turned my life around and started a well healthy diet and excersise regularly and I felt better!!!! I would relapse I would say twice or less a year since I changed my diet. What happens is I stress eat and I binge and then make myself throw up. Although it was worse when I was a teenager I would do it twice a day everyday and now I would say 3 times a month or less but I do get the urge but I tell myself it's not worth it. But I'm sooo tired of this I wish I didn't suffer from this I don't know who to confide in I'm so ashame and I feel so guilty I'm a mom!!!! My daughters need me I wish I can get over this and on top of that I suffer from anxiety:,( I'm so scared and worried I just want to be better. Is there anyone that can encourage me please :,( and give me hope. I'm tired of worrying about my weight and how I look and comparing myself to other women. I don't feel good enough . I just wanna accept myself and to stop letting this disorder control me.
