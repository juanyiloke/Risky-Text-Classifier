Really strangeComing back from long weekend away did my usual jab and packed insulin into case instead of hand luggage so ate roll and banana for lunch then got the nibblies (boredom) so had 3 jaffa cakes used spare pricker etc and was 15 so got home after 6hrs travel pricked again and was only 5.6 with no insulin and no excercise plus 2 biscuits when i got indoors as so hungry so this morning 24 hours after last jab was 5.2 lowest AM bg ever and was only sat on a train .Now wondering how this happens do i really need all the jabbing etc ??????
