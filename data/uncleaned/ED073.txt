Just letting go of the eating disorderHi,I'm new on here so not sure how this works but I guess i'm just looking for some advice/support?I'm suffering at the moment, having gone through a small relapse, I have realised that I've gone back to a lot of old habits and it just feels like i'm stuck with them, as if i'll never get rid of them.I want to recover fully so so much, and my mind is in a much better place than when in my first recovery, however this stuck feeling is getting me down. I feel like I have been given all of the 'recovery tools' - as in i know what I need to do, I just find it so difficult to let go of this illness, and I don't know why! I don't want to be ill, I have a lot to look forward to without it but am struggling to let go of this place I'm in and I don't know why :(Any advice?!
