Embarrassment/Guilt causing panic attacks....Okay, does anyone else get panic attacks/obsessive when they do something embarrassing? Let me tell you why... on Saturday I went to a party (I havent been out for about 4 years, so I decided I would try to be more social) I got really nervous and drank.. quite a lot. There is about an hour or 2 of the night that I don't remember, but I wasnt sick or anything like that.. i think i just zoned out, but anyway i got a message from one of the people at the party, telling me i was 'a mess' and throughout the rest of the day I had multiple panic attacks and i havent been able to stop thinking about it, but now ive calmed down a bit im starting think he was just being a judgemental jerk, because i dont think i did anything except space out (someone wrote on fb that i was spaced out on a sofa) which may have made it difficult to get me home... but thats all... thats not that bad, is it?Now I feel like I can never show my face to that group of people again, I feel so embarressed and the panic sensations start again when i think about it.Has anyone else ever had something like this happen?
