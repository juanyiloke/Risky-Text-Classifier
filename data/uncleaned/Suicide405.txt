HelpMiki CaballeroHi, I am Miki Caballero from the Philippines. I’ve been living with BiPolar 2 disorder for 5 years but even before I was diagnosed, I have attempted to commit suicide. My life is very hard. I was a battered child since I was in Grade 2 or 3 by my father who was always intoxicated. Back then, I felt that my mother didn’t really love me because every time my father beat me, she would just talk to me and say, please understand, he’s older than you, let it pass. For a long time, although I was given proper education and gave me some lessons etc. I felt that they didn’t really love me. So, I gave my attention to friends whom I found out wasn’t really true friends but was just using me. So here I am now, alone, after a fight with my younger sister and father, thinking of suicide. I feel so alone with no one helping me. I’m so hopeless like I have nowhere else to go. I have no friends, no one to help me.
