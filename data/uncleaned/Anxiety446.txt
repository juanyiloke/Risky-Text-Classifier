This is it!I know I've come on here and posted before stating that I was cognitively impaired and losing my ability to think straight, but this time is so different. I literally am losing it! I feel so confused and unable to think straight. Before my mind was racing with all of these thoughts of how impaired I felt,Ê and now it's like my mind is totally blank! I look at posts on here and other sites and it takes me numerous times to read them, and I still don't understand what I've just read. I try to come up with how I feel and my mind is blank! Just a week ago I could easily explain how I was feeling. Now there are no thoughts, no words..just a blank space.I don't know if this is just my anxiety increased or if it's due to side effects from stopping prozac a week ago. I stopped per my doctor's advice after only bring on it for 2 weeks due to an extreme increase of anxiety.Has anyone else experienced this feeling of not being able to think at all? It like my mind has turned off. I'm really scared.
