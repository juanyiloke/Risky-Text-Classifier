i spent 3 months in a psych hospital-hi, i spent a few months in a psych hospital (and a general hospital) for my anorexia, depression, anxiety, self harm, emetophobia and frequent suicide attempts. i feel like im slipping back to my old ways and im actually starting to MISS hospital?!? i hated so much when i was in there, but my social situations in the ''normal'' world are even worse.i still see a number of doctors etc weekly, as im 16 and under the mental health act.its just i dont know.. i feel so fat now, i would rather have all the other problems back again- including being in a wheelchair, tube fed, daily; blood pressure/heart rate/ texture checks.is it normal to miss this? im so lonley and all the suicide thoughts are getting strong again, i just wanted people opinions on my situation? like normal people, not doctors..
