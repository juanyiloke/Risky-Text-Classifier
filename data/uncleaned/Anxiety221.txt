Depersonalization ?Early the past winter i experienced severe anxiety accompanied with panic attacks,hyperventilation, numb hands, shaking etc. After some time i managed to control it and i haven't experienced a severe panic attack for 2-3 months now. Now when i feel that i am about to have one i have a set of rules that help me get over it in less than five minutes. Even though i have no more panic attacks i've experienced a weird feeling of Depersonalization. For instance i feel that my walking is happening on its own and i feel a bit detached when i walk alone. Some times i ask myself if what i am seeing is happening right now or if it is like a dream ( i have no hallucinations or voices ). This particular feeling usually happens when i haven't slept much. Sometimes i forget about it and i don't feel it at all. But still when i do have it i cant enjoy what i'm doing and i feel distanced. How can i make this feeling go away? Is it easy like the panic attacks where you follow some steps and you are fine in a while? Please help
