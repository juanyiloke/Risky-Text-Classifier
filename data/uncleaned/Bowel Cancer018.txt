Potions, Lotions, hair and other skin remidiesNot sure if a thread already exists of this, but I thought if may be worth having a thread where we could note down good creams or other products for skin or hair which we found really helped. We could put it on here, then other could come by it easily. This came to me as my onc was disguising that I may have to have Irinotecan to help with further shrinkage on my liver. He said my hair may fall out so was trying to find stuff out about wig stuff. But like I say it may already be around I am just being blind. I will put a few down that others have suggested to me, or I have found good.1.Hair dye, I found amazing recommended by lovely people on here Daniel Field, Gave me great cover and no horrible smell. I will continue to use after chemo as so impressed!2. Cream uderly smooth3. Jennifer Young. I found Uderly smooth has not helped with my feet cracking. But Jennifer young cream seems to do the job. Is very oily before it settles into pours, so be careful for floor slippage.www.jenniferyoung.co.uk/4. I am currently suffering from really bad acne, so I am trying loads of Elemis stuff (ridiculously expensive) to see if that makes a difference. It seems to be (will bankrupt me though), but this maybe as I got an extra week of to enjoy Christmas so it maybe a coincidence.add as you please Jem
