stopping hormone treatment¥	The first six months was not too bad, but the last three have been a bit of a nightmare.¥	I didn't start my treatment until I finished my radiation treatment was finished in an effort to keep everything clear on what treatment was causing what side effects. I'm glad I did.¥	I know exactly what side effects are caused by my hormone treatment, and I'm not doing it any more¥	The surgeon who gave me my first year check up advised I see my GP about my symptoms.¥	My GP said we can only deal with one symptom at a time. Then after one appointment sent me a letter saying it was not appropriate for him to treat me and I should see my oncologist and he had made me an appointment with a Gynaecologist as well. His complete dis-interest in helping me out was obvious.¥	the gynaecologist saw me and recommended one treatment, my oncologist wrote to my GP and recommended a different treatment. My breast nurse suggested a possible third but only after I saw the oncologist. then the GP wrote to me with a copy of the oncology letter saying it's up to me. And that was only one symptom.¥	Went to see my lovely oncologist on Friday, I am to stop treatment for three months then look at it again, I have decided I'm not going to continue. This was actually suggested by the oncologist, not my own idea. We had a laugh about what a small insignificant cancer I had compared to most. Nothing to worry about really.¥	The benefit of the treatment is 0.7% according to predict and the daily pain in my hands, and possible damage to my bones is just not worth it.¥	Now I have written this down I feel fine with my decision, Cancer will no longer be a daily feature  in my life and that is something I would have never believed a year ago.¥	To all of you in the fight, stay strong,¥	Keekers
