Super sensitive psa test    I just wanted to ask everyone that comes to this community whether they know if you can get the super sensitive PSA test done locally in Leicestershire or not?Presently my post da vinci surgery July 2012 at Addenbrooke was totally successful.However I was told my latest PSA had risen slightly and I need to go back in 3 months rather than 6 months.This necessitates a 2 hour drive or train journey/bus to the the hospital for a simple blood test.I don't mind it too much but I think in 2015 we ought to have a bit more flexibility about how PSA tests can be done post surgery.All three Cities in the East Midlands, Leicester, Nottingham and Derby all seem to now have the state of the art technology to provide men affected with prostate cancer the less invasive treatment. Has anyone out there an answer to this question?ThanksPeter
