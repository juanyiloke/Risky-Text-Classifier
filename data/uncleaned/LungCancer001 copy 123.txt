30yr old not feeling "sick" w/ 3.5X3.6cm lung mass=Cancer?Does a lung mass mean cancer?I was scheduled to have my 3rd laporascopic surgery to examine and laser off endometriosis. At my pre-op visit my doctor was concerned because I was suffering from some asthma symptoms (which I have had all my life). I recently visited my Sister who smokes. I tried to limit my exposure to the smoke but I still had coughing, shortness of breath, coughing up yellow/green sputum and chest tightness. To be safe she ordered a chest xray. I did not realize until Monday that my Doctor had been trying to get in touch with me to let me know that I was not cleared for surgery and that my chest xray was abnormal. They believed they found a lung abscess. I was immediately called in for a 2nd xray where a 3.5 X 3.5cm pulmonary opacity at the medial aspect of the right middle lobe was found. No air fluid levels.No plueral effisions. Could be a fat pad, infiltrate, hernia or mass. The Dr. called it a mass. Scheduled a CT Scan but I won't know anything for two weeks. I'm 30 yr old female with asthma history, Mother died from Leukemia. My wbc came back at 12.1 which is a little high I guess. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV values came back as abnormal low. WBC abnormal high.I have a history of abnormal cell/pre cancerous cells found in esophagus but last endoscopy came back normal. Other than a cough, minor chest congestion and hoarse voice I feel okay. Doctor added Community-acquired Pneumonia to my chart. Could this mean cancer? Shouldn't I show more signs of being ill? I was about 4mos premature so I am used to always having something wrong with me. Frequent colds, sinus infections, upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, allergies, etc. As a young child I stayed with my Mother in the hospital and remember how she suffered. I'm not ready for this. Any answers/personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. I am scared.
