Preparing for the In-Laws...Ok , I've noticed somthing recently. Since one of my siblings got hitched, every time I go down to my parents home I get roped into a serious amount of preparation for the visit of my siblings and their OHs.As its been a while since I brought a man home, I have never realized the amount of prep that goes into having the new in-laws over!The fancy china is out, a menu has been constructed, even the box of USA Assortment that was saved for a special occasion might be opened. I spent a good deal of yesterday scrubbing and tidying and I'm worn out.Just wondering, do all parents/you yourselves usually fuss this much when you bring a OH home?
