ÊCalories are making me feel sick? And scared.Over the past few years I've had problems where I have lost my appetite but I eventually got it back within a few weeks. Lately, for whatever reason, any time I eat something that I know is high in calorie or will put me just the finest bit over my calorie "limit" it makes me sick to my stomach that can take hours to pass. I looked at a box of candy today and thought that the calories for the serving was way to many calories I should consume for an item.I've never thought like that before. I'm truly starting to think that calories are the enemy. A part of me fears it completely, but there's this other part that just embraces it and the feeling of control that comes with it. Actually, I'm wondering if part of the issue is some guilt that I feel about not having the control to stay under my stupid calorie limit and if that is also what's making me nauseous.Also half the time when I eat I'm not even hungry I just want to eat and it frustrates me so much.The weird thing is that I know I'm already underweight and over all "skinny" but then there's the few areas that I wish where tinier (stomach and thighs).I think I've always been a little weight conscious. I remember being younger (1st or 2nd grade) and being so proud that I could squeeze my stomach past this gap between this desk and chair and began measuring myself frequently like that. I noticed one day that I couldn't fit anymore and it devastated my little mind. Being young at the time I didn't realize the connection between calories, or the foods you eat in general, to weight gain. Also I was still one of the tinier kids and I think that saved me from something drastic happening when I was younger but I don't know...ÊWell this kind of turned into a mini rant without a question but ill take anything I can get so please help...
