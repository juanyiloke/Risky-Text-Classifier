Bizarre Sleepby TheNonDenominator » Wed Feb 18, 2015 7:47 pmSo during the night, things turn upside down typically. I try and do everything right during the day, but somehow voices keep slipping through my head and it takes hours to fall asleep.I live in an apartment and the neighbor is right next to me; I can hear them talking, having sex, etc.This creates a very weird tension for me, it's like when I'm thinking, I can hear my thoughts echo -- literally; I was trying to fall asleep, and I swear I heard them acting as if they could hear me (saying 'see, I told you', 'he says that he's dead but alive', 'w-hole', etc.), but to my empirical senses my mouth was shut and I was simply thinking . . . this is the time it seems like negativity can't be avoided, paranoia next level.So I try and form perfect sentences in my head (out of anxiety) and feel like I am in a trance because there is some kind of telepathic node in my brain. A beeping noise occurs *only* at night and terrifies me when I'm just lying in bed awake -- not to mention all sorts of humming, like the static or buzz of a TV, flatlining of a heart monitor, oscillating electromagnetic force weaving through my flesh and thoughts, -.I want help but don't seem to be able to get it immediately (plans to move).
