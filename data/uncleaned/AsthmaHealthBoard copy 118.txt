Here's what we do for asthma________________________________________I posted about this a number of years ago, but we have recently learned how it works and how to make it better so I am posting again.For years my husband has had asthma and we accidentally learned how to overcome the symptoms. All he has to do is take niacinamide 500 mg of niacinamide and 1 gm of vitamin C with each meal and now we know that you also need extra magnesium, so 400-800 mg of magnesium and about 50 mg of P5P (activated B6) a day should do it for most people. If you have a large exposure to allergens you might need up to twice as much of the niacinamide and magnesium. The reason this works is because the DAO enzyme that gets rid of histamine needs B6 and vitamin C to work, and the next enzyme that gets rid of the product of DAO needs niacin and magnesium or else there will be a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body and this will cause a negative feedback loop inhibiting DAO and stopping the breakdown of histamine. So that's it. You have to support the metabolic pathway that gets rid of histamine to get rid of your asthma.
