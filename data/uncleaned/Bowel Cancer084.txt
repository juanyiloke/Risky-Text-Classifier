First PostI am a 67 year old male. In July 2011 I went to my doctors with haemorrhoids who referred me to my local hospital. I had an appointment for a sigmoidoscopy early December but they would not carry it out as they said would not be able to stand the pain. Had another appointment for February 2012 for it to be done under anaesthetic but then cancelled as I was then anaemic with so much bleeding. Eventually had the investigation in May 2012 to then be told after that I had rectal cancer then had CT scan and told it had gone to my lungs and liver.The consultant told me at the end of May 2012 I had less than a year to live with the state of my lungs and transferred me to the oncology department.There I was told that the average life span would be 2 years which was a bit better. I went onto chemo Folfox with avastin but felt unwell just before 2nd cycle went into assessment had CT scan which found clot on the lung so they stopped the avastin and had to have blood thinning injection everyday . Also found I had gallstones. They could not get drugs to alleviate the pain so I had saddle block injection which has taken pain away but loss of control of bladder and bowels so cured one problem and get two more. Started Folfiri chemo yesterday so its just wait and see.
