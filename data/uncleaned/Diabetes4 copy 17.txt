HbA1c Oops!Went to have my feet tested and the lovely nurse let me have a peek at my results (which were supposed to take a full week but took 3 days).  HbA1c gone up to 50.  Cholesterol 5.4 again so next week I am going to be fully prepared for suggestions I increase my dosage and take a statin. Won't do either.  All other tests fine.  Hope I don't have the whole 'I'm disappointed with this' act and certainly hope that she doesn't want to give me a load of good advice.  What I'm actually going to do when I go back to Spain is  to go back on Metformin without the extended bit and go back to basics taking my sugars pre and post meals etc etc.  If I find that my numbers are still high then I will up to 1500mg.  If not I'll just leave well alone.  (Getting as many strips as I can on Ebay at the moment).  I will admit to having not been so good in the past few months.  As Patti said I've been pretty naffed off and stressed.  If she (nursie) harps on about my cholesterol (didn't manage to get the breakdown but think my HDL was 3.2) then she can.  I won't be even considering a statin.  Anyway, put up 6 lbs so my naughties (like chips, lager and other unmentionables must go).  Onwards and upwards and I am going to climb back up on the wagon tout de suite!
