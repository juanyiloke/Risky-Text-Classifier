Has anyone ever used online dating sites? I need your assistanceGood morning everyone,I am a student journalist currently writing a feature on online dating for the over-60s.I was wondering if anyone out there of that age group, or slightly younger, has had experiences with online dating that they would be willing to share with me? Either over the phone or by email would be fine, whichever is more suitable for yourselves.I look forward to hearing from you. If I've posted this in the wrong place, my apologies.ÊMany thanks,BK
