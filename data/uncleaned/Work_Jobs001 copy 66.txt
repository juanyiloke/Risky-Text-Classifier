Not given a copy of my contract________________________________________I started a new job as an instructor on the 2 February last. I am based away from the head office so I have only been there once or twice since I started. I received a copy of my contract on my first visit there. I took it away, read it and brought it back signed on the second visit.I was not given my own copy which I thought was a bit strange so while I had the one I was given I scanned it in to my home computer. However obviously this was not signed by the employer, only by me.I thought maybe they will give me my copy sometime soon. I haven't actually started the job properly yet as the company haven't got the numbers to fill up the places for the course I am instructing.Since the 2 Feb I have been training. I have been assured by my fellow employees that the places will be filled as the company have put a lot of work into preparing it.I am not so sure though as my "proper" start date has been pushed out to a week later than what is on my contract. I emailed the HR person two days a ago asking for a copy of my contract but he did not reply. I'm a bit worried as the cynic in me is thinking that they didn't give me a copy of my contract in case they don't get the numbers to fill the course and can just tell me to bugger off. In hindsight it was stupid of me to not demand a copy for myself when I was given just a single one. I am a bit passive and had been out of work for a good bit before that so I didn't want to make waves as I was just so happy to be back in a job. Anyway it just seemed like such an obvious thing that I assumed they are going to give it to me later. Now it seems that they have no intention of doing that.If I do actually start the job then I will insist that I will not continue until I am given my own copy (signed by the employer of course).The copy I scanned has no legal standing of course. Has anyone else here had this experience?
