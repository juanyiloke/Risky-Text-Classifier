What is your PTSD story?by 7ilovelucy » Sun Sep 07, 2014 4:37 pmSo I have been doing some research online about PTSD, as my therapist thinks I may have it. However, all of the websites are the same, they all give the denotation, (dictionary deffiniton) but i am looking more for a connotation (personal deffiniton). I am basically asking what is your story? What triggered your PTSD? Was it multiple different events? How has it affected your school/work life? How has it impacted relationships with friends and family? Do you talk about the trauma a lot, to the point where it annoys people? Are you on any meds? Do you ever get angry for 'no reason'? Are you emtionally numb (have difficulty feeling love and hapiness, but feel negative emotions)?Basically just everything. I just want to see if some of my symptoms line up with other people with PTSD. Lately I have been feeling almost Bipolar because of my anger, but someone had said that, that could be PTSD related.Any answers are appreciated in advace, thank you!
