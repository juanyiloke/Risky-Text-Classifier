I miss my anorexia?!I feel like im actually almost fully recovered now. im weight restored and i dont care for major restricting anymore! i never thought i would get this far but it has taking me a long time. so even though im nearly recovered, i still have minor relapses occasionally. I crave for my small body and it feels like someone close to me (anorexia) has died and i will not be able to see them again and it really upsets me. i dont know why but i cant remeber any of the bad things i experienced at my worst points. i can only remeber being small and happy although logically i know thats not the case because i lost alot of friends/family and pretty much mucked up my education so obviously i was not happy or funcitoning adequately at all. so why i can only see myself as being the happiest i ever was when i was at my lowest weight i dont know becuase it should of been my unhappiest time right?! i dont know if this makes any sense but yeah was just wondering if anyone else gets like this? thanks x
