Is Ptsd Just An Evolutionary Outdated Adaptation Mechanism?HeyJust a thought that came to me, and am curious what people think. Nowadays we think of PTSD as an mental injury or illness but could it be, that it once served the purpose of changing people into better surviving extremely harsh conditions? The hypervigilance, the increased startleresponse, the constant fight and flight, the anger and mistrust, light sleep, those could all be understood as the mind powering up the survival instincts. I sometimes feel like a cavemen surrounded by hippie aliens anyway, so that would fit nicely. If that were the case, would that not open a nice path for easing into the diagnosis and accepting of oneself and the new situation a sufferer has to live in? "Your survival instincts are permanently powered up and cant switch off anymore, because of blah....." sounds so much nicer then "You are permanent damaged because shit got to tough." Also interesting to me would be the question what changed? Why is it outdated now. The answer would be, I believe, the creation of societies that take care of some things, but demand others in return and the PTSD state is not suited for that kind of environment. Am I being totally silly here? Stating the obvious? This feels like stoner thoughts lol, but I am not stoned. Well, maybe a little.
