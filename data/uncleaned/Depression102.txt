I think I'm going to lose my job because of my depression I have had depression for many years - there have been times when it has been worse and times when it has lifted. I started a new job just over six months ago. It was a huge step forward for me in my career but it also came with a massive amount of pressure. I have been so depressed these past few weeks. I have gone back on to my antidepressants but I still have constant suicidal thoughts. I cry a lot and am hugely behind with things at work. I think I am going to lose my job because of this. I can't see any way out of my situation.Work block Struggling through one of my toughest periods of depression at the moment. Trying to carry on working and keep up with things. Recently I've become focused on this one project I have to do for work and I just can't get any further with it. The deadline for it has long passed and I just keep saying to people 'I'm working on it. Nearly there.' I'm terrified I'm never going to be able to do it (it's one of my key performance indicators) and stress about this is making me exhausted all the time and affecting other things I am doing.I've tried breaking it down into small chunks. I can't even seem to write a sentence.What can I try to get through this?
