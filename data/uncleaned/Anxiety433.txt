I wish my body would make up its mindSometimes my anxiety is just confusing.Ê Can't there be one good side effect from this?Ê I mean, how do I have so much anxiety/energy that I can't sleep at night yet no energy during the day?Ê And if my mind is always racing and over active, why am I always slow to remember stuff and unmotivated.Ê Apparently I am getting rushes of adreneline yet I am always cold and don't have energy to work out.Ê When I finally do fall asleep at night, my body wakes me up in 2 hours.Ê During the day, it wants me to go to sleep I'm so tired.Ê Make up your mind body!ÊEeeeeeeekThis is WAY too close to home.Ê Tonight an active shooter was at a park about 10 minutes from my house!Ê I live in a very quite city that is known in the United States as one of the safest places to live.Ê There are three people dead and two injured with the shooter in custody.Ê You never think it could happen in your back yard but it just has and it scares me to death.Ê I run on a city trail every Tuesday and now I am scared that someone could come out and shoot me.Ê Of course having anxiety doesn't make this any better.Considering a SSRI for existential / de realization anxietyi was on cymbalta years ago and found no benefit to it. Now stricken with anxiety instead of depression during cymbalta use, I'm considering trying a new one.My anxiety is a existential anxiety, mostly at night time. I feel like I'm free falling and I'm about to hit the ground and die any time.ÊWould an SSRI help with this you think? Seeking any opinions whatsoever, considering any options. As well as feedback on which medication, or therapy worked for others.
