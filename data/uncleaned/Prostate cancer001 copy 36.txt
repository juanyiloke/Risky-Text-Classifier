TURP coming up! Hi all, I was diagnosed PC in February this year and have been on HT for the last three months with the requirement of needing a TURP procedure in the very forthcoming future, no date but on the surgeons list to be done asap, has anyone else had this small op and if so does it impact or affect your life at all ie how long recovery to be able to get back to work or any problems while recovering?It is better to be informed by people that have gone through it rather than read of a general information sheet that gives a list of everything and anything that might occur (helpful but not based on having gone through it).Once this procedure is done I will be looking forward to RT starting in 2 months, hopefully it will all be for the better!.
