  Advice to people who are on the end of their life.Hi,I just wanted to share an advice to people in here. I know a lot of you have gone through a lot of terrible stuff and even more of you still are. I know that the circumstances of life can be hard to deal with and to a point, quite unjustified. I know that some people are mean, evil and wants to do others harm. I know that life can be cruel and meaningless. However, there are hope.I have been through almost everything in terms of abuse and raw pain. Physical beatings, abused as a child, abandoned, alone, emotional pain, psychological pain, harassment, everything. However, even though i am torn apart by now, i am still fighting while trying to move forward. My mother is sick, and i was teared apart, however i still manage to help her and take of her, even though i can barely take care of myself. No one is helping me but yet i still manage to survive. I am slowly taking care of my own messed up life, i am slowly starting to see a small light at the end of the tunnel. Even though i may be alone in the darkness, i keep fighting to survive and ultimately win.So let this be an inspiration for you. Whatever you have been through, i most likely have as well. However, if you decide to let your inner warrior take up the fight, you can win the war by taking small steps at a time and conquering small territories. Do not surrender and do not give up to suicide. Everyone deserves to life a great life, and those who feels suicidal deserves it even more!!
