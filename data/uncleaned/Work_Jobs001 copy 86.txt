Can I be forced to work?________________________________________I'll try to keep this as short and clear as possible. I've been in my current job two years, and I share my role with one other person. We are the only two in the company who are fully trained in this role, however there are 4-5 other people in different departments who are able to cover leave when necessary. Myself and the other girl booked the same day off over 6 weeks ago. We approached management on the same day, requesting the day off, and made it quite clear that we both needed it, and were told it was no issue and someone from another department would cover.Two weeks ago said manager handed in his notice, but my colleague and I double checked that our booked time off still stood and I was told it did.Fast forward to today where upon hearing that we both have the same day off, my new manager (who isn't new to the company and had been in a more junior role the last few years) says absolutely no way can we both have it off, because we will be very busy and they can't spare someone from a different department to cover us. I now have to work as I am more senior in the role than my colleague is.I'm meant to be going to a wedding next week, I've dropped Û150 on a dress, Û70 on shoes, booked a hotel room and hair appointments etc. and now I'm being told I can't have the day off with only one weeks notice even though I requested this day off over 6 weeks ago.I'm an exemplary employee, I haven't requested a day off since last July. In my two years working I haven't rang in sick once. I'm so furious and upset that I may have to miss an important family event when I had previously been told its no problem.New manager is saying we should never have been grated the leave in the first place. We have no HR and he is the only manager, and is the most senior person in the company. The owners are always in and out but would have no interest in getting involved in an issue like this.Can they force me to work or can I refuse? Any advice appreciated, thanks
