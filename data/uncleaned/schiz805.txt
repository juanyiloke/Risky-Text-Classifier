i touch on this a bit at http:// .com/health/i-can-t-sto p-harming-myself-t169338.html ok so i'm hearing voices and seeing, what can only be described as, shadow men. they stand in every corner of the room, staring at me, whispering to me, telling me all sorts of things. my partner knows i see and hear things but i haven't told him that they talk to me. i think he's caught me talking to them before but i'm not sure. i'll tell them to leave me alone, that they're wrong with what they say, even though i know they're not really.
