From worker drone to middle management- need help2013-02-21, 02:45 PMI will be taking the step up to middle management, more like project lead. I have been a worker drone most of my career and now I will have to manage about 3-5 people in an IT setting. I won't have control over hiring or firing, basically tracking the project and assigning work.ÊSo my request, any sites, books, or material that you might have found very helpful in this type of transition or teaching on managing or leading? This is a path to bigger things in the future, so I want to make sure I get off on the right foot on this project.
