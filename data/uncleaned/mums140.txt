Seriously, tantrums!! I was hoping that it would start at two  DD is 14 months old, has learnt to climb, usually onto the cupboard and trying to knock the tv off the cabinet. I've moved the cupboard into my bedroom now, but god, she is testing my patience.She will walk over to the tv, try and reach it. She cant. She will try and climb up - there is nothing there for her to climb (the shelves are hidden by the door).She throws herself onto the floor, screaming and crying, has head-butted the floor on more than one occasion, her little face goes bright red.I've tried going near her to pick her up, she's started to head-butt me now and is always bruising me by pinching and biting me. I don't give her no reaction, she will try again. I leave her alone, she'll come walking to me after she realises I'm not there, will bite and pinch me again.I tell her no it hurts, she laughs and does it again Any little thing will set her off, the wrong food, can't find her "baba", the cartoon has finished. Little monkey only does it with me, not to DH. He's seen first hand what she's like, he'll step in and calm her down in seconds. I do the exactly the same, world war three breaks out!She hates the pushchair, she hates walking, hates being carried, hates being told no! (she copies this and drives me into hysterics pointing her finger shouting no no no )She's not tired, not ill, not teething just very independent (God help me haha!)She is way too young for any disciplinary actions and I don't want too do it to her. She's a little madam at times but she's my baby.Is this relatively normal for tantrums? I thought she was a little young for them or is this going to be the case of me turning grey in the next few years until she out grows them??
