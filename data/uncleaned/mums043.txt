Can anyone help with suggestions on how to build my almost 8yo DS's confidence?I think he hasn't quite found his place in the world yet and his confidence is already being affected and it really worries me how bad it may get in the future.He struggles academically at school (undiagnosed but the school believe he's dyslexic and dyspraxic) He's not sporty and unfortunately his class of (21 boys) are hugely into football and he gets comments made about being the worst in the class at football etc as some kids do.ÊHe's very gentle and kind hearted (his younger brother is completely the opposite, he's rough and ready.)ÊI've noticed his confidence being worn down and he's beginning to make comments about himself that make my heart break for him.He really is a lovely child and I want to help him see that but don't know where to start!
