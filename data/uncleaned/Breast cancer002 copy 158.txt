FEC Chemo and side effects.¥	Hi, hope someone can answer a couple of questions for me.¥	I am now 11 days post chemo, I have been extremely lucky and the side effects from my FEC haven't been too bad at all. Will this be the case for all my doses of FEC or will I feel progressively worse each time? Some days it feels like I havn't  been given anything at all!!¥	Also I am waiting for my hair to fall out as was told it's almost certain it will with FEC. No signs at all at the moment. Is it wishful thinking?¥	My Iron levels and wbc count were really good when I started so is this why I have been relatively unaffected by side effects??¥	Hope someone who has had this treatment can answer my questions. Thankyou. Debbie. xx
