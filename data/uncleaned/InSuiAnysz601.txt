Expreience project
I've tried to avoid my my temptation of suicide through drugs, pretending to fit in and be perfect.. I try to feed others their delusion of normality, every time I've reached out I'm called pathetic, a drama queen, a waste of energy. Nobody cares. The people who are supposed to care don't even notice, surely hose closest to you should notice?
I've attempted suicide multiple time but failed due to my misbelief that there is hope out there.
I don't want it to hurt, I want it to be a peaceful fall into nothingness. No bullshit, no on to tell me what I can or can't do, no one trying to pick my brain and try to tell me WHO I AM.
I'm going through great lengths of research to find the perfect way for me to go.
High building, no bullshit, 20 stories at least to ensure a quick fall at a good distance and 100% certainty of fatality.

**** conforming to how the world wants US to be. Time to be free. I don't fit it, nobody loves me, I'm alone, I reach out and I'm made a laughing joke of.
No point if no one cares.
