Being made redundant - should I take this job?________________________________________HiI am being made redundant after 13 years of service in a company. Since hearing my fate, I have been applying for roles - but having no feedback, excepting 1, where I was interviewed, was told the job was mine, but I declined because the commute was huge.Now, I have the opportunity to take a 6 month cover contract, in a company where a friend works - timing re my current role and new role starting is perfect - but there are a couple of personal considerations I need to 'consider':- What if my 'perfect' job came up in the meantime ie while I was on this 6 month contract role (would I peev off my friend?)?- there is alot of travel around Ireland in this role - but have 2 young children who would now be in FT childcare (they werent in my previous role)- Money for contracted role is ok - not brilliant, but not too bad either- I have exams this summer, so would be looking for time off / study leave...if possible!What you think? Given nothing re biting elsewhere...would I be mad to give this up?Unknown....
