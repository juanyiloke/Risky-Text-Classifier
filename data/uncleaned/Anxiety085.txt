is my attack needs doctors attention? Ê7    Hi all.. Im Hurley 32 from Singapore. i wants to share my experience with you guys. im unsure if i am okay or i need a further examine by the doctor. here is my story.6 months  , i had my first panic attack. i alarmed the whole house as i was having difficulties in breathing. i thought i was having a heart attack. but my brother confirmed that im not having it as i dont feel any chest pain or show any symptom of heart attack. eventually after drinking hot water and apply ginger lotion on my chest, i fell asleep. Went to the doctor the next day and doc confirm i was stress after he examine me.i was not convinced. somehow the short of breath continues for few months till today. it gets worst when i started to google.below are the list of attack i went thru in order:those are the list i went thru and guess what.. the moment i know i can deal with the attack, it will go to the next attack. now im back to no.1 which is the short of breath.total number of GP i went was 7 times. and all doctors diagnosed the same thing. ANXIETY/PANIC ATTACK. no meds was given as doc dont want me to depend on it too much. doctor also advise me not to go to the A&E as i will waste the doctor's time.
