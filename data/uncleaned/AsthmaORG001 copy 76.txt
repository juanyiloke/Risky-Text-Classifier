Started Seretide 3 days ago - benefits already? For the last 6-7 weeks i've been trialling being on Fostair and it didn't improve my asthma at all, in fact at the beginning it got worse!!!!Last thursday i saw the nurse for a review and i told her that the Fostair made no difference so she changed me onto Seretide.That was literally 3 days ago and i *think* i'm already starting to feel positive benefits of the Seretide. I always take my reliever before i do any exercise (which in itself is annoying cos a few years ago i didn't need to but now i do) but even so i usually really struggle with running - more or less all the way round whatever the distance.Yesterday i did ParkRun which is 5k / 3 miles and my breathing felt really good for about the 1st 2 miles, though by the end i was my usual coughing self. This morning i went out and ran 2.5 miles and only walked for a very short distance about half way round. Last time i tried to run on 2 consecutive days everything hurt - feet / breathing etc I also think it has taken less time than normal for me to fully recover Is it actually too soon for me to really be feeling the benefits or is it a case of "I'm taking it so it must be working"
