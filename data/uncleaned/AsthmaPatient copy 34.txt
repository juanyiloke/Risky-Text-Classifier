Exercise induced asthma? A couple of years ago, I quit smoking and starting exercising. I saw a doctor because I had difficulty breathing while exercising and the doctor suggested it was exercise induced asthma (prescribed inhaler). I never really took it seriously, because I thought maybe it was just from the smoking, and well, I just wasn't serious enough about quitting and such (didn't last long at all).Fast forward 5 years or so to now. I've been smoke free for over 3 months, didn't have any problems with a cough after quitting. Started exercising and a calorie deficit perhaps 1.5 months after quitting (need to lose about 20kg) and it was okay. Found myself a little short of breath but nothing out of the ordinary for someone quitting I guess. After 2 months of pretty intense exercise, I've found my breathing getting more and more difficult, and now I have developed quite a wheezy cough. It starts during exercise and lasts through to the next day now.Is it likely exercise induced asthma or something else because of my smoking history? I thought at over 3 months in my physical condition would be getting better, not worse? I also get a blocked nose all the time which makes things even more difficult, a problem I've yet to find a solution to.I know I should see my doctor, but I've seen her recently for other problems coming up from exercise, and I feel it's just another thing and she'll tell me to back off (I shouldn't feel that way but I do). So looking for advice really.
