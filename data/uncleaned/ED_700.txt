Pretty disgusting and embarrassing....This is actually quite gross and I feel quite bad writing it, but I just want to know others experiences of purging really...I'm not sure but perhaps the following could be potentially triggering?I've been B/P'ing for a number of years on and off, though the past year Ive been doing it on average twice a week. I've found that when I first started doing it again, it was quite difficult to bring up food. However, when I do it now, as soon as I do it to myself, it's a lot and it goes absolutely EVERYWHERE...ÊDoes anyone experience this? Sorry to be so graphic and gross there, I just perhaps want some reassurance that I'm not the only 'messy' purger, and perhaps some advice on how to manage it a bit better?
