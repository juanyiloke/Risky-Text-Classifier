16months on from a big operation im getting worried again..thought things were on the up but past week has been soo bad. When I first started with problems I had a pain in my right side especially at night, I was sent for loads of tests with in a 12 month period. I basically felt like they didn't believe I felt ill. Cut a long story short I had rectum cancer at the age of 45 !!! I was told I must have caught it early because of my age but in fact it was stage 3 and had spread to a lymph node. two operations later, the first one went extremely wrong may I add my pain in the side was I was told just a red herring !! because the pain in my side had nothing to do with my rectum cancer what so ever. Strange and worrying this is the pain started back up soon after but my surgeon said it was probably just my muscles getting use to being moved around with the operation. Now my pain this week has been extremely painful. I feel like I have heavy period pains down below, burning sensation in my lower tummy and pain in my side through to my back. Do I ring doctors? Go at accident and emergency or just wait a bit longer. I feel angry because I don't want to go down the route of sitting in hospitals again Ijust want my life be normal.
