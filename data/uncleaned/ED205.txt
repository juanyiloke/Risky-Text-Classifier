 ?laxative addictionI have pretty much for the last 15 years been pretty dependent on laxatives.I cant go to the loo at all now without them. I do the fruit, lots of water, plenty of veges etc,Nothing works then I cant stand the bloated uncomfortable feeling of being constipated If i dont take the laxatives even for several days i still cant go.The only laxatives that work is the stimulant one 'dulcolax'Last week I used heaps of laxatives and it got to the point where I was going constantly.I felt like crap but loved that empty feeling.I feel its too late now to get my bowels back to how they should be functioning.I from a teenager started using them but generally not a stimulant I used coloxyl-a bowel softener or a bulking agent they dont work at all, even in huge quantities I disagree that this is a weight issue its (i argure with myself) because i just cant go.Any suggestions?
