Pushing the cloudsI made two posts venting how I feel, and I feel better. I thank all of you involved with this site. Venting to friends and family causes much worry and distress. I am grateful there's a place with like minded people to open up to. I honestly didn't think it would help. I guess I needed to get it out to push the clouds. Though they will come again, I am comforted with knowledge that I can release it. Holding on to angst is the only burden I have anymore. Again, thank you. I am inspired and I am relieved.
