I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI became extremely depressed to the point of suicide and I lied to my friend about having schizophrenia and then I lied to her about getting help 3 times, because I didn't have schizophrenia and couldn't see I had a real problem. I messaged her more than enough a couple times. She called my parents and they took me to the hospital and I was there 2.5 months. A couple days after going into hospital I text her and she didn't answer. I kept texting because I didn't understand why she wasn't talking to me (even though I had lied). Then she called the police saying I was harassing her when I just asked to talk. I knew this person for 12 years and been good friends. I'm feeling like I should be understood but what I did to her was really bad. I feel so guilty. This happened months ago and I still feel horrible about myself. She never gave me the time of day to talk she wouldn't. I know what i did wasn't what a friend would do but no one is ever going to understand me. I feel really judged and guilty!
