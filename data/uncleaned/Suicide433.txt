I'm ready to give up.JI’m not afraid of dying. I’m afraid of surviving. I’ve pretty much accepted the idea that death is great and peaceful and the answer to everything and I want it so bad.I’ve been trying to get xanax and alcohol to overdose and die in my sleep. But I cant get it..I just feel like I’ll never get better. I’ve struggled with depression all my life. Had a series of breakdowns. In high school it got really bad and I was forced to therapy which helped a little but we stopped. Went to college and I relapsed, ended in the hospital for suicidal thoughts, got forced to see doctors and stuff. And that’s where I’m at right now. I’m 19, I have no relationship with my family, no friends who care, I hate my therapist and my psych, they don’t seem to really care about me and all theyre doing is pumping meds into me and hoping its working. But the meds aren’t even working. Ive been on celexa (antidepressant) for a while and they increased the dosage recently and I still don’t feel better. I won’t get better. I know I won’t get better. And so what’s the point of trying? No one cares about me at all. I have no friends, I have no family. No one cares about me. And I don’t care about anyone. I just want to die.I just don’t know how.. I can’t buy a gun. I don’t have a garage to die of carbon monoxide. I can’t get xanax.. I don’t know what to do and I feel so helpless I’ve been drinking alcohol just to feel better but its fucking me over even more..
