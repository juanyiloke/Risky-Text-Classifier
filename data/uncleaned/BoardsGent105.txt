Widowers and other lonely older men; what options have they for socialising?Back at home, when my dad died, in spite of my mam never really being involved in the community and being very close to a hermit, a whole load of women from all over the area started dragging her to all these events. A lot of the events seemed to be constructed specifically for widows and women who were living alone. These seemed to be organised by other women in the community and generally got a bit of support even if they were things that most of the women had no interest in (yoga died a death after about 4 weeks, but a lot of them seemed to give it a shot).Meanwhile, when any local man's wife dies back home, regardless of whether he's an outgoing type or not, there just doesn't seem to be any options available. There's definitely a certain inevitability towards any attempts made to create a means of socialising would fall flat, and they always do.Was just wondering whether the situation is better in more urban areas? Why exactly is it that it seems so hard to create a regular social gathering type thing for older men? If there is resistance to the idea of it, what is that borne out of? Are the efforts not trying to replicate the system for women too much when perhaps a different approach might work? Is it somehow an issue that applies to men of all ages but becomes a greater issue when they get older or is it a generational thing which is already showing signs of improving in some places?Yeah, hope I'm making some sense. Looking forward to any answers/hypotheses which you may have, thanks.Ê
