Don't really want to talk...Hi, I am new to this. Haven't really spoken to anyone about how I feel, just slightly mentioned to two friends quite a while ago but that's it. Don't even think they remember anymore. I haven't been diagnosed, don't really want to go to a GP. I don't want to tell someone how I feel who just listens to you because they get paid for it. Also, I don't want to tell anyone I am close with to not make them feel bad. I have moved to Australia a few years ago as I thought I might be happier here or at least I would be ok with being by myself as I didn't know anyone here. I found friends but moved again because of a new job so I am by myself again. I don't have problems meeting or talking to people but currently I don't want to meet anyone anyways. I feel so lonely, especially not having a partner - have been single for a long time - and this is what probably frustrates me most. I feel like I won't find anyone who really cares about me. I don't want to do this anymore but I would feel bad for my siblings and parents if I did something to myself. Didn't really want to talk about anything and especially not whinge as I know this doesn't help but I don't know what would help. Depression medicine would be good but that means talking to someone who doesn't know you and doesn't care about you. Anyone else feels the same?
