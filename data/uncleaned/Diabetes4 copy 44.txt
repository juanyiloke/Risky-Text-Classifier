Help. I need to start againI wasn't quite sure where to post this.I need to start again with taking control of my diabetes, it's been long enough. I've not seen under 10 on my meter on the rare occasion I use it recently. I Just got a 14.4 4 hours after eating and I'm scared.  Clearly my metformin is not working well anymore and I've reached the stage where I am eating and eating and eating as I'm always hungry as the energy isn't getting through, which is how I was before I was diagnosed. I'm not sure how to take control and to be honest I feel frightened.
