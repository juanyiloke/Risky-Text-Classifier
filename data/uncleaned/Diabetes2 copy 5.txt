Low Bloodsugar and head rush?I am type 1 diabetic and lately I have been having many lows and I notice that when I stand, my vision clouds for maybe 2-3 seconds, and then I'm fine. Could this be a result of the bloodsugar?I also have a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (non-obstructive) and a defibrillator in my chest.  My blood pressure has been low only once in my life and that was when they diagnosed me with this condition.  My blood pressure/heart rhythms have been perfect ever since.  I am very active and have never fainted or felt dizzy from exercise, so I don't think this problem is heart-related.  Do you think it's just the bloodsugar level?
