Hey I don't have insurance and haven't checked a doctor yet but kinda worried. I've been coughing really bad for 3 weeks. There is always a feeling of mucus in throat and lungs but its a dry cough. I always am producing mucus in my nose but its usually stuffed and not dripping out. I am really worried. I've tried cleaning my room, multiple cough medines, water, cough drops, onions, lemons,garlic, and steam all to no affect. The only thing that clears up my lungs temporarly is intense running however I think its just the heart rate makes me think less of my breathing.
