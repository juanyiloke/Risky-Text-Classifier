Imaginary heart palpitations and other symptoms?I've been to the ER twice this week for chest pain and palpitations, along with a couple other times over the past year. Both times I went to the ER they put me on the EKG monitor(the "permanent" one that runs to the nurses station) and over the course of several hours experienced ZERO heart palpitations, even though I FELT like I said several.Only one time have my palpitations actually been recorded(i'm getting fitted for a holter monitor next week)j but I'm starting to wonder if these symptoms are even real. Is it possible for some of my anxiety symptoms to be entirely in my head? The doctors ran tests for everything(thyroid, blood sugar, electrolytes, gall bladder) and can't find anything wrong with me.I figure if schizophrenia can make people see and hear people that aren't actually there, it could be possible for the body to experience physical symptoms that may not be there as well. Is there any factual evidence to support this?
