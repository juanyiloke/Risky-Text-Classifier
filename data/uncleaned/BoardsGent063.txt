What do you consider normal social drinkingI don't drink much and would be happy to go to a pub and have 2 or 3 drinks now and then or a few glass of wine at the weekend, my husband does not drink much, I come from a family of light or non drinkers so maybe my view of this is a bit squid. I was listening to a discussion on this and drinking 8 pints in one go every weekend was seen as normal by a lot of people??So as I said what in your opinion is normal social drinking by amount.
