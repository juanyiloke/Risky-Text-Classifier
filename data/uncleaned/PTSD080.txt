Moving Day - A Good But Scary Next StepToday was my first day in my new apartment. Tomorrow will be my first night there. A lot of you have seen the struggles that I've had with potentially unhealthy relationships and my living situation shifting pretty frequently because of it. With the support of my T I recognized the unhealthy patterns and built confidence to find a place of my own. I got approved last week and was extremely excited because I was approved and I had a new chance at happiness in front of me. The hard part was breaking the news to my very close friend who I lived with. The relationship had not been going well for many months but I love her and respect her. She has been part of my life for so many years and I have a very strong attachment and comfort being around her. Her response threw me into a grief induced panic attack and I've had nights I've cried the entire night without sleeping at all. I felt broken and helpless but today since its moving day the hope came back a little. I was excited to start moving in and decorating. I can see myself there happy making healthy relationships with my own place to come back to. After moving all day though and seeing my friends disappointed face I just got so overwhelmed with sadness, loneliness, and fear of the future. I feel like I need her approval for this step. She is my everything but I know I need to do this. I am back at my old place now in my room relaxing for my last night here and I want to never leave. Its a fresh start tomorrow. Its a good one and a necessary one but a scary one. It would be really helpful to have support through this as I my overwhelm can spill over at any point and if you can and want to just check in. It really would help me through. Thanks.
