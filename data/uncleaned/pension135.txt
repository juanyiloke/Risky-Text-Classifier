Horn of AfricaThe new threat there from both war and draught needs £40 million in urgent aidI would suggest the government takes some of the £660 million it has earmarked for Pakistan and channel it thereThey keep saying they have 'learned lessons' but after Band Aid more than 20 years ago have they learnt anything?Ê I would offer not as in 20 years they could have sunk deep wells to bring up water, unless I am mistaken if you drill deep enough you will always hit water.Just sending food and water is never going to solve this problem they need the aid spent of building an infrastructure so they become self sufficient.I do always wonder when I see the pictures of the starving children on TV why the adults in the main always look fed and in fact on the news last night they we actually very chubby faced.I know I am a cynic but I am afraid this time they will not be getting any donations from me I neither choose to add to the aid budget nor can I afford to support other countries in the way I once could - I'm a pensioner
