paid maternity leave________________________________________Hi guys Just wanted to get some advice, I work for a multinational who pay 100% salary for maternity leave with 2 years service. My problem is I have just found out that I am pregnant and would be due to take maternity leave in december. I would be working in the company 23 months by that stage. I have also got about 1 month of annual leave I haven't taken yet. Are there any rules about when maternity leave has to start? We are applying for a mortgage at the moment so having only 50% of my salary would be a disaster. I don' t want to approach Hr yet until I know what the rules are. If I could take the annual leave in December instead of maternity it would bring me up to 24 months.Anyone else been in this posiition?Thanks
