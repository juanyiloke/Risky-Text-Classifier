2 steps forward 1 step backI don't feel like I am getting any better, my antidepressants were changed as the ones I was taking were causing all sorts of side effects I have been on the new ones for  5 days now . My sessions with the counsellor have been hard and I leave them feeling good, however, last night I seemed to have a relapse and had suicidal thoughts and spent most of the night crying the same as I am doing now. I know Im supposed to do things however, I don't want to do anything.
