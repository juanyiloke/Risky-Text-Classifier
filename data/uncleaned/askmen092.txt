Ethical question about applying for a job: Lie about current situation?2012-09-13, 12:54 AMSo in short, here's where I am:- Planned to move to Seattle in October- Was led to believe I was a shoe in for a job in Seattle- Came out a month early (last Wednesday)- yada yada yada- The job didn't pan out, so I'm unemployedI'm sending my resume out. Hopefully with a local address and phone number I'll get good responses and all that fun stuff.OKHere's my question:I'm thinking that in the interim (assuming it might take a couple months to get a solid job in my field) that I'll apply for jobs at Safeway or something like that. Just a job to keep busy and give me some income. I'm fortunate enough to be living with family out here, and while I'll offer to pay rent, I have very low cost of living at least for now.Now here's REALLY the question:For a job like being a grocery clerk at Safeway, I am way over qualified in terms of education and salary history. I was thinking that I would put on my resume that I'm doing contract work, and that the Safeway job would just be a steady source of baseline income for me.Would that be grossly unethical?
