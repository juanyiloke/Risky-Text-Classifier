fml epilim really?by SBBro » Tue Oct 07, 2014 7:51 amI'm 30 single only officially been diagnosed with ocd and gad. But I know i have high functioning autism, borderline pd and ptsd.My ptsd is relationship, drug and doctor induced. Pretty much bpd is swept under the carpet in Australia until you present an acute lethal danger then they still don't dx you with anything.I've had ptsd since 2005, I can't trust doctors anymore, had cancer misdiagnosed, botched surgery, was given #######5 advice that my autistic mind failed to interpret.I'm ###$ because the ptsd is the medical professions fault so i can't get proper systematic treatment.Anyway I'm on 150mg sertraline/zoloft. Switching from risperidone to olanzapine micro dose in phases of environmental stress for bpd. And now I need a mood stabalizer because after i get message therapy I become so depressed i get extremely paranoid.My doctor says I have a thought disorder, I think I have a mood disorder. Unless ptsd is a thought disorder? I'm not impulsive just illogical.I don't want to work until this $#%^ is treated, work is just a distraction.So anyway anyone else get depressed after massage therapy? Can anyone recommend something for severe mood swings? Epilim worries me because of hair loss and weight gain.
