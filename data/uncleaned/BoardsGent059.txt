Putting clothing items on pub floorsI was out with a couple of friends recently, and while chatting I placed my jacket on the pub floor which apparently shocked them. There were no coat hooks on the bar, no cloakroom and the chair was cushioned so I couldn't comfortably sit on the bulky jacket nor place it behind me on the back so I put it on the ground by my feet. The floor looked clean enough, it was early in the evening so not too busy and I just didn't think it was as shocking a thing to do as they thought!ÊAnyway I know it's not a very serious matter but what do others think?
