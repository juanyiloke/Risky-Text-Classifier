  Id like to update my story :)Ok i was severely depressed over loosing friends and a drug problem. I had a dark past i am not proud of. But to some it up i posted on here i was going to kill myself. In an odd turn of events someone stopped by later tha night to find me near death. Afterwards i was not allowed out of a hospital for awhile and so on... I got out and i decided to go back to my hometown to take a trip down memory lane. I got better and better after this :). I started to hang out with friends again, started to workout again, and ultimately got money again too. I continued tk help myself and others, being a handyman fixing my friends cars and houses. I felt better about myself than ever! I was starting to fill out in body shape from working out, this got the attention of females :). I landed a small job, and im happy to be here! I just really have to say the depression is there, but my life overshadows it. I also have to say that i have been moved by someone on here that i would like to consider a friend even though weve never met. Thank you aries for telling me i could be useful and happy again, im so glad you told me so i could get myself to where i am today! :D
