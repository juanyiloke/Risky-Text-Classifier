ÊCan't copeI feel like all eating disorder therapy has done for me is make me lose control of my eating and get fat. I still have all the same thoughts and feelings about my weight, shape and food and I can't cope. I feel like I have become addicted to junk food. I want my willpower back because I can't cope being like this and just eating all the time. Why didn't they help me with my body image issues and my need to be in control all the time? What is the point in Cognitive Analytic Therapy? I feel so let down.
