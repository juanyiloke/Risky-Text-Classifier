Why do I make noises, and find it very difficult to stop?Hello,This is my first post, so pardon me if I make mistakes or if I am not thorough enough.The issue:I make odd noises e.g. partial cough, lip noises and other strange noises (Some are VERY hard to explain). I can control these noises, although I find it very difficult to do so most of the time, and I have to make a conscious effort to stop.About a week and a half ago I developed bronchitis about a day or two into it I developed a partial cough (habit??). I know that I'm making the noise, and it's embarrassing, but like I said it's hard for me to stop. I make the noise quite often usually several to up to 10-15 times in a minute. I have noticed that when my mind is fairly distracted that I do not make the noises. I recall having this issue since I was young, at the age of about 7 or so. I usually develop some type of noise making habit about idk... every 1 or two months.As far as my mental health diagnosis goes I have:General Anxiety DisorderSocial Phobia (I am still a pretty outgoing person, but I can get nervous in crowds etc.)Depression Moderately Severe (intermittent)Hopeful Outcome:I really would like to figure out what the diagnosis would be so I can get help such as medicaton/counseling. Any information would be very appreciated, and thank you in advance!
