AngerHi all...My story is long (as all of ours tend to be). I am coming off of medication (under dr supervision). I have PTSD from a  past trauma. My issue is that as I am coming off of my meds (tappering and almost off). I do notice my quick temper and anger surfacing. Granted not as bad as before and I am catching myself. But, for the sake of my marriage I can't go backwards like I was before. I do exercise and journal and meditate. So these things help. But what do you do to catch yourself and stop before flying off the handle with your partner or loved one?
