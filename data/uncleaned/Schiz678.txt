Ê"Psychosis" and "Schizophrenia"???For ten years now I have had at least five different random doctors say that they thought I had schizophrenia however they always just write down psychosis down and their response is that once schizophrenia is written down you cant take it off your record....Its been ten years now and my new psychiatrist also just put down psychosis....I just want something you know? An answer to a loooong battle of questiions....Anyone else have this problem or have had this? What do I do? Just bare it and go with the flow?
