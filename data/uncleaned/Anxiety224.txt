Is this normal?Hi -I'm new to this forum, and newly diagnosed with anxiety. Specifically GAD and panic disorder. But anyway... so I have panic attacks from the "normal" things, but today I have been freaking out about things that aren't so "normal". I am moving into an apartment with someone this fall and that's all fine and dandy, and we are talking about furniture that we are bringing with us to the apartment. Originally, we agreed that I would purchase the living room furniture, it's what I preferred. But now my future roommate has somehow acquired some couches. And all I can keep thinking about is if the couches will look how I want them to look, if they will match the other furniture I have purchased, etc. I am panicking because I want the room to be a certain way, and even writing this now makes me feel so ridiculous, but I can't help it. I am even considering just living by myself just so that my apartment can be exactly how I want it.ÊAm I a freak? Is this just me being a ridiculous person? I have no idea how to control these feelings, and I feel like I'm going to explode!Thank you in advance for any helpful comments.Ê
