DC2 due at the end of the year (it's very early days)!ÊDS will be just 2 when baby arrives so I'm sure we'll need a double, def need an inline over a side by side.ÊCan anyone recommend the P&T Vibe or Navigator? Or the BJ City Select?I think I prefer the City Select but will no doubt change my mind a hundred times before buying!ÊIdeally I'd like baby parent facing, we have car seat already, and currently have a BJCGT. Fold actually not hugely important, but the comfort of both seats is.Thanks in advance!
