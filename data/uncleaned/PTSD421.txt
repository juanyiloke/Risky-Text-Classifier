ÊDoes distraction lead to a retrained brain?Hey everyone I may of posted here from time to time in the past but it's been a while. So hello to all. I've been in therapy for over a year now to help me overcome some of the stuff I've gone through, I'd like to leave the details out no offence. A little while ago the therapist got me to start doing a ritual, if you will, to do whenever he pops into my thoughts. What I do is snap my fingers twice to bring me back into the here and now. It really works!! I love it. The thing is when she asked me to do this she said I was training my brain which to me sounds like after time I would stop thinking about it less.ÊTime has made it easier to think about. Meaning I don't get flooded with emotions and my mood bounces back fairly quickly when it happens.ÊI still, however, think about him just as many times as before I just don't dwell on it as long because well I guess I've trained my brain to remember to snap during those thoughts. My question is should I be satisfied with this accomplished or can I expect to think less and less of him as time goes on? I see my therapist in 3 weeks but chose to ask people who would of actually tried this tactic before.ÊThanks, Chaotic
