ÊHit.Rock.Bottom - Anorexia Relapse/RecoveryHey all,Gosh I haven't been on the forum for a good good few months & here I am reaching out for some support. Story in short:* recovered from anorexia Feb this year* re-built my life, new career, big pay break, social scene etc* relapsed May this year - lost weight* 7 weeks ago I tried to take my life & ended up in a coma for 2 days in the ICU* Currently on home leave from psych ward for 1 week & discharge mtg on ThursdayBeing inpatient on a general psych ward was terrible as they couldnt support me with my eating & I lost further weight. Now on home leave I spend 1 week just numb with no emotion what so ever and constantly binging (which is something I have never done) I binged constantly for the whole of last week.Come this week, I obviously feel so guilty from last week I am a total mess. All of the thoughts and feelings that bought me to my overdose have come back in full force. I just feel so unsupported by my ED team who couldn't fit me in this week or help me plan out something to help me whilst I have been at home. I feel like I am bobbing along with my head just above the water and I might drown at any time. I'm so scared, blank and just feel pointless really.ÊPlease tell me that this eating disorder isn't forever, it's taken every aspect of my life away from me.
