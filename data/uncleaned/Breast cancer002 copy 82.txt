Breast clinic¥	Hi, was looking for feedback as I'm a little worried. I found a lump before Christmas, it was just a little tiny bump. An now things have changed. My breast is larger. I feel the heavyness. The lump is now noticeable to touch. My breast is changing, at one time the top of breast went flat as board with a chicken skin look. It lasted one day. Now my nipple points out wards if erect. Also it's not sore to touch but iv a pain which lasts most of the day, or it aches. Sometimes the pain goes to my armpit. Seen my Gp on Friday and she's referred me to breast clinic for tests, also MRI. Iv been on hrt for 7 years after total hysterectomy. Sorry for writing a essay.
