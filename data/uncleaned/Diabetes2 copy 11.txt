is my blood sugar level normal??  17  hi, I have gone through a body check and the blood sugar level was something like 5.7 ( empty stomach for 8 hours before the test) and the doctor said it was OK.  I have also tested it with free simple test around my living community and the result was 6.4 (2 hours after lunch)I know somebody could have 5.1 or 5.2 or even 4.x  something for empty stomach for 8 hours before test while  I have 5.7 .  I know 6.0 or 6.1 is the dangerous / warning line. Am I reaching the line or too close to it??Is there any saying that 5.6 is better than 5.7 or 5.5 is better than 5.6 ? My dad has Type II diabetes diagnosed at the age of 50. Am I at higher risk of developing diabetes later in my life or is it a disease that could be largely prevented by lifestyle change??Thank you
