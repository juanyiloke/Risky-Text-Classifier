Freestyle LibreWent to a lunch party today - nibbles before lunch, starter of quiche and salad, Lamb and date casserole with new potatoes, swede mash, broccoli and cauli followed by rhubarb crumble with a dollop of clotted cream and then a couple of cheese biccies with some nice stinky cheese.  All accompanied by wine (not too much, but steady).  Thanks to tracking this with the Libre I was able to dose as needed with the pump and the highest I have seen was 7.9.  Lunch started at 2pm and now at nearly 8pm I am 6.3.I am gonna miss this device when the current sensor runs out next weekend!
