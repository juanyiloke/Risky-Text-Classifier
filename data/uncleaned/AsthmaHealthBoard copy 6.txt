Need advice for my son please!________________________________________Hi everyone,My son is 4 years old. He is having horrible asthma right now and I don't know what to do or if my Dr. is doing the correct thing. I will make this as short as I can. They suspected virally induced Asthma so he was on an inhaler all winter. Come spring they took him off to see how he did. Last week he had a HORRIBLE cough - brought him in assuming bronchitis/pneumonia - nope just asthma. THey put him back on the daily inhaler and gave him oral steroids for 5 days. Saturday night he had a horribleasthma attack. He couldn't talk, he couldn't breathe, he was vomiting from the coughing. We got it under control with his rescue inhaler and another round of albuterol in the nebulizer. Brought him back in Monday. STILL horrible but good O2 at 96%. So now he's on Inpratomidium (sp?) in his nebulizer, along with albuterol 3 times a day. His daily inhaler twice a day AND oral steroids. He's better in the sense that he's not coughing that horrible asthmatic cough every single time he breathes but he still has the cough. It happens a lot, he still coughs till he gags and needs water. But he's not AS bad. He goes back Friday. What should I ask for or do from his Dr? Should I demand to be sent to a pulmonologist at this point?? Is this beyond what a ped. should do or is he being treated correctly? It just seems like a LOT of drugs for a little boy. Particularly when he's not getting 100% better. SHOULD he be 100% better by now? or do these things take a long time to get better after a severe attack?I am clueless. Thanks!!
