Phew....Hi everyoneNot been around much with all the changes in my life over the last year. Finally got around to arranging blood tests with my new surgery. It has been almost 2 years since I last had a review as I was due to have one at the old GP just before I moved, and the new GP only does the reviews annually depending on your birth month (August in my case)The actual review is next week so I'll be able to report on the new  after that, but I got the receptionist to give me my A1c which was 41 (5.9 in old money). So only a 0.1% increase on my previous one, which given the complete life change I underwent last autumn/winter, wasn't nearly as bad as I'd feared. I have settled into a new routine, I'm working and I cycle to work most days as well as the odd loooong cycle ride with L, but I still eat more carbs than I used to because I'm not in complete control of the menus here and I'm sometimes weak when faced with temptation.Sorry to neglect you all. I do look in most days but because I knew I was being a bit negligent with my eating, wasn't testing much and hadn't had a review in forever, I felt I didn't have anything to contribute really. I'm going to try and tighten up a bit on the food front, so I'll try and look in here more for motivation  L xx
