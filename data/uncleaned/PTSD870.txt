ÊJust been diagnosed with PTSDHi All,ÊI am new to this kind of thing. I was diagnosed with PTSD just Tuesday past and I am struggling to come to terms with what this means and what I do from now on. I have always known that the way I cope with things hasn't been great and I have suffered from some severe moods and flashbacks. I have been offered group therapy but I am not sure what to do as I really do need something that will help but I do not want my work to find out and getting 3 hours out of my working day every week is going to be a struggle. Should I be honest with my work and tell them or will that hinder my promotion prospects for the rest of my life in this company? I work in a close knit team who tell each other everything and I am worried about confidentiality too.ÊI have told my current partner about my diagnosis which we were both expecting due to the way I behave and what I have been going through; I am shocked, he is not. In fact he seems to be ignoring the fact that I am going through something. He is happy to give me a cuddle but doesn't really understand the gravity or upset I feel from this diagnosis. I don't know what I can do to make him see that I am not coping, on one hand I do not want to put any pressure on him to help and on the other I feel so alone as no one knows about this or seems to want to talk to me about it. I suppose there is a stigma and because all of my friends see me as a determined, hard working "shit together" type of person they have kinda gone into shock when I told them what happened (it was over 10 years ago) so I do feel a bit pathetic also.ÊI am really at a loss at what I should do - I am fighting the urge to curl up in bed all weekend and ignore the whole world but I know that it is not a helpful response and I do have two step children coming to stay the weekend so I really need to not appear unwell or upset.ÊAny advice greatly appreciated. I am hitting my head off of a brick wall.Ê
