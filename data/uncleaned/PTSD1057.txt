I'm 24 years old and was involved in a house fire two years ago. Since then I've split with my long-term boyfriend and not been able to form any other committed relationship. I have been suferring from insomnia regularly, which is impacting on my work situation. I don't think I have flashbacks. I'm always aware of where I am but certain smells and sounds make me unable to think about anything else for days at a time and causes me to become really emotional and unable to focus on anything.ÊI've been feeling really disconnected from my life for the last two years and I've finally come to the realisation that I need to get help. I'm just not sure where to go, or if this is something that will go away on its own.
