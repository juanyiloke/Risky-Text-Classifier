Êcould i be diagnosed with schizophrenia?im going to keep this short because ive got to go soon but I will eventualy make my life story explanation but anyways I just want to know if I goto my doctors if I have a good chance of being diagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar or schizoaffective because I have terrible anxiety and im afraid to goto the doctors incase he doesn't understand me and doesn't send me to see a psychiatrist I know I definatly have something I haven't been right all my life and I would just rather have myself labled as an illness instead of being that weird kid. okay so as a kid I grew up normal but I had signs I used to think and openly admit that I was the devils son and I used to say I was going to be evil when I was older and I used to hurt animals (which I really do regret down to have really bad empathy) and around 8/9/10 I had derealisation episodes which lasted 1 night each and for a kid that age I shouldn't be getting that and I also had OCD I had to do everything either 3 or 4 times but when I got to highschool at age 11 I would say my beginning life was fairly normal I was popular funny and had girlfriends then my first 2 years of highschool was pretty much fine I had derealisation episodes when I would stay up and do all nighters and I started playing games which I never used to play games I was always out also in my first highschool year it was a windy day and I used to love the wind but it was raining at the same time and I saw the wind pushing the rain and it scared me and introduced my fear of the wind from that day every windy day I paniced loads sometimes I would stay off school hide in cupboards and put real loud music on then the year after at age 12/13 I asked myself what happens if when we die theres nothing there and I went crazy with fear I cried myself to sleep every night and to me that was one of my major turning points. so the next year I was in new lessons with new people I didn't know so well and I for once in my life was afraid to speak up and being known as a very funny person and someone who speaks a lot this was weird for me and this is where my journey began. so the next couple of years things just piled up my anxiety got worse I masked all my emotions from people at school then eventualy my family and withdrew from everybody I got depressed and alone I didn't speak to anybody my anxiety only got worse I started taking at least 1 day off school a week my belief that I was the devils son turned into the devil then I belived I was god. my fear of the wind then turned into fear of thunder and rain and any bad weather at all if I saw an ambulance pass me I would worry that it was for my mum and if the phone rang and my mum answered it depending on her attitude towards the call I would worry that something happened and if a bus or car passed me I would start to imagine somebody that I know is in the car or bus and I would imagine their voice talking horrible things about me and sometimes I would think my life was being documented as a comedy show and people was trying to make me angry just so they could video and laugh at me sometimes I would think people can read my thought and I started being very suspicious of people and I didn't trust anybody but myself. as I left school I had 1 week in college then left because of anxiety then I had a year off where all I did was played games and I was distracted from life and got a break then after a year I went back to college and managed 7 months doing sports and even though I was excercising daily I got 1-3 hours sleep every night 4 days a week and my anxiety was still pretty bad but after 7 months I quit again I also stopped going to my hobby boxing because that's how I got my anger out so now I had no boxing and I started working with my dad and since hes my dad it makes my anxiety worse around him and I cant speak to him at all I maybe say like 20-30 words to him everyday and sometimes he makes me really angry it feels like a demon is twitching inside of me trying to get out and I almost smash his van up or his machines I have kept my anger in for 5 years though so I am good at it and anyways I started drinking because I turned 18 and it was quite good but I danced more then everyone ever I would take up the whole dance floor alone which could maybe be a sign of bipolar I would talk more even when sober I would sometimes feel so happy sometimes I would write really nice messages to people for no reason just so they feel as happy as me because I felt great but that happiness could easily turn into rage and then depression which could be a bipolar mood cycle and then I started smoking weed because I wanted to make myself dumb so I could deal with my problems easier and be less anxious but I never seemed to get high its like I wouldn't allow myself and its like my brain is too smart for weed all weed did was make my thought process slower but It was still the same as before and then my derealisation came back which was really bad and so I quit weed and only smoking it about 8 times after 2-3 months I felt as though I fully recovered but then a few months after my memory started getting worse and I was so in touch with reality I could see things for what they really are how society is just brainwashed people I feel like I am a really smart person but working again after Christmas break I started getting angry again then my anger made me sometimes think my dad was reading my mind and he knew he could get away with things so he kept making me do all the work and sometimes I thought that maybe he was training me for something or trying to make me tough or something and then after a few more months I had weird episodes of confusion sometimes I would close my eyes trying to sleep (oh by the way I always had sleeping problems not being able to sleep in highscool I would lay there for like 2-3 hours just to sleep) and then I would wake up confused like my mind was blank sometimes I would think that im not in my room this isn't my bed that's not my TV ect and I had some other weird episodes similar to that but anyways eventualy I experienced voices which weren't negative but very clear and they only happened during a really hot bath or while going to bed but I wasn't asleep and then I had an injury on a night out which got me some time off work and the voices went for about a week then came back but less severe then they faded away and ive just started work again about a week ago.ÊI know this is messy but sorry and I really have to go now so some things are missed out I know I probably should see a psychiatrist please don't comment that I need to see one what I really want to know is if you guys think I have a good chance to be diagnosed I don't want to goto the doctors just to be given medication or for him to say I don't have anything wrong with me because I have bad anxiety and it took me years to see a doctor before and all he said was "I think that's all down to anxiety" which I know for a fact its not because I had signs even before my anxiety was even bad and im not asking for an online diagnosis so don't worry just please give your honest opinions and if you read it all thank you so much. I hope to hear from you guys, bye.
