  Breathing problem for four months________________________________________Hey all, I'm brand new here and signed up to possibly get some advice/opinions on a health issue I've been experiencing for four months now. First a little background information about myself regarding illnesses: I was born with asthma, I have back and neck pain(doctors don't know why and believe it could be fibromyalga), and generalized anxiety disorder. My asthma has been in remission for a few years due to maintenance inhalers and my anxiety has been in check with the help of medication. One day I woke up with a frog in my throat, which I assumed was just allergies, and the inability to get a full breath or yawn. My symptoms have been: tight mid-section(feels like a rubber band around my diaphragm and torso), in attempts to yawn or get a large breath it feels like my lungs cut me off before it can finish(like 80% breath then my lungs hit a wall type thing), something in my throat pops(similar to when a bone cracks) when I swallow, but only when my head is tilted a little in either direction, (it isn't painful, just a discomfort), some days I wake up and my throat/oral cavity is extremely tight and I can't loosen it, and I've had flem/a froggy feeling constantly in my throat. I'm a saxophonist and this breathing issue bothers me more than usual is because I need all the air I can get. I've gone to the my dr. several times to which he has no answers for me. He suggested anxiety(I feel better than I normally do in that area as things are going well otherwise from this issue) or a blood clot in my lungs, which he said it's not likely because I'm 21. I'm really distraught about this issue because it has persisted for four months now, today I've realized that when I walk up the large flight of stairs in my school I get a little out of breath, but I feel a cold pressure right in the lower center of throat near the clavicle and I actually can get full breaths during that time. It feels like there is something in my throat during that time, but no other times. I'm very lost in this matter because my doctor has no idea how to help or what it is. Does anybody have any suggestions, advice, or opinions as to what might be causing this problem? Please, I'm desperate, any stories of similar events would help too. I just really need to find out what is going on and ASAP! Thank you everyone.
