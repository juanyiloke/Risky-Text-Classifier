Last pay from job less than expected??________________________________________Hi, wondering if anyone can help me. I left my last job on April 5th.The last pay I got from them was on march 29th, (for February's worked hours)I just got my pay 28th April and it's significantly lower than my basic salary was. (Usually Û1800, I got Û840) I had 20 days annual leave remaining when I left, and I had taken a week holidays in jan (days carried over) & a week in march that I had earned extra from last year. I contacted HR and I was told my salary was lower because they deducted the holiday pay from me as I hadn't earned these days because I'm leaving so early in the year.Not sure on the legalities/what they can deduct from my pay ?? And so significantly?
