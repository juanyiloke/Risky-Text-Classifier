I'm just curious what others did.DS2 is almost 6mo and hates, hates HATES his car seat. I'm talking crying, screaming, coughing, choking, getting hot and sweaty and distressed. He's been like this since newborn except now he doesn't even cry himself to sleep anymore (do I have the only baby in the world who doesn't fall asleep on a long car journey?Ê)Anyway I've no idea what bothers him but I suspect that part of the problem is that he is so curious and nosey and he can't see or hear what's going on really. If you throw in being a bit hungry or tired and probably a bit uncomfortable - he's constantly straining his neck up to look around - then its total meltdown. I often end up in tears by the end of it too and we just avoid the car as much as possible. My family live in France and we're considering cancelling a visit in May as can't bear the thought of the drive.ÊI think that when he faces forward it will get better. Plus I'm hoping that he just grows out of it.....??!!I'm conscious of course that the longer they are rear facing the safer it is, but it's also unsafe for me to be so distracted and stressed by a screaming baby.When's the earliest you put your baby forward facing and what were the reasons?
