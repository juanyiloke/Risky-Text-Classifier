Could it be my faultLet me start from the beginning in 2007 I had about 10 nodules come up in my throat in the lingual tonsil area they biopsied them and removed them with laser they came back benign. In 2009 they grew back bigger and more of them. In Texas that year we had a hurricane and I never got around to going back to my doctor at UTMB Galveston because their hospital was severely damaged from it as well. Now we are in 2014 and by accident a abdominal CT Scan of my abdomen because I have been having pain for some time now picked up a 1.1 cm noncalcified nodule in the lower left lobe of my lung. And yes I am a 1pack a day smoker. Subsequently I had a dedicated Cat Scan of the lungs and it showed (2) 1.1 and 1.0 cm pleural based well defined noncalcified nodules in the lower left lobe of lung I am scheduled with a Pulmonary specialist on 4/21/14 I am just very nervous that if it is malignant It is my fault I have been told I need a CT Guided Needle Biopsy of the lung.
