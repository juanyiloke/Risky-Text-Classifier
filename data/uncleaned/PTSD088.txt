30 Day Recovery ChallengeHello! For the last three days, I have been participating in a Recovery challenge. It consists of 30 questions designed to help individuals in recovery from everything like addictions, to mental disorders like PTSD. So far, I have found it very therapeutic in helping with my own PTSD. So I wanted to share the questions with everyone, and welcome others to participate with me. If you'd like to participate and share your answers, you can post them in this thread. We can discuss our answers with each other if we so choose, and we can offer each other support. Of course, that is optional. Here are the questions- I found them online. This is how it will work: Once a day, please answer the question! If any are too personal or you are not comfortable answering, skip it! You can start or stop the challenge at anytime.
