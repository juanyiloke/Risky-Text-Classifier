Can't decide - immediate implant or prosthesis or delayed reconstruction?¥	Ive only recently been diagnosed with mixed ducal and lobular cancer and am having a mastectomy in a weeks time. I have a few days to make decisions about reconstruction - its hard! I don't yet know whether I will need radiotherapy, but my surgeon seems to be of the mind that it is better to have the implant and deal with any difficulties as they come up. I think my gut says just to go with a prosthesis - less chance of complications and with clothes on, I will look symmetrical. And then if I want to go through more surgery, I can always get the delayed reconstruction at a later time. But, this will never look 'as good' as the immediate implant. So I might always regret the decision not to go with the immediate implant. I have no idea how to go about making this decision. The conclusion seems to be that it is a personal decision and up to the individual, but I just don't know what I want. I don't know how I am going to feel when I wake up without a breast. Help?!
