ÊHow are things getting worse?A while back I posted about attempting to increase calories. Ever since then, my count has gone down. Total opposite of what I was aiming for, but panic got the better of me and I decided it just wasn't worth it. I hate myself for letting it get this way. I'm very underweight now but I can't manage to make myself increase what I'm eating by too much, so I frequently end up around the same place. Like I said- panic gets the better of me.ÊIt's gotten to the point where friends and family are worried about me. My parents keep threatening hospitalization (I'm not sure if that's even a valid threat- can they even do that?). And the sick part is I think I almost want them to follow through with it. I'm so tired of all of this. My body is tired and I can't handle the constant obsession, the continuous counting and exercising and pushing myself. I try to help myself and it backfires. I think that might be my fault because I'm scared of what will happen if I increase my calories and start eating normally again. But I want to so much.ÊI'm going to be seeing a psychiatrist soon and in the mean time I've been prescribed prozac for the anxiety, but I don't know if I can handle an entire month until the appointment. I can't keep doing this to myself. I'm so sick of it. It's getting harder to do things I used to enjoy. It's sucking all the enjoyment out of everything.
