Seven years ago, I watched/helped 3 friends get airlifted to the trauma center after their truck flipped. A fourth friend died. I was also only 16 and just a few months into my fire/EMS training. I was further traumatized by the actions of the school through their idea of intervention/counseling. It took until two years when I was formally diagnosed with PTSD. This experience didn't shy me away from continuing in Fire/EMS and now I'm finally returning to school to pursue a Nursing degree. However, the other day, I was talking to one of my instructors and when she asked what the most traumatic call I've been on, I shared with her what happened in high school. But I also noticed that I had a hard time sharing it with her. Is this normal after so long? I also have started thinking about what actually happened in detail to my friend who died because they never really shared with our group what her injuries were except that she died within 15 minutes of impact. I've been wondering if it'd help my PTSD and peace of mind as to what the extent of the injuries were. But I don't know.
