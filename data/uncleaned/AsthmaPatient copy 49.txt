Hospital admission following attack I have in the past two years been admitted to hospital three times and needed to be ventilated each time for several days the last time it took them over five hours to stabilise me. I have never needed my inhalers over the last 20 years but have now been put on symbicort two puffs twice a day. The medics do not know why I am well in the morning and so ill 3-4 hours later has anyone had or know of anything similar please. I am 46 and a none smoker.
