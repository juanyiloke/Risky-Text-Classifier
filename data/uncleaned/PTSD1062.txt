I know I may get flamed for this but here goes. I am a 24 year old male. I don't cry...at least not normally. I don't know what it is but recently, when I watch a movie (even a comedy) and someone dies, if the mood/tone changes to serious, I cry. Now it's not an all out bawl, but I can feel a tear always escape my eye. I'm crying hard inside though and I can feel it intensely. It is pretty unsettling and I'm sure you canimagine trying to watch movies with your wife and trying hard not to cry when she's not even crying. It's disturbing, and I am wondering if there might be any doctors/psychiatrists/whatever that might be able to help. I'll explain some of my past below. So the only thing that makes any sense to me is repressed pain or whatever. I have lost some close people in my life. I did 6 years in the Army, and while deployed, lost 2 very good friends in combat. I was there when they were put on the bird, and I was there when they were put in the ground, but I never shed a tear and never really felt close. I felt remorse, shame, guilt, and pain...but not tear jerking sadness. I am wondering if my lack of emotion during those hard times has caused some pyscho weird stuff to happen to me now. I know I kind of went stupid in that last sentence but I don't know what is wrong with me. Just looking for any advice. This doesn't seem to happen for much else. Just people dying in movies. People dying in real life, for instance my grandmother, grandfather, and great-grandmother (all after my buddies were killed) did not affect me really. I find that a little odd and somewhat disturbing. I find it is also exponentially worse and harder to control when I am watching a movie alone. I don't think I have PTSD, but yea...I'm not a doc. Thanks in advance for any and all assistance/advice. I do know about Military1Source, so yea. Just to save some time from that resource being thrown out there. Thanks again.
