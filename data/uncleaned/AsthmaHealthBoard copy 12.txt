Can't wean my asthma meds________________________________________I was diagnosed with asthma almost 4 years ago, although I think I've had intermittent symptoms since I was a child. I've been on symbicort 200/6, 2 puffs twice a day, since shortly after being diagnosed and was started on monteleukast about 6 months later for recurrent flare ups. I do have environmental allergies and am on reactine and nasonex for those. I think it took a long time to be diagnosed since I never wheezed and my main symptom was a persistent cough after viral infections. I never saw a doc for the cough, because I figured they wouldn't do anything for it. My cough would be so bad that I would throw up and would keep me up for hours at night and would sometimes last for weeks. When it got really bad my rib and abdominal muscles would be sore from all the coughing. I would be fine between episodes except for some coughing with exercise.I was finally diagnosed after going to my doc after a really bad viral illness where I couldn't shake the cough. Since I had never been on inhalers (other than for a cough several years ago, and at that time the doc I was seeing never mentioned asthma), I assumed that once the cough resolved I would stop them again. This has not been the case and I am a little frustrated. I don't feel like my asthma is nearly as bad as some on this board. I've never needed oral steroids or to go to the ER for management and was fine (mostly) for years before I started treatment. Yet I'm on a good dose of symbicort and still am on monteleukast. I still need ventolin before I exercise. I had had a good winter and had gone 3 months without any significant symptoms and was about to stop the monteleukast when I started to flare last week. It's not terrible, but also not getting better. I'm a little tight, needing ventolin occasionally and have woken a couple of times at night with cough. I do have an action plan to manage this. It doesn't feel like I should need as much medication as I'm taking, given that I don't seem to have the severe symptoms some have. When I've had PFTs they've been normal (no symptoms at those times and on symbicort). My doc says that even though PFTs are normal, I respond to the meds I'm on and this definitely is asthma. How is it that I went years without being on anything and now seem to have flare ups regularly despite being treated and can't get off my meds? Are there others out there who feel like they are on more medications than they think they should be on given their symptoms?
