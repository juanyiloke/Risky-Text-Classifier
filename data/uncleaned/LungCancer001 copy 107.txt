Lump/knot right under left breast, near middle chest. MaleSaturday, i woke up to some upper chest pain. I smoke bidis/cigarettes and i think i had this before, but not for long. I think the lump been there for a while too, just not painful untill saturday. When i felt the pain saturday, I just brushed it off untill i felt a lump just right under my left breast, next to sterum. It had pain with it and i was scared beyond belief. I smoke alot and it scared me that i might have lung cancer. Im only 22 yo. I woke up sunday and the pain went away alot but still some there. I started getting this little cough and some minor pain in lower stomach. Anybody experienced anything similar? Im going to the doctor later on today but this has me scared to deathReplyMulti-Quote
