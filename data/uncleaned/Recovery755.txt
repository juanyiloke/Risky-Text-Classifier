What often Works for MeYoga has been a great help with depression  and anxiety creating islands of peace when surrounded by  impenetrable  sludge or a raging torrent. Sometimes I can feel the positive effects for up to a week after a class and last month it pulled me out of a very bad state where I was becoming  frightened at how bad I was feeling.I am still feeling the reassuring effect 4 weeks on,so very impressed!  I don't use medication , not sure if this is the wisest thing but the combination of gentle exercise and yoga is allowing me more time feeling secure and grounded than in the past . Apart from feeling good after a class ( peaceful and optimistic usually ) I think it continues to work   by clearing the air waves , removing negative filters( e.g. the harsh inner critic)  long enough  to allow a backlog of positive thoughts to emerge( bit like turning on your mobile and having the queued arrive). I have managed to discover many things I actually like about myself through this process of respite and the memory of this  can be very reassuring when the savage times hit .My problems with depression are enormous , I don't rely solely on yoga and exercise, but obviouisly from my spruiking , I recommend giving it a go if you're considering it.The one I do is a very gentle (non athletic) form that aims towards inner peace and healing.Cheers
