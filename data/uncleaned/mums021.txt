DS is 6, nearly 7. He usually sees name calling etc as part of school life - but today he's complained boy X has been punching him in the shoulder and when he's told him he didn't like it, the boy called him a weako. I asked if he'd told a teacher and he said the playground assistant just laughed it off saying it was a joke. I know these things happen but surely if a child doesn't like another child doing something to him, especially when punching is involved, surely the classroom assistant should at least take it seriously? I've told him we'll see how it goes - but at what stage do you complain?
