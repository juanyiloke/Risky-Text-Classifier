The Miracle of Baking SodaSo this might be common knowledge to many here but its been a revelation to me. The best to way to clean yourself is to use baking soda. A couple of dabs under your armpits, between your toes, and your body odour is gone. I've stopped using soap, body wash and deodorant. They're just rip off products that damage your skin and poison your body.I've also stopped using shampoo and my hair has become softer and thicker.
