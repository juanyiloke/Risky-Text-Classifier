violent spouse with PTSDby omalley_cat » Wed Dec 31, 2014 4:08 pmI really need some advice, or really just someone to talk to who can really understand this disorder.my partner has PTSD, and sometimes when we argue he just flips. he says he feels threatened when i shout at him and that sends him into a rage attack. Last night he strangled me. I have bruises all over my neck and he held me, unable to breathe, for such a long time i literally thought he was going to kill me. I thought I was dying. I'm now in a really difficult situation. i don't want to be an abused partner, but at the same time I LOVE my boyfriend so much. I adore him. and aside from this we have a really great relationship. I know that it's his trauma and his disorder that makes him act like this - he isn't a controlling or aggressive person in day to day life, and he has none of the other symptoms of a domestic abuser. But I'm scared he wont get better, and maybe one day he's just going to kill me...he's in therapy to treat his disorder and he did seem to be making process until last night.what do i do? am i being niave? I want to stick by him and help him through this but i've really just realised how dangerous this disorder can be in certain people.any and all comments welcomed. thanks.
