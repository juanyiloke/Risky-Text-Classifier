The C Word¥	Evening all,well ive just sat with my partner and watched this drama,  omg!!! I cried all the way through it,sheridan smith is a truly fabulous actress she actually met the lady lisa she portrayed before she passed after this rotten sh. t of a disease got the better of her.¥	I could relate to how lisa felt at times during her treatment ,that it had ruined a lot of good things in her life ,her looks ,personality,her willpower and the fact at times she felt she didnt want to wake up most mornings.its true what i hear a lot of people say that have been and are living with this illness ,you dont know whats its like unless youve lived it.when people say chin up !! At times i just wanted to break theirs.¥	Good luck to all that are going through treatment and good luck to those that have been lucky to have got through.¥	Tracyx
