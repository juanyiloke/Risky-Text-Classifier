Ionisers for Asthma.Posted 3 months agoMy wife was taken into hospital  a couple of days ago and is the second time within 6 weeks. She has Asthma and uses the tubes  Brown blue and purple. She has suffered for a long time with this but it is only the last two years that the problem has got worse.Her GP told her therewas a lack of oxygen in her blood and also X Rays were taken which diagnosed Pnumonia in her right lung.  whilst in hospital she was given Steroids and Anti Biotics. She also was constantly on oxygen until the levels reached a figure where they were able to allow her home.She visited her GP again about her breathing and was sent to Hospital where again they have kept her in. This time they are doing blood tests and asked he if she lives in a dusty enviroment.2 years ago our Son And Daughter who are Twins brought home a Lion Head Rabbit and this is now a house Rabbit. It does have very fine longish fur and is always trying to snuggle up to my wife. Could this be the source of the problem? I have also been told to buy an ioniser? would this help with Asthma?Kind regards Dennis
