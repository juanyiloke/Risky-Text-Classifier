ÊBody Dysmorphic Disorder?So I was under the impression that BDD was only excessive work-out... but looking at the criteria I'm pretty sure I have it. Is there a place here to discuss BDD? Maybe this is the forum? Would really like some input because it's getting worse. I think about my defects all the time. It affects how I sit, how I walk, the clothes I wear, don't want anyone to take my picture, afraid of people seeing my profile or touching my side... actually don't want anyone to touch me at all. Working out was a huge problem for me because my defects made me so depressed.. so I stopped and have been really underweight for a long time... I think I didn't want to gain weight because I was trying to hide my defects. I feel like I look freakishly but people say they don't notice it... I see it though and I hate my body. I think it looks disgusting. What do I do? I don't want to talk about it to my T but maybe I have to... It's really causing me a lot of distress. I am going to start a rigorous eating and work-out program when I get home and part of me don't want to stop thinking about the defects because how can I correct them if I stop thinking about them? I see perfect bodies everywhere, it's affecting me more and more. I don't want anyone to see my body the way it is now. Right now I just want to find some sort of surgery that can fix this... but they would have to be extensive.Anyway... just don't know what to do and would like to hear from other people who have / have had similar issues.
