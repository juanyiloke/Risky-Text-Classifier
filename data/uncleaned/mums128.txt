Hi. Please could you share your thoughts/experiences of young children going to see a family member's body and attending the funeral? Dds are 5 & 7. They were very close to their grandad who we nursed at home to the end on Sunday (died of pancreatic cancer so it's all happened a bit quick but have kept them informed throughout). I'm just not sure whether to take them to see him. I'd like them to have a better visual memory of him than what they saw when he died. Would welcome your thoughts. Thanks
