I feel uncomfortable missing lecturesby EllieC130So I've basically missed the last 5 in one module; 2 because I overslept like an idiot, 2 because I genuinely didn't think they'd be any use and 1 this morning because I didn't think they'd let me in because I was running REALLY late. Aside from that I've only missed 1 or 2 but it's really starting to bother me. Luckily they don't mark attendance but all the same, I feel like crap for doing it. I know it's wasting my money but the only reason I feel this bad is because this morning's is on half of my essay topic. However it's a topic I looked at in my seminar last week and already have a lot of references on. Should I really feel this bad? I'm resolving to attend all of next years especially since that's second year.
