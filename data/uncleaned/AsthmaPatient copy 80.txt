Newly diagnosed asthma I am a nurse and my doctor thinks I might have asthma as my only symptoms are chest tightness and non-productive cough - have had an infection recently which was treated with antibiotics and also this is my second chest infection since October when I was in hospital for 4 days with pneumonia: it took me a month to recover from that with severe shortness of breath on exertion (SOBOE). My Company has a no work-no pay sickness policy and I am terrified of being off work for a long spell with the resultant financial problems so am anxious to get a diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. [u:f543248ade]What I am saying is that it is scary to have a new diagnosis and the effects it may have on your life[/u:f543248ade].It is good to find out as much about the condition as possible so you can talk to your doctor and asthma nurse how to best manage the condition and prevent adverse affects on your health and lifestyle; I have started using Asthma UK and found the nurse advisor on their helpline very supportive and informative. I was confused as to why the doctor had just asked me to keep a peak flow diary am and pm for two weeks and then see the asthma clinic nurse without offering me anything to relieve my symptoms and discomfort (peak flow circa 300); the Asthma UK nurse advised me to make appointment with the clinic nurse sooner to express my concerns and get some input.Talking to people - both health professionals and fellow sufferers is the way forward in helping you feel a sense of regaining control. It is true that you can have a physically active life once the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is stable. Stay well and may speak again.
