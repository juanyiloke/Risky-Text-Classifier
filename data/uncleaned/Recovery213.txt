  Post 2 - The past has made me a better human being.________________________________________When my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, decided to go back for a month to sort out his health care and prepare for the end. I paid a friend to go to school to be his health care aide. In exchange he could live in the house free, and take care of my father; as he wanted to die at home. The first day taking my father to radiation, I had a panic attack. This brought my depression & anxiety to close to the breaking point. I stayed in my old family home. I hated being there. The longer I stayed the more unwell I became. Bad feelings started to surface, but I was confused - my father was dying & I had to help him. Chemotherapy started. His doctor told me the cancer was terminal. Then surgery. My father had no health insurance. It was until closer to the end, it was discovered he qualified for Veterans' health insurance as he had fought in WWII. After surgery he had to convalesce in a nursing home for a month. With support in place I ready return home. My only surviving sibling confided in me that some disturbing items were found in my father's workshop. My father was a pedophile!     I was devastated! He was recuperating in the nursing home. I went to see him & hoped he would die. I told him to pray to God for his sins. Before leaving to return home, I had to arrange for a coffin & the burial service as the doctors' had told me he did not have long to live. I returned home & had a breakdown. I thought I wanted to be hospitalized. It went as far as meeting my psychiatrist in Emergency. He wanted to emit me. My husband wasn't sure this was what I needed. I listened to my husband. I was banned from seeing this psychiatrist and his partners for life. To be continued in Post 3...
