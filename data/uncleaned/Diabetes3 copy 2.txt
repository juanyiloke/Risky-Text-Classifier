Low calorie diet/weight loss trialHi there, I wondered if I could let you know about a type 2 diabetes study that has recently started at Imperial College London. It's assessing whether a low calorie diet produces better weight loss and reduces or eliminates the need for insulin compared to routine care alone. If you have type 2 diabetes and have been taking insulin for 10 years or less, and would like more information on the study please call 07989 599549 or email weightloss@imperial.ac.uk. Many thanks, Kate
