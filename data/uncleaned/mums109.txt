DD is 13 w today and I am trying to think of new, creative stuff to do with her as she starts to take notice of what's around her a bit more.Sometimes I carry her out to the garden and show her plants and the sky.Sometimes I show her shiny surfaces in the house.We do stories, playmat, tummy time. Today I tried getting her to grasp all the door handles downstairs.But it's a bit difficult when she doesn't sit up yet or grab things on her own. Any ideas for stimulating her?
