Advice re surgery for my nieceMy niece who is her mid forties and has two boys aged 8 and 6 has been told that she needs to have a hysterectomy as she has fibroids which are causing her problems.Ê As I am a bit out of touch can anyone advise on how long she will be in hospital and what sort of help she will need afterwards? Her husband has private health insurance so she will be in a private hospital, if that makes a difference.Ê The operation is to be in late March.
