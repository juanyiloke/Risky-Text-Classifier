Black And White ThinkingWhen I hit on a touchy subject, one that I haven't work through entirely, I find myself (no, actually, it is pointed out to me by the generous posters on this board) that it is black/white thinking. I used to do it more (it used to set the frame for my life (she's bad, he's good - I must die/I must be happy - I am good/I am horrible etc etc), but as I heal I find that there is much more 'greyness' in my thought patterns. Except when there isn't. I don't usually catch it, you guys do. When it is pointed out to me, I know I have some serious work to do.ÊI feel like my black/white stuff is about feeling trapped. I can't see any other answer somehow unless it is pointed out to me ... then I go 'Duhhhhh! Why didn't I see that!' It feels like it is a cognitive thing. Like, if various options are presented to me then I am open to them and can sort them out or at least expand into something besides black/white.ÊHave any of you worked on B/W? If so, what strategies did you use? Do you generally need someone to point out the error of your thinking patterns? Any other thoughts?
