low weight & low ironHi Everyone,So over the past 2 months I have had zero energy and so tired, that I struggle to even stay awake.I am recovering from anorexia, so I have been so confused when I have been eating well and yet my tiredness and lack of energy has got worse rather than better.Anyway, I also struggle with hypoglycemia and this has been worse over the past couple of months aswell.Well I had my bloods checked and got the results today, which shows I am slightly low in Iron.My questions are -ÊWould having a slight Iron deficiency cause so much tiredness & lack of energy?Would it make my hypoglycemia worse?How long after starting Iron supplements should I start feeling the benefits?Due to my low weight, would the effects of low iron be more so than if I was a healthy weight?Thanks for any replies
