Sick and worriedI have been under the weather for the past 3 days. I haven't been able to work out or really do anything. It's not a stomach bug which means I am eating like normal. I have a strict workout routine for the week and I don't feel comfortable with straying from what I usually do. But this week I have to workout much less than I usually do and I am panicking inside. I'm worried about weight gain and feeling very critical about my body if i don't workout even though my logical brain knows nothing will really happen and I should rest. Any encouragement or words of advice?
