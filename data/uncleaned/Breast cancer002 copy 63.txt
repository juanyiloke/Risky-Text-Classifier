It's happening- hair loss¥	Hi beautiful ladies!¥	Just an update, my mum is 12 days post her first ever chemo. She is on the T from the FEC part first.¥	Today she said her hair is falling out in chunks. So I guess we need to get the clippers out. One problem... She's allergic to the metal in the clippers lol she gets a horrible rash! And she already has one on her kneck! ¥	It has to be done but I know this will be a tough experience and I have a feeling we all might cry a little! ¥	How did you all find the hair part? How hard or maybe even easy was it for you?
