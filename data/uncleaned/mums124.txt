For the past 2 months I have been thinking daily about having a 3rd child. I already have 2 children (4 & 2), and I'm 30 years old. My heart says YES, I want many many babies! I loved the newborn stage and breastfeeding etc.. but my brain says NO because we would need the bigger house, bigger car, no more family holidays, etc etc. My husband and I would never get any time together, forget finding a babysitter for 3, etc... Ugh I dither back and forth every day between yes and no, and its tormenting me, affecting my work etc. I guess I don't even have a question, just wondering if anyone else is going through this phase!
