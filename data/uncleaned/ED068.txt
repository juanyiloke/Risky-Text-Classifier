Lowest pointThe situation I am in right now makes me feel awful. I was at a healthy weight for a while after being severely underweight but now I am bigger than I have ever been. I am still in "normal range" but I am so disgusted with myself. I absolutely hate my body and I struggle with it every single day. I eat healthy and go to the gym but I am not seeing any changes. I am hopeless at this point and I feel like I am never going to get to a point where I am comfortable with my body. I need help from people who have gone through what I am going through. I don't mean to be dramatic or tell a sob story but at this point I'm probably not even going to go to my senior prom because I feel like I am going to be spending hundreds of dollars to ""look pretty" and still feel like an ugly troll.
