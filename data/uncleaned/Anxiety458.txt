Feels like i am HelplessHello,To be true i am in a very critical situation. Don't know if it is the right section or right site for asking this kind of help but please if you relate or have any suggestions, help me.I am a college student, Senior year. i have this friend, we've known each other from starting days of the college. Almost 2 years i guess. We have always shared our problems and happiness together. But, what happened yesterday was beyond my control. She didn't come to college. i called her(we live in different cities) and she was crying. I tried all i can to make her talk and she finally said, her father beat her a day ago. and more i tried to make her talk, i came to know that this is not the first time her father has done something like this. I didn't even have a word to soothe her at time.I tried my best to divert her mind, make her laugh, anything. But i am being honest, deep down what she told me, her father did, i couldn't even imagine what she's been through. i am worried about her. i couldn't sleep whole night thinking about what she had gone through and that she is alone in that hell house. I myself cried just thinking about it.i thought about it all the night, all the solutions to this. i am not in position that i can confront her family since i am still an outsider to her parents. I can't even go to the police since she refuses to do so. I really care for her, for all these years we've been through, i can't let her live like this.If anyone has any, any solution or anything; can you please tell me? i am really looking for all the help i can get.
