Nodule in LungI have solitary 8mm nodule on the upper part of my right lung. My doctor has recommended a follow up scan in three months to see if it has grown. I am a non-smoker. I did have DCIS breast cancer 17 years ago with bilateral mastectomies. All of my check-ups have been fine. I had a chest x-ray in June of this year, but it was clean. Could the nodule have appeared after that, or was it not picked up on the x-ray? I would think a nodule of that size could be seen on an x-ray. Is this the right course of treatment for now? I am so worried.
