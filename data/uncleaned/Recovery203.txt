  How I Got Out of Depression________________________________________For me, it was all in the mind, and I believe that it's the same for most people.It's like being inside a dark hole where you see no light, no escape, no way out. You feel no sense of purpose, no drive to do anything. Sometimes you can even see how it affects your loved ones but still, can't seem to be able to change it. You just want to curl up in a ball and feel as you don't exist. You even feel like you want to sleep and never wake up. That's where I was and I am thankful and grateful I was able to overcome it. One of the first realizations was that I let circumstances outside of me take over and run my life. Until I started looking for answers I started to find the light, and many things led me to understanding myself better, and understanding my own mind.The mind is such a powerful tool we tend to under-appreciate. The mind affects your body directly, and it has the power to destroy but also create and reflect your reality in the outside. I did not know this. But once I gained a better awareness of this simple concept I immediately understood one thing: That we can take gain control of it.Being in a hole was perhaps one of the worst and best things that happened to me. Yes, there is even beauty in adversity once you start to learn to see it. Everything started to change when I started to change my thoughts. I learned to force myself to get out of an environment that only promoted negativity, I learned to read, watch, and listen to inspiring material, I learned to harness the power of positive thinking in my favor, but perhaps most importantly is that I kept doing it in an ongoing basis until the depression started to fade and be gone completely.I learned that YOU are your best solution as you already posses the tools to do so. You just need to realize it.People and outside circumstances can influence, but it is ultimately up to you to make the final decision and take action on how you chose to feel.Realize that you are not just a piece of meat running around, you are more than that, you are more of an energy being capable of changing your energy through your mind and your thoughts, capable of creating the feelings that promote your growth and the essense of your existence.Begin by changing your thoughts, and you will change your life.-Val G
