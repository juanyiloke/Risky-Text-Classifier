My BlogI just started a blog on how I'm coping with mental health problems. I also uploaded some scribbles I recently did to the blog. check it out if you're interested: please pm me for link.I really hope that writing down my thoughts and getting them out there will help me to understand myself better and serve as a constructive outlet. the things i've "drawn" so far are actually just lines on paper, nothing concrete, but I've been trying to get my creative energies flowing again... cheers for reading!
