Hi everyone. I have had Adult Onset Asthma for 15 years but have had little trouble with it for the last 10. I take Singulair, Zyrtec, Advair, and good old Albuterol. I had been fine until about 2 1/2 months ago I caught a cold which turned into bronchitis then pneumonia, then the asthma flaired and I ended up in the hospital on Solumedrol and oxygen. Did a 30 day prednisonetaper then 3 days after that was done I caught the flu (yes I did get my flu shot) and ended up in the ER and back on prednisone for another week....... the very day that taper was over I walked across a parking lot in the cold snowy air and flaired yet again..... back in the hospital for another 4 days on solumedrol and sent home on prednisone yet again. Yes, I am a smoker. Or I was, I am now a full month without cigarettes. To complicate matters I am Bipolar and prednisone makes me manic so we had to quadruple my Bipolar meds which also causes weight gain. So 2 weight gainer meds AND I quit smoking and I am putting on the pounds. It is my intention to start Nutra System next week, I can not afford to gain anymore weight. Just this morning I went in for pulmonary function testing and was told that I also have moderate COPD.... I have been on Daily Strength for years for Bipolar support but I figured it was time to get some support for my lungs too. Nice to meet you all. Audrey
