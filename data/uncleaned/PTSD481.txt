Êpsychotic like experiencesI wasn't sure where to post this, but it doesn't feel safe to post right now on the forum I usually use.I told my therapist that I needed to quit therapy as I'm going downhill in all areas of my life. He said he's willing to try again and hoped I was too.This was 2 weeks ago. Ever since, I have these intrusive sensations of being stabbed in the chest over and over. It happens randomly, I could be in a work meeting or driving down the street.Its psychotic like, but not psychotic. I cant explain to emotions associated with this. The only way I can describe it right now is that it feels like I'm Being murdered. I know how ridiculous this must seem, but i dont know what this is and I'm scared. I'm also feeling depersonalized and anxious and have sui thoughts on and off.ÊIt feels almost persecutory and torturous. What is this? Please help
