4 days post laparoscopic prostatectomy I was diagnosied in march this year with prostate cancer, I am not all that up to speed with all of the technical terms but my gleeson was 3+4 = 7 and two out of 10 biopsy cores were positive. I went for both bone and MRI scans, these indicated no spread outside the prostate. I then had various options ranging from active surveillance through to full surgery. In my case and despite my absolute morbid fear of hospitals, it was a no brainer I chose surgery.So we came to the "big day" last Tuesday, my operation was done by Professor (edited by Moderator) at Edinburgh's Western General. The entire team were absolutely wonderful and despite my terror I came through in one piece, although obviously a small part of me was gone. My tummy area was fairly tender and the catheter is a minor inconvenience, but all in all I am good. I was able to go home on the Thursday complete with my supply of painkillers and bags. And a bit proud of myself that I coped reasonably well. I have my cystogram and TWOC next week and fairly soon after that should get the pathology results.I have been pretty active, walk in the morning and evening and rest in between. I realise that this is very personal to the individual concerned but I can't stress enough how terrified I was before and how relieved I am now. In my opinion I have given myself the best possible chance of staying cancer free (touch wood)
