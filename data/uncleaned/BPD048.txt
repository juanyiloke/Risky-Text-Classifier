Does anyone else do this (Text messaging related)?by Mileenabug » Mon Jun 01, 2015 10:59 pmWhen I text someone and I get a satisfying response I don't always respond back. It's like I got the sense they liked me and that alone-a simple "That's cool!" or something-will fill me with so much joy that I have a little party in my head. Makes me feel better. Its an overreaction I know. It makes me fee loved. But then I feel really guilty later that I didn't say anything back... So I give a lame reply.... sometimes... other times I just never respond.Is anyone else like this???
