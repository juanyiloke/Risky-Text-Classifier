Appalling behaviour!The wanton destruction by Isis of historical sites in Irac (how on earth do you spell it?) is wicked and mindless. Do we really want to dilute our culture by importing other cultures.  European and we have a chance,  but Middle Eastern culture we don't understand and neither do they. Put it this way forumites I am too old too understand anymore.  The local news also informs me that the schools here are learning Mandarin. Knowledge is to be sought but for the first time I feel swamped by these changes.  All of a sudden the world is too big. Perhaps I will hang up my boots and live in my own little world till the bell rings
