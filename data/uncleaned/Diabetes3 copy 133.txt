The perversity of diabetesWhy oh why does my control have to go out of the window when I really need it to behave? The diabetes fairy really was alive and well today.I'm having trouble with the bit of central vision I've got left and it's super precious to me. I had an appointment at the eye hospital as my vision is very flickery and hazy and we are keeping a watch on the development of my cataract.I left the house on 5.6, then my bg just rose up and up until it levelled off at 16.5. I don't eat breakfast so no food to blame, I started correcting and correcting. Nothing made any difference, 8 units of correction which is about twice my daily bolus and 5 hours later still on 15.6. Aargghhh. I hate having poor control when I'm seeing a consultant about saving my sight or anything diabetes related, I worry that they think I'm not bothering. I felt like a fraud saying what good, stable control I've got whilst my pump is merrily alarming every 5 minutes warning me how high my blood sugar is- even though it is a rare occurrence. It was also a day when I forgot to carry a spare pump cannula or an emergency pen.Thank you diabetes for being so completely awkward. Just needed to rant about the perversity of it all  __________________Type 1 since 1978, Medtronic Veo pump and CGM.
