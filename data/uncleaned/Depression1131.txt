Struggling to remember the good stuffHi,I've suffered from both generalised anxiety and depression for a number of years.Ê At present I feel I'm slipping into depression again, feeling disconnected and sad.Ê One of my on going challenges is to remember the good stuff.Ê When I think back in time, it's the negative experiences that I remember most, and I find myself beating myself up over stuff that happened long ago. Anyone else out there experiencing something similar?Ê What do you find helpful? I've read about mindfulness but I find it quite difficult to put into practice.
