Becoming diabetic,,,"  17  Hi there, anyone out there who can offer advice? I received this evening a letter from my GP following some blood test results. Of course receiving it on a Friday evening means I have no one to discuss my anxieties with until Monday - nothing like ruining your weekend! First of all. I have never experienced any symptoms of diabetes and was only ever tested for it in pregnancy with my son 9 years ago - all normal then. However, I have had gynaecological problems in the last 3 years. This resulted in me having a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy last November. I had a massive fibroid removed as well as uterus and cervix. It was a complicated op that took nearly six hours and involved a blood transfusion. Post op I was on iron tablets (not surprising considering my blood loss) but about 5 weeks on suffered terribly with fatigue. GP decided to blanket test for everything - thyroid, iron and glucose. As a result I was recalled to do a fasting glucose test. This came back slightly above normal so I was asked to retest. My gynaecologist, however, told me to wait a while as he suspected my blood had not fully stabilised. So beginning of April I retested and did Cholesterol at the same time. My my letter today says my results "show that you are becoming diabetic". This was a shock as I was expecting everything to have settled since January (my last test). What does this mean. Is it 'prediabetes' or is it saying I an so close to it I can't prevent it?i was on 'prostap' hormonal injections for 5 months for my fibroid. The aim was to reduce it pre-op - in the end the drug didn't touch it - too big. I have read that this drug in fact increases your risk if diabetes. Has anyone else had it before getting diabetes? Upsetting to think I took it for nothing and now it my have made me diabetic!! I can't be sure it's that of course but I no longer have fatigue, never had thirst or need for frequent urination. Any help any advice? I would be so grateful.
