NHS - Couch to 5KI saw this mentioned on another thread and I thought I'd just mention something to bare in mind if you enjoy running on pavement. Please do look out for your knees, especially if you are carrying an extra pound or two. What the heck, let's be honest, and extra stone or two. Running is a fantastic exercise, but so is walking. I suppose decent foot wear will make a difference, you obviously need something to take the shock out of landing on a very hard surface repeatedly. People with diagnosed diabetes are nearly twice as likely to have arthritis, indicating a diabetes-arthritis connection. That's something that I haven't fully researched, but there seems to be a connection.
