Specialist vrs General MD________________________________________I'm new to this and I haven't found an answer to my first question on the boards. I've been reading the book "Beating Asthma". It stresses going to an Asthma Specialist. (but that could just be because the author is one) Our general family doctor prescribed an inhaler (Advair). But that's about it and I see him once a year.I some times have coughing but he hasn't paid any real attention to that. I'm considering going to a specialist and wondering what advantages there are, if any, to doing that? Thank You
