Upset about Jewish roots and unsure of how to talkStarted by Renetee?, 07-02-15 02:05 PM A year ago I discovered my 'English' family has Jewish roots and since then, I've felt uncomfortable and upset. I always thought I looked funny for a wholly European person, so I went to research for myself and that is where I discovered it.Whenever I try to talk about my reasons for such hatred I'm just branded a troll or anti-Semite or my post gets removed which does not help me at all.I read that I had relatives in Germany who were exterminated in the holocaust and I wish that they killed all my family so I wasn't born. I just wish I never learned about it.
