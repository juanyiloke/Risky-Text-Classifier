  Drunk but came across a fine ideaPurpose is necessary to function in society. Power relies on one's own perception of purpose. Purpose is temporary but can have differentiating spans of time. IN any situation, if youfind  yourself uncomfortable , pensive, or angry, try assigning yourself a purpose. That purpose could be accepting a role, feeling calm, acting happy, having a sense of humor, anything. A purpose can at least trick the mind into enabling your body to react accordingly to situations that may require a bit of nerve.No matter what situation, if you find yourself timid, you decide to place your purpose in fulfilling the role of the timid one. What if you could choose to become the one who applies his or her knowledge to other people when they are around? That situation becomes then not just a "social  interaction," but a purpose one is effectively handling because it fits as a current objective. Purpose isn't supposed to be mechanical, purpose can be reactive. Purpose can be applied to any situation, you can find yourself in an unpleasant  situation and apply a purpose to yourself to be the patient, accepting role... At least until that situation comes to an end! Then one effectively handles a situation and has the ability to adapt to anything that arises. What is more powerful  than rapid adaptability? Thank you.
