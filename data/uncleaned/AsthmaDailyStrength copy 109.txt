Hi everyone, I am new here and very happy to have found a forum where I can talk to other people who might be able to understand or help! My son, 8 years old, was diagnosed with asthma at 18 months old, after several emvergency room visits. Up until about 5 years old, he was in the hospital at least every 3-4 months. Now, although he isnt controlled any better, we manage to keep his attacks controlled with his puffer (salbutamal). He has been on 1000mcg of flovent inhaled steroid for the last month as we increased his dosage due to uncontrolled level of asthma. (usual dosage is 500 mcg per day) 24 hour antihistamine given each morning. Benadryl 3-4 times a week at night on top of his 24 hour antihistamine ventalin used as needed. Last week (monday) doc put him on 3 big doses of prednisone to get him back to health as he was not getting any better (using his puffer 6-10 times throughout the day as well as 1-4 times throughout the night).... obviously out of control right now. He is much better after the prednisone but we are still giving him the same as I described above. He needed his puffer once during soccer today so he is doing well compared to a week ago. My concerns: -is 1000mgm flovent a huge dose for a child? -he was beyond moody on the prednisone. He was really really difficult to manage (mood swings, irritabiltiy, raging). -now, and like always when he is only on flovent, he is just plain grumpy. He is always grouchy and edgy. He has been like this on every drug he has taken for asthma but he seems extra grouchy lately. -also, he has been getting really bad headaches. I am thinking maybe even migraines (going to pediatrician as soon as they can get me in). -are these side effects that are normal? Acceptable? I just feel like pulling him off of all drugs and seeing how he is but I know that I cannot do that to him as he would be down and sick within a few days. Sorry for the long winded introduction!
