ÊWhat to expect in the first stages of recovery?Hello,I have been struggling with anorexia for the past 8 months or so. I am beginning to get treatment and have a pretty good treatment team with a doctor, dietitian, and counselor. However, I have not yet been able to increase my daily intake enough to maintain my weight... My BMI is very low and they have been threatening hospitalization for the past couple weeks now... I am eating more than in the past, but my caloric increase has been at an extremely slow rate.ÊI don't want to lose anymore weight and am becoming more serious/determined to up my calories. I am so nervous though. I know when people up their intake they will often hold water weight for a while.If I up my intake a bit this week should I expect to hold a lot of water? If I keep eating this amount consistently throughout the week, will the water eventually come off? Should I expect to have water weight gain with every calorie increase?Can anyone share their experience with slowly increasing calorie intake... what did your weight do?(Ps, I know * calories is still not enough. My ultimate goal is, of course, to get to a high enough intake to gain weight, but I need to take it slow. I am not quite comfortable with the idea of gaining yet, and prefer to just stabilize my weight first. Eventually I will increase to an amount that is above the minimum daily requirement)
