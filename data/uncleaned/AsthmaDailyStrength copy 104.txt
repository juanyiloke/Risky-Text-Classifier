After about 6 years of not having was used to be mild asthma, the symptoms have come back but stronger. I have never really had an "asthma attack". My PFT, chest x-rays,oxygen levels, and peak flow meters have always come back normal. Only one doctor has heard a mild wheezing once. Although my pulmonologist says it is possible that I do have asthma, I am not sure if either he or I are entirely convinced. As I sit her typing this I am short of breath and have a tight chest. I know I have to back on my Dulera ASAP but I wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences of having perfect test results yet still have trouble breathing.
