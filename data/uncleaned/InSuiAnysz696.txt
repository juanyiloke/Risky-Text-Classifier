I've never done this before, actually shared my thoughts on suicide. but I came across this site in search of painless suicidal methods. Thing is usually Im a strong person. but i feel as though lately perhaps ive been shrugging things off for too long. like im about to reach my breaking point. im not looking for sympathy, but perhaps a better understanding of why i feel this way and if im being weak in doing so. could suicide be the right choice? im just a kid, im tired of having to be strong for myself because no one else would give a ****. and when the people you thought were closest to you end up being first to judge you and toss you aside, who do you turn to then? wtf is so difficult about trying to understand someone's reasoning to the way they've become, before judging them harshly? and the people i live with, i refuse to call a family. im tired of being forgotten. im tired of being the punching bag. im tired of being made to feel like i dont matter, like if i disappeared today it would make no difference. im tired of being made out to be some ***** when really i just cant stand feeling this out of place and having to take everyone's bs from all angles. i refuse to put up with it any longer
