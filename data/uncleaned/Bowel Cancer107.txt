Diet advice after APRHi everyone,I am fairly new to this forum and need some help knowing what to eat. I am 2 months post op after an APR for rectal cancer with a permanent colostomy and I have also started weekly chemo but finding I have had a couple of colic pain attacks ( which seem to occur at night) with vomiting being the only relief from the pain. I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem and is it normal and can I fix it with diet, I am careful that I dont eat anything that can cause a blockage but sometimes get scared to eat anything. I was ok when I first came home from hospital and this has only started happening since chemo started so was wondering if it is chemo related?.Any advice at all would be much appreciated.
