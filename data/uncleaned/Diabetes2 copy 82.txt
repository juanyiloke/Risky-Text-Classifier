Simple Question regarding disposal of syringes   Hi Everyone,I have been prescribed injectable vitamins, by my GP, and have been provided with a sharps bin (yellow with orange lid).I just realized that on the front, it say "sharps, excluding those contaminated with medicinal products and their residues". It also says next to this in bold letters, "Contaminated sharps only". Aren't these statements contradicting each other? I inject B12 and Magnesium Sulphate. Doesn't this mean that the sharps are contaminated with a "medicinal product" (e.g. methlycobalamin) so I shouldn't use this container?Please could some Kind person clarify what is meant by "medicinal products and their residues".Many Thanks
