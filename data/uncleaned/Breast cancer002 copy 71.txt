letrozole side effects¥	Hello to all, can anyone help with this?  ¥	Don't know whether it's the letrozole or alendronic which is causing itching, it just started about 2-3 weeks ago and I came off the alendronic 2 weeks ago on my Dr's advice as it can be a side effect of the medication.  Still got the itch, mostly on my back but on my torso sometimes too.  Got my repeat prescription for letrozole which I have been taking for about 4 months and despite asking for Cipla they gave me another brand, Teva which I have been taking for about 3 weeks.  I'm a bit sceptical as to the coating on the letrozole contributing to this but surely the side effects would have subsided from the alendronic by now?  Any help greatly appreciated
