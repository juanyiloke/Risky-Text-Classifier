Some good news to shareYesterday I had the first colonoscopy since the nasty stuff was chopped out last July. Had a couple of tiny polyps removed from the wound site which my surgeon said was probably just inflammation. No sign of cancer anywhere!!!I have just had my final dose of chemotherapy so look forward to skin improving.I am being made redundant Yay!!!!! It will be fab to have some time out without cancer/chemoLooking forward to Saturday and putting faces to names. I really do appreciate all the hugs and love from my on line friendsDawn
