Battling reality & my fantasy lifeI've had a very active fantasy life since I was a young teenager. I have created a very comfortable & controlled environment. I've noticed very recently that I have this hole in my life that I'd like to have filled in reality but I measure most relationships against the main characters in my fantasy. So now realising I'm lonely. But why?I have friends & people who care about me. I have this expectation of this dream girl. But I know she is not real. It has stopped me from being satisfied with my friends in reality. I'm.hoping this is making some kind of sense.Anyone else know what I'm talking about?
