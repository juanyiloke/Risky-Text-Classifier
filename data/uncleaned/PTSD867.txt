Êtoday (march 1st)I have been relatively OK for a while but last night I had an enormous panic attack, with many flashbacks of being electrically shocked. I feel these pains shoot right through me, as if I am still in the mental hospital of 1972.ÊI keep hoping that I have seen the last of my past but it keeps coming back to haunt me.ÊI have an awful feeling that there are more hidden memories of things that were done to me at that time that have still to appear. I thought it was all gone. I hope it has all gone.
