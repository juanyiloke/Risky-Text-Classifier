Classy/ Stag.Hey Guys I'm organising a stag in Cork for my buddy who's a graphic designer. He's not sporty in the least, a bit of a proud nerd/hipster in fact, and I'd would love some brainstorming help and ideas here to avoid the usual cliché ideas. That being said he expressed that he is perfectly happy with pints and Go-karting (not in that order). I'm looking for interesting ideas for games/activities to play in the pubs to keep everyone having a good time. I've been googling non-stop but been coming up blank.If it helps the guy loves his music,movies, video games,craft beers he's very laid back but I know he'd appreciate doing something a little different and creative. Really appreciate any tips what so ever.Thanks.
