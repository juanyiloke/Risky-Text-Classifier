it's just one of those nightsI'm sure many of you can relate...  Just feeling not well and not being able to relax.There is a chance it's allergies or maybe just strictly stress.  It's a little different than the usual feeling though, which is scary.  I feel very warm, but not sweaty, some tingling in hands and feet, fluttery/tingling feeling in head.  Tightness in jaw. Some indigestion.  Does anyone else feel like their bodies are extremely sensitive to changes in weather and seasons?  It's not really a sneezy kind of allergy, but feeling drowsy all day and crappy at night.  And obviously my anxiety goes into overdrive; it tends to do so whenever I feel crappy.  Hoping talking (typing) about it can help.  It feels like not much is helping; this started to get bad around 9pm (2100). I wish I had gone to sleep before then.  But now I have someone sleeping over.  I feel bad for even having them here because I've pretty much just isolated myself.  I tend to get snippy at others when I feel uncomfortable.  Which is fairly often.  So yeah, here I am.   :p
