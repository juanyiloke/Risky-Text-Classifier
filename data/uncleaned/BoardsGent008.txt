Sick of being single, i need a womanHi all,ÊRight so thought I give this a go. Im sick of being single, im a 25 year old alright looking fella. I moved to from Donegal to Dublin about a year a go. I don't really know anybody down here, well apart from the fellas at work, but cant really see myself going out for a pint with them well maybe if I made the effort but anyway, I really want and need to meet someone, id be fairly shy so I don't know to go about it. I know a nightclub would be best but theres bound others places?? Im not on tinder or anything I've a brick of a phone and couldn't be arsed with online dating, any suggestions?Thanks.
