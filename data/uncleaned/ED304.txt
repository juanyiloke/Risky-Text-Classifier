ÊI can't talk to my boyfriend about my ED???My boyfriend and I were considering moving in together, but i wanted to explain to him about my E.D, since I've been hiding it from him for two years. I felt it was important to tell him not only because he needed to know what he was getting into if we lived together, but because he had some hand in the cause of it. I told him through text and he never replied to me until the next day.ÊI confronted him about why he never replied and told me he just didn't want to talk to me because I pissed him off and completely avoided the whole conversation. After he's just acting like everything is back to normal and being all cheery with me but I'm so angry and frustrated and hurt to the point where I am seriously debating if i should leave him. My family is unsupportive as it is and I feel that if I can't confide in him I don't know if I should be with him.ÊI need advice on how to deal with this please..
