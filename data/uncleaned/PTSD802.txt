Êlong term clinicI've just had a long chat with my psychiatrist and although she was very sweet and even called me sweetheart the outcome is not very good.ÊSince taking the clozapine in tablets instead of a drink the amount in my blood has gone down drastically even though it's the same dose. I swore to her that I am not spitting them out I let her check my bag that I'm not keeping them for an overdose and eventually she decided to up the dose and see what my blood results will be when I'm on 700mg. She nearly put me back on the drink which is disgusting.ÊShe wants to send me to a long term therapy clinic which has a waiting list of six months and you stay there for up to two years, sectioned. She believes they can help me in therapy with my traumas. That means I can't go to uni in September. It means I could be sectioned for a maximum of another 2,5 years.ÊShe says I'm deteriorating since taking the clozapine in tablets. And after the suicide attempt this weekend she has decided to keep me on 1-1 and no more escorted walking outside.ÊThis all is a lot to take in.ÊThanks for reading it all and please can someone help me.ÊI'm so confused.
