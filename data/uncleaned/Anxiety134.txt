Help pleaseeee:(Ok so iv been suffering from health anxiety for a while now since September/October last year when I fount some lymph nodes up in my neck, I had the doctor check these which he said he wasn't worried about. After numerous times going back he finally referred me for bloods which all came back normal. I know everybody says to stay away from Google but I have been searching and all that comes up is lymphoma. The doctor is sending me for an ultrasound on these but not until May 2nd and further bloods may 6th this is so long away! Every ache/pain I feel like it's all cancer relatedCan anxiety do this to me? I just keep feeling down and depressed about it. To the point where I'm having mood swings and taking it all out on my partner!What I would like to know is if it was cancer would I have severe symptoms of this? I feel like I'm getting symptoms of cancer but would that be because iv read up on it I'm looking into it too much? I just need my mind to be put at rest. Thank you xx
