Will VHI cover Gynecomastia surgery?I've had gynaecomastia since 11 (almost 16 now) and I'm quite convinced that it won't go away  It's completely shattering my self-confidence, and has partially made me extremely shy and un-outgoing. I can't wear the clothes that I want since my feckin' swollen nipples showsup through them, unless it's a large hoodie etc.I have VHI insurance cover (according to the mammy) and was wondering if they will cover it. I've heard that they won't cover aesthetic procedures, but if I can get a GP to write a referral letter to a specialist presenting it as a "medical" procedure, they will. Is this true? How likely will this happen (I don't wanna pay for the GP if it isn't going to happen). Also, where would be the best place to get it done?Cheers all!
