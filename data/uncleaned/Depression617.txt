How do you cope with indelicate questions?Started by selena?, 25-04-15 04:41 PMNow I wish to write about unpleasant moments that make my depressive moods harder. For example, I have hormonal problems and I lost some weight and it was not simple for me and suddenly a relative, a friend or a colleague tries to talk about my sensitive issue ( or any others). I get nervous because some people don't understand that I'm fed up with this kind of questions, many times repetitive. How on Earth do they know what I am facing? How do they know I haven't been trying?It's beyond my comprehension. I am feeling in those moments ashamed and lost, because some issues are clearly not my fault. I could stay relaxed but then that provokes a pain to me. This kind of questions could also be related to someone's private life, having or not having children. And their painful nonsense pieces of advice.I try to avoid these people but it's not always simple.How do you handle these provocative moments?
