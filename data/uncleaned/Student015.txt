 Dropping out of Law for art history??? Help!!by rupaulI'm just finishing first year of a BCL degree in University College Dublin. I've had the worst year of my life if I'm totally honest. My classes have been boring, the campus and student body was massive and I have hardly learnt a thing. Law just isn't for me, and I know I don't want a career in anything law-related. However I am not awful at it, I didnt do a lot of work this year and I still managed to get a 2:1.Anyway, I am able to move to Trinity College and study Art History and French for September. I really don't know if I should! I want to have a career in an art related field, be it in curating, auctioneering or journalism etc. but when I tell people that I'm thinking of leaving law they look at me like I'm nuts. It's too late to apply to UCAS and I don't want to waste another year (and I would rather not have student debt) so TCD is my only option as a university. Is this held in high regard amongst places where I could do an art history masters degree?So I have two pathways planned out:1. Finish the BCL, do a 2 year graduate diploma in Art History at the Cortauld Institute then do a mastersor2. Quit law and do a BA in Art History in TCD. Then do a masters.I'm not sure which to do!Will having a law degree serve me better than the BA, even if I want to work in the arts sector? and is Trinity's reputation good? If anyone knows any answers or has any advice please reply.
