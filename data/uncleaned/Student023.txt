Withdrawing from Uniby Danie96Hey! I'm currently taking my first year exams at Uni and I've decided that after my exams are done I'm going to withdraw and take a year out. I've decided that the course I'm on isn't really what I want to do and I don't really want to waste 3 year of my life doing something I dont like. I will hopefully then reapply next year for something I really want to do. My problem here is that i know i haven't done well enough in some of my exams to pass. But I don't want to leave the University feeling disappointed in myself and then when I apply again, other Universities will look at my grades and think that I didn't try. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has been in position and what they did? Should I retake my exams even though I know I'll probably fail again as I have no motivation and interest to revise for something I hate?
