ÊAnxiety Issues....For about the past 10 yrs I feel like I have been suffering from some type of anxiety disorder. I also think the the anxiety has caused off and on depression and has led to severe mood swings. I have been prescribed several meds over the yrs by my primary dr. Nothing really seemed to help. I do take valium occasionally and I take 1/2 of a 10 mg ambien every night. I recently saw a psychiatrist and she thinks I'm not really depressed but that I have really horrible mood swings, so she prescribed me Lamictal. I am on a 25 mg dose for now and I up it after 2 weeks. I have been on it for 5 days. The 1st day I took it, I was in the best mood ever but now I am so angry and easily agitated. Has anyone else had these issues?
