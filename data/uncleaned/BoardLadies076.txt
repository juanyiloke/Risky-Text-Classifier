"You are my whole world"Ladies, just wondering if I'm just come about this or if others agree with me? I was reading this story and found myself disagreeing with the tone it was going and the whole idea that an OH has to be your whole world and you can't survive without them. Now I'm not saying that I wouldn't be devastated if something happened to my OH, I certainly would be, but I do think that the boyfriend has a point in saying that he'd want others around him so that he wouldn't end up with a lonely life without his girlfriend.Then again, maybe I'm just not romantic enough! Or over thinking!
