Endgame!!¥	Hello to all you lovely friends just needed to share with you that I've had enough!!! Chemo no. 5 last Friday usual routine (for me!) sickness nausea sickness bed,24 hours anti- sickness syringe into my tummy this time as arm developed a hard lump then wake up and off we go again. Next few days not too bad in the sense that once syringe removed the anti sick meds seemed to control things quite well then CONSTIPATION!!!!!!! Happens every time and I'm sure we all get it but this time despite the sennaside(!!) it seemed worse. My main problem is drinking, cannot even stand water when I've just had chemo so I try everything but I know that is probably the main reason. So basically I have developed a nasty tear ( anal fissure) and it is sooooooo painful.¥	i am eating fruit/ veg all things that will help but being nauseous a lot I have to have what I fancy and can tolerate and take the nasty taste away.¥	I feel I have done pretty well getting this far(5) and am very tempted to stop at 5 I just feel I can't stand this change in my otherwise normal life for much longer. ¥	Can anyone suggest something to soften my stool( of course I could go to the GP but I'd like to try first) I am putting sudocrem on the sore area (well that's hit & miss can't see what I'm doing and the extra stone in weight certainly isn't helping!!!)¥	So you see I've just about had it I made the decision to go with chemo even though it only gave me an extra 3% reduced risk of return I suppose I feel I've done more than I needed to but will I regret not taking that last one.........HELP!!!¥	Genny (positioned on a cushion with raised buttock!!!)
