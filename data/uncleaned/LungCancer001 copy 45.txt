Tarceva+Ketogenic dietI am a NSCLC patient EGFR+ and 9 months ago I started a treatment with Tarceva. Some integrative oncologists have recommended me to start a ketogenic diet (that is, a diet very low in carbohidrats, moderate in proteins and high in fat). They claim that this diet can slow down cancer progression since cancer depends very much on blood sugar. I think that this diet may interfere with tarceva. For that reason, my question is: Are you aware of any experience of patients taking Tarceva and a ketogenic diet? What was the outcome?Thank you very much...Josepma
