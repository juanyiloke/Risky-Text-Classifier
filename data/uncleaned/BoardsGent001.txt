Hair Loss - Current Standards and Near Future TreatmentsHi,My hairline is receding badly and although I've been taking finasteride for a number of years it is not really purported to combat frontal/temple hair loss.I'm not going to shave my hair as the bald/shaved look does not suit me.Has anyone on here got any recent experience of transplants and what is involved in their maintenance. My understanding is that in order to prevent future loss that you must maintain finasteride usage. What is the quality like and do the reconstructed hairlines looks any better now than previously?As an aside, where is research going? I am aware of treatments such as Histogram, PRP, and Replicel but I've no idea as to how close they are (currently in trials stage) to market.I'd assume that the best chance is for hair loss to piggyback on some type of gene theraphy for another condition and extrapolate it for overcoming hair loss.Yes, maybe if you have oodles of confidence then you could get on with things in life, but that shouldn't fit with me unfortunately.
