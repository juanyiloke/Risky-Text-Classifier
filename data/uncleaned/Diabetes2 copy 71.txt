What age should I start planning a baby at?   When I was 15, I was really Ill and my mum thought I might be diabetic, so she took me to the doctors who gave me a bloods form. I was told I needed to book an appointment in my hospital but as I had already fasted my mum phoned up and they told me to come straight in to the children ward. They took various tests and discovered that I had just started to get over Glandular fever. Which had caused the enzymes in my liver to be disturbed and caused me to have hepatitis. Luckily It went after 6 months. However they also found out that I am GAD positive. After 2 years in Diabetic clinic they discharged me as I was doing fine. Before I left they discussed about me having children. They told me not to leave it too late as the chances are that I will become diabetic once I'm pregnant. The longer I leave it the more likely my chances are. They told me I need to plan the pregnancy as I will need tests done beforehand and right throughout. I'm 17 now, I will be 18 next May. I don't want children in the next few years, but after watching a program the other night about a girl with type 1 diabetes, who was pregnant and had to spend 2 months in hospital and give birth when she was 7 months due to kidney failure, it scared me. I don't want to wait too long and increase my risk of getting type 1 diabetes and harm any future baby I have. The hospital never told me what age I should start to think about having children though to decrease that risk, does anyone have any ideas?
