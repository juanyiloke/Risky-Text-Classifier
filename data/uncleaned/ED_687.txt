gained weight, boyfriend making comments.Hi everyone....Its been a long time since I last posted here. I stopped purging for awhile and was doing (somewhat) okay. Recently I've been struggling a bit due to the fact I have gained weight. My eating is all screwed up, I will go long periods of time without eating and then 'binge'. My purging is sporadic now, and mostly done when I'm upset. I'm miserable with the weight gain .Yesterday, my boyfriend made a comment about how I've gained weight and how I would look better if I were thinner. I felt, and feel, so disgusting. He says I can't keep "starving myself" because it screws with my weight. He said to exercise and eat healthily. I don't know how to do those things, even when I try I end up back to not eating and purging. He doesn't know this, and I'm not willing to tell him.ÊI feel so terrible, I just want to purge. I don't know what to do. How do I cope with the weight gain? How do I cope with these comments?
