Trying To Stretch A Good DayAfter three days of bad (increased) symptoms, I am having a good day today, and I don't want it to end. How do you stretch a good day? Obviously I have to go to sleep at some point, but I'm worried (damn anxiety!) about waking up and not having a good day tomorrow or the next day.I know I can just try to remember what it feels like to have a good day, to know that it's possible and there may be one around the corner at any given time. That helps to an extent. But I want more.
