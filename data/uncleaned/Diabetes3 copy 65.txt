AdviceHi i would like some advice please I was diagnosed with T2 last November and was told not to test my BG but I have been testing. I went for a review with the DN a few weeks ago and told her I was testing (she didn’t seem happy that I was testing after she told me I didn’t need to when I was diagnosed) but not testing regularly and that my BG was nearly always between 7-14 and that I was also suffering with headaches most days to which she told me to cut down on the carbs which I told her I have already done and all she said was she would review it in 6 months time.I have been testing my blood 3 times a day for the the last couple of weeks when I get up and before my tea and 2hours after tea and my readings are still 7.0-14.4 and most days I am still getting headaches I just don’t know what else I can do as the DN didn’t seem interested. I did go and see the doctor a month ago about the headaches and they said it was my body changing to deal with the diabetes and gave me some painkillers but I’m still suffering just don’t know what I should do any help would be appreciated.Thanks Owen
