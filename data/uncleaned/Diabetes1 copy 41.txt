Is a no carb evening meal good or bad thing....?Was tired last night, was having fish and French beans for supper, forgot to cook the beans, so just had fish, with butter, so no carbs. Then I got to wondering, is no carbs a good or bad thing in terms of morning liver dump?! All my readings other than fasting now usually seem OK. Read a few interesting posts about eating a snack before bed to help avoid higher morning fasting reading.. Should any snack positively include some good, low GI carbs, or aim for carb free? I guess I'll experiment, test, and know we are all different, but any thoughts appreciated.Have a good day.D
