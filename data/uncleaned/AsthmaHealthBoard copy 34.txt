Is this Asthma?________________________________________Hi,Just 1 month ago I started to take medication for asthma (advair 250/50) and when I started it did help a little but right now I feel the same again. To make a long story short this all started around 9 months ago, first they said it was anxiety, then reflux and now asthma. (maybe all 3) They have done every possible test they can do and I'm taking medication for all 3 and still the same. Yes, the anxiety medication helps a little but far away from feeling human again. So basically even doing nothing at home I have these symptoms unless I lay or sleep. I get up and within minutes the pain and pressure is back unless under anxiety medication which helps a little. I seen every specialty you can see for this- GI's, ENT's, PCD, Neuro, Cardio, Lung specialist, allergy/asthma specialist and Psy. Done endoscopy twice, Colonoscopy, MRI's, CT's, blood test for everything.Now, my question is this. 2 of my Docs which both deal with asthma said I might have asthma so they put me on advair 250- One month later I don't feel any better. I asked my Primary to give me a referral for MAYO clinic and he thinks I should wait because he see no reason for this. Any comment or suggestion is appreciated.Jose
