A couple days ago, I missed two doses of risperidone. I woke up at midnight with that familiar psychotic terror as if I had just woken from a nightmare. I heard dying cats under my bed and immediately turned the light on and went to the bathroom where I saw myself distorted in the mirror. I ended up sleeping with the light on. One of the last things I remember from that night is seeing part of the wall sculptured as Marilyn Monroe.I don't normally have such vivid visual hallucinations. After missing just two doses of risperidone within one day, this happened. I'm afraid to miss a single dose now. Has anyone else had returning symptoms like this after missing only a few doses?
