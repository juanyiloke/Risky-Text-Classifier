Emerging From The Hole.Hi guys.After about 10 years of virtual unemployment, and believing quite seriously that I was for the most part a pretty useless human being, I am finally, at the tender age of thirty years old, starting to realize that I might possibly have a normal life moving forward.I'm not going to go into too much detail, as it's Friday night, and I need to relax, and I am on my way out in a couple minutes.I am currently looking after a kid with (mild) cerebral palsy (his mom is ill). It's been a learning curve, as I don't have kids, but what a rewarding thing to be doing. :)Today, I got news that I got a job in a bookshop that I applied for a couple weeks back, and the combination of these two things will cover the bills and more for the medium term future, which is like a yolk off my neck, I can tell you.I'm still full of the anxiety and depression that got me here, but it's not controlling me any longer, I am kicking it's skinny bottom (well, me, my friends and family as well as Citalopram, but you know what I mean!).Things can and do get better, is all I'm saying.Have a good weekend all.
