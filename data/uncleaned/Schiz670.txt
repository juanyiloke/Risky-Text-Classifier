ÊVoices gone but....So I just went through a idk I guess it's called a psychotic break but I was diagnosed with depression with psychosis. I'm almost back to normal but now I'm totally paranoid that when I leave rooms people are talking about me....idk if I've always been this insecure or if it's still some of the psychosis. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like I might have developed some social anxiety. Which was weird because I worked hearing the voices for at least 3 months and no one knew. They think I quit because I was depressed which I couldnt careless if they know because I was depressed because I was hearing voices but they don't know about the voices. The paranoia isn't about the people I work with...it's even with friends.....but yeah again I ask has anyone else experienced this??
