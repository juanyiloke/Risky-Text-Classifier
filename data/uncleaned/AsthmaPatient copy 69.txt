Reviewers wanted for Medikidz, Health Education Medikidz is a new initiative in health education for young people. They are looking for young people nationwide (aged 8-15 years) to become part of their growing testing group. This includes reviewing comic books and a website. They would especially be interested to engage with young people who may have experience of one of the conditions they explain. Medikidz would be able to send sample copies of comic books on Asthma, Epilepsy, Scoliosis, Leukaemia, HIV, Osteosarcoma and Breast Cancer to any young person interested in giving them feedback.Medikidz was set up to explain medicine to young people in a way they can understand. As well as comic books on different conditions (such as ADHD, Type 1 Diabetes, Food Allergy and Brain Tumours) they are also creating pamphlets about procedures and medications (e.g. “Medikidz Explain a MRI scan”).If you know of young people who may indeed like to become a 'Medikidz' reviewer please contact Kate James at
