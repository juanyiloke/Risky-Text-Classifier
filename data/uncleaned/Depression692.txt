I've lost my motivation....has anyone seen it?Started by pinkpanther96?, 15-01-15 12:39 PMHi everyone,I could really do with some advice on how to motivate myself to do work. I have two exams and two coursework essays to do over the next two weeks and I haven't revised enough so I know that this is the time to get my head down and concentrate....but I really can't. I can work for half an hour max and then it's like my brain just freezes and refuses to do anything else. This is annoying in itself but then I get worked up and frustrated because I'm not working, I waste time just sitting at my desk staring at the wall...so I just end up feeling even more down and completely de-motivated. Does anyone else experience this?
