ÊVenting, for the most part.......I'm not sure if this post should even go here, or if it belongs, necessarily. Maybe it's just me being wacky again and imagining things, or wanting things that probably wouldn't happen anyways, it's complex.I keep taking the bpd tests on here (as well as other sites, where it always comes out as likely), one always says "likely" the other always says "unlikely" and it bothers me. I've seen 3 therapists, ran off from each one and don't have money to see another, so that's out of the question. So I just have to figure things out all on my own, but for the past few months I've pretty much been a recluse (not really of my choice, no one asks me to do anything with them, and again I have no money), so I can't even answer the tests honestly, I can only base them off of me staying home doing nothing, or me thinking about how I would have reacted to things in the past.I just don't know if this fits me or not. Some people from the past thought it did, but they could also be wrong. I read some of the posts here, and I can relate, granted most are in the "You know you are borderline when...." section (so maybe anyone can relate to some of those).I'm just confused.............Sorry, been trying to talk for days, afraid of saying anything for fear of how people would react, either they'll think poorly of me or they'll ignore me altogether, as I see it.........Vent over......
