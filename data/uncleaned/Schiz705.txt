ÊAuditory HallucinationsI am wondering if anyone else experiences critical auditory hallucinations ONLY when they are around other people?Whenever I am in public I hear people berating me and all of the people are addressing the issues I am feeling self conscious about, but I don't have berating auditory hallucinations if I am by myself. I will have intrusive thoughts that do not feel like they are mine and they do not feel like they came from me, but never multiple voices and never a constant narration like it is when I am in public.
