Travel InsuranceFor many years we had a world wide annual travel insurance with our credit card company for which we paid an annual fee of £35.  My husband was the main card holder even though I had a card in just my name, but on his passing the card company cancelled the card and with it the travel insurance which had only just been paid for this year.Now my niece wants to take me to visit my husbands niece who lives in Las Vegas, I've been a few times in the past and love the atmosphere of the place apart from the fun aspects.  However, on looking at travel insurance I'm astonished at the prices I've been quoted, as I said, we paid £35 for joint, annual, world wide and my husband had many major ailments including a heart transplant.  I've got gall stones which haven't troubled me for years, palpitations and hiatus hernia for which I have medication and the cheapest insurance for a single 7 day trip, with excess of £150, is around £150   Can anyone recommend a cheaper insurance?
