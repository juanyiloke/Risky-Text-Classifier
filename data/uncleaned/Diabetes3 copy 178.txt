Survived the Annual Review!Just come back from the annual review. New DN is just as idiotic as the last one was! Must make sure all meals are between 45 - 60% carbohydrate. No more that 4 squares of chocolate per day and cake/ biscuits 4 times per week. (dont eat these anyway.) Restrict alcohol (I had already told her I don't drink) Don't need to test etc etc. Says nothing more can be done about the thyroid results. Also although the lab has said that she should monitor some protein and creatinine in my urine she says it is all fine.She said I am doing well after 5 years. I pointed out that I have only been diagnosed for two! Only downside was that she wants to see me again in 6 months   but I am a happydog today.Thank goodness for this forum and the wise people on here.
