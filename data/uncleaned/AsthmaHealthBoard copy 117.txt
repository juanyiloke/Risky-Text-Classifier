Exercise Induced Bronchospasm________________________________________Here is what is currently going on with me. I have had breathing issues for the last 5 years, pretty much ever since I finished chemotherapy back in 2009. Before then, I was healthy and could run and exercise until my body was physically ready to give up. After having gone through chemotherapy, I can no longer do the activities I used to enjoy. I have been seen by multiple doctors, cardiologists, allergists, pulmonologist, and ENT. I have been through multiple forms of testing to determine if I have asthma…every test out there comes back normal. They have thoroughly checked my heart, and I have a very small heart murmur. I do have hay fever/seasonal allergies pretty much year round, and I was once told I have GERD, although I have never felt any symptoms of that. Today I had an appointment with a new pulmonologist. He took a very thorough history on me and did an exam. He took chest x-rays, which were normal, and had me do a PFT, and spirometry test today, which also came back normal…but I have been on inhalers prior to these tests. After all was said and done, he diagnosed me with exercise induced bronchospasm. I believe his diagnosis is accurate since a majority of the time, my symptoms are triggered by exercise, especially exercise in cold weather. What I am confused on is if this is asthma or something different. I have googled many things and one thing says you can have EIB without having asthma, and then the next says EIB is a form of asthma. I would just like to know if it is or isn't asthma. Any help, suggestions, advice…or even just a "hey, I have been there" would be greatly appreciated. Also, is anyone on here embarrassed of using an inhaler in public? Does that eventually go away with time? I cannot seem to bring myself to use mine around other people. Sorry for the long post, I am newly diagnosed and have lots of questions!
