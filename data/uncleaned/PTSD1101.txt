I was diagnosed with ptsd a few months ago after a car accident on May 10th. We were rear-ended without notice. I had my two girls in the car, morgan my 5yr old with no injuries and hailey 8 yr who suffered fromwhiplash, at the time. I have whiplash still after 6 months considered chronic and working on dif ways to get better. I have had a tough time doing my duties as a mom since I am unable to do most of my daily activities. My daughter, who we took to the doc for all the tummy aches & headaches and anxiety, told us that she just needs to pay attention to her body more and shes fine. So I finally talked to the school counselor & nurse and they suggested a family service group who can talk to my daughter and see whats going on. So after a 2 hour meeting today, she was officially diagnosed with PTSD. How can I help her? I have a hard time controlling my emotions and feelings, when she gets upset and I cant do anything to help, I send her in a different room til we both calm down and can discuss it, little things that aren't a big deal normally, til it over. I hope I gave enough info, hard to keep it together in my head while tryin to write so much. Thanks for taking the time to read my post!
