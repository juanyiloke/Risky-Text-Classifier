No Replies ?What I can never understand - and let me make it quite clear it is not specific to this Forum alone.Is why people make a post of a specific nature -  to which the possible answers would be  very important to them - ie. asking for sometimesurgent advice - which is usually given asasp !Then there  is never any indication { From some  that is } that they have never returned to the original posting to read any replies to their very important request  !Either they could not be bothered returning to it - In that case why make the post in the first place ?Or if they have found the time to return and read the replies - why not take a few seconds  more to say -What a load of Rubbish you have replied   or      Thanks for that info -   I will act on it.Fred
