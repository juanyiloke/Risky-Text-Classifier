Jelly babies at dawnMy son, who was diagnosed in February 2014 was clearly honeymooning all through the summer months, with perfect levels. No one told us about this of course. Steadily as the weather got colder and then following a virus his insulin needs increased, in fact almost doubled.As Spring approaches, we seem to be reversing again, cutting insulin slowly but still waking in the 3's. It is not that warm yet, even here in mediterranean Essex, so can he have a second honeymoon?
