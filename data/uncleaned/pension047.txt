Supporting Mrs Abu HamzarMrs Abu Hamzar is currently now paid £33,800 a year by us the UK taxpayer and Nick Clegg thinks its a good thing we do and supports her present appeal against the benefits cap. Aren't we lucky to have the Liberals balancing things out for the Coalition in this way. Nick ensures we pay to keep this terrorist’s family shacked up in one of the best areas of London in a house three-quarters of the population couldn’t afford, even if they earned £100,000 a year.Clegg says it’s Hamza who’s been sent to prison, not his family, so they shouldn’t be punished. Which is rubbish, because four of his sons and a stepson HAVE served time in jail – two for terrorism offences.So why doesn't Hamza’s family go live in the US so they can visit him in jail?Oh, hang on – they can’t, because America wouldn't let them set foot on US soil. What a shame they haven't got Nick over there to even things out, in the good old Liberal way?
