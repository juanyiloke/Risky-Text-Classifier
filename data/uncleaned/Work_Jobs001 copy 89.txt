7000 Û for health care________________________________________Hi allI'd like to get some advice. My health insurance was always taking off from my salary my old company covered 100% of it and the new one meant to cover 65% we were transferred from vendor to another vendorFirst month I received 600 Û health insurance bonus even my plan is 85 Û a month. I thought my company paid me the cover already for the whole year. When I received the next month again 600 Û I went to HR and their answer was (I have even an email about it) that this is correct as health insurance plan costs around 7000 Û a year. I left it for another month and went then with my boss to HR to get an explanation again. Apparently the old company signed me up for a premium family plan and because this was a transfer they had to take this over and need to pay me this amount. I even seen it now on the document they gave us where it states what the old company did for us and what the new one will take over. It clearly says health insurance premium family cover plan and new company covers around 7000 Û yearI find this all so ridiculous first of all I cannot even find such an expensive plan plus I only signed up for a normal one back in the days and now. I really don't know what to do anymore I cannot enjoy that money knowing this cannot be possible. How can I cover myself? Its hard to put 600 Û beside each month and never touching it until the day they might want it backI didn't hide anything I showed HR even my old payslips Thanks in advance
