Feeling so downI feel so down and I don't know what to do but I do know that I don't want to go to the doctor for anti-depressants, I'm already on too many medications for the diabetes etc. I am missing Susie so much, the house is so empty and my life revolved around her, I loved her so much and for the last three years, due to both mine and her health I was with her virtually all of the time apart from going to bed (when Susie could no longer get up the stairs) and odd trips out to the shops etc - which was maybe once or twice a week. I miss her so much and I've found out the wrong way, getting a dog is not the answer. Will this pain ever go away? Is there anything that I can do in the meantime that I can do to reduce the pain of the grieving - I've put together photo books, made a Susie memorial and written up her memories. I know that I need to move forward but don't know how to do this without her. I'm trying to do things like watch films, book pottery classes, go out for meals etc but everything feels so empty. I risk making myself very ill. Sorry for the ramble. I'm exhausted - it has been a very difficult last three years due to health problems but I could manage whilst I had Susie.
