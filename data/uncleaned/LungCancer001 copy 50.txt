HelloHi everyone, I'm new to the forum and was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer on 3/1/2014.I'm really having a hard time digesting the whole thing. At first I was holding it together for my kids. At least until I told them. I just kinda stuffed everything inside. Well yesterday I finally broke down because I realized that there really is no recovering from this type of cancer. I'm angry, scared, broken hearted because I know I won't see my grandson grow up, and my mother already lost one daughter, it's not fair that she should have to bury another. Anyway, I'm here.I just need to know that there are others out there to talk to.
