coming outI spend my time thinking of food....and have eating disorder symptoms. I havemt lost any weight. When I amtired or stressed I eat. I was out with my friends for a meal....and I cant recall what we were talking about but I said out loud "I have a problrm with food". It was the first time isaid it to them and it felt wrird and good ay the same time to admit that I have a problem. My domestic life isnt great at the moment. I work full time. I dont say anything to my husband...he eld just say dont engage in eating disorder symptoms...if he sees me eating a whole pile of food hr makes a pig noise. Suppose he tjinks its funny. He also is a comfort eater and feels down about overeating. I supposr the point of ghis mesage is I do have a problem...I knoe if I talked to someone about what I do I miht feel a bit vetter but I sm mot goingvto tell my friends I struggle with eating disorder symptoms. I am mot gping to the doctor either as I am not ill and I dont reslly want to make it official. So reslly looking for suggestions on how to break this cycle
