DS is in his own bed, and goes to bed each night at about 7:30 pm. He has a regular bedtime routine.I have a couple of things I'd like to change.1-I of us currently lies in bed with ds until he falls asleep. This takes 20-40 mind each night on average. I'd like to come to a point where we can say goodnight, and let him just drift off by himself, but at the moment, he will just get up  2-he comes into our room every night, anytime from 11pm to the early hours. I don't mind this, but he is very fidgety, and DH and I don't really get a good night's sleep. I have 4 days off next week, so was thinking of perhaps trying to do rapid repeat?Any advice, or should I wait until he is older? If I do decide to go for it, should I spend the next few days trying to get ds excited about staying in his own bed all night?I know that we are quite lucky sleep wise, but I would like my half of the bed back
