Balance - a mention for the forumJust got the latest issue of Balance (magazine for Diabetes UK supporting members) and it has an article about the use of social media for support. I did a phone interview for this, so we do get a mention, although not really much detail about what was discussed, unfortunately - I don't really think it conveys the benefits of this place adequately   It itemises all the different avenues for support - Peer to Peer, twitter, facebook, Google+ Hangouts etc., and our forum. Personally, and I have said this many times and said it in the interview, I am very wary of twitter and facebook - they are fine for general support, but potentially troublesome for newly-diagnosed due to difficulties in monitoring. Of course, there are always disclaimers that any information given shouldn't override medical opinion, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. I think something that is also important is that these are often 'generational' platforms and perhaps less-suited to the 35+ age groups (obviously a huge generalisation!), both in their accessibility and operation. Or maybe I'm just biased. OK, I know I'm biased, but chiefly because I've seen some horrible things happen on twitter and FB that just wouldn't happen here. I'd be interested to hear others' opinions on the article if you read it
