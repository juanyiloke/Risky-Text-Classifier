ÊGaslighting?I am in a 24-year marriage. Our relationship has become very challenging. For years, I have viewed him as very emotionally abusive, but I have never really done anything about it.This last 1-1/2 years, I have been very symptomatic. I have PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. I have been hospitalized multiple times. I went to a trauma recovery center for 4 weeks where I started therapy in CPT for my PTSD, and DBT for the Borderline. I came back stronger and more sure of myself. While I have made inroads in being assertive, he continues to bully me at times.I can recognize the abuse cycle, but every time I think about leaving, all I can think about is him telling me that my perception of his behavior is all in my head because of my mental illness. What if I leave and he is right and I have just made the biggest mistake of my life? What if he is right and I am so sick that I can't take care of myself? I have three kids (2 teenagers and one a young adult) to consider, too. I just don't know what to do.Can anyone else relate?
