Gary Mabbut...A friend told me over the weekend he had heard Gary Mabbut on Radio 5 Live talking about the bypass he had done two years ago following what he described as a "leg attack" (c.f. heart attack). Gary had to give up his ambitions to be a football trainer/manager as he can never run or kick a ball again., and now has to lead a more sedentary life style. We need more broadcasts like this to get the serious of PAD across to people in general, and to those providing diabetic care!
