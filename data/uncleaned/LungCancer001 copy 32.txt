Just diagnosed with a rare cancer - Extrapulmonary Small-Cell CarcinomaHere is a link to explain the cancer I have. Neither of my very experienced oncologists have had a patient with it.http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf...41860802495370The cancer is localized in my axillary lymph nodes of one armpit. It is considered Limited, Localized, and they are treating with "curative intent."My concern is that of the treatment plan. How can they know how to treat this effectively? Literature says it has a decent prognosis if treated with multiple modalities.I am getting two drugs which I've started: Cisplatin and Etopomide, and I start radiation next week. Are my doctors likely to consult on this with experts who may have experience? If not, how can I find doctors with this experience to at least get opinions and guidance to know if my doctors are doing the right thing?
