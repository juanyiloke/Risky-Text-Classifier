Asthma  8  I am 60 yrs old and an asthma & crohn's patient. I take restricted food daily as per doctor's instruction. Now I feel much better. Every morning I feel breathing uneasiness  but when as day pass on it becomes nil. Is it due to lack of breathing exercise? What should I do to get rid of completely from mucus lining on air passage? Avoid a certain food will solve the problem? Use of inhaler daily may be good in younger stage. But as you as you are getting old, you have to increase the dose.
