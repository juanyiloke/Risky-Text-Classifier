What's the point?How I feel and what I'm thinking just do not matter. Every time I try to open up, nobody is bothered or just puts it one side and dismisses it. Or I just get plain ignored. I know no one is going to have the answer, there may not even be an answer but I feel so alone and nobody is listening to me. You know, if someone just took some time to listen then maybe it would help relieve some of this pain, even if they can't offer and advice back. I'm all over the place inside and I can't even make sense of things myself and nobody will listen to me. I feel like I just don't matter to anybody. People are better off without me.
