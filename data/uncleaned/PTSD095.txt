MemoryI need to vent a little and would like to start a general chat about memory and PTSD.I'm so sick of my memory issues. It's like I live every day just tuned into the day. I don't recall things well. I rely on my phone to remind me of every little thing. I'm here, now (except not totally, I know because of how well I respond to real crises...with lots of clarity). People ask me to tell them when something started and I don't remember.I try to remember things and am often so blank. So numb. Earlier today for the first few hours in public I had this horrible icky feeling inside. Except a few people said I must be in a good mood since I was smiling. I didn't feel like I was smiling. That's just so disconcerting... to have no real sense of being connected to how your emotions look to others. Scary and uncomfortable and puts me on edge, thinking I must pay extra attention to my face and voice.The emotion of the day got better but now that I am home away from people I feel numb again. I'm tired of trying to guess at how people want me to respond to them. I'm tired of feeling like years of school are just wasted since I don't remember things. I'm tired of struggling to keep track of stuff.I'm angry that I struggle with memory and wish I didn't. I wish I had the kind of mental clarity I get in a crisis more of the time. It's like I pull all of myself here when there is a crisis...but that means most of the time I'm not all here. I feel like I'm fighting myself, and there's lots of stress when I start to feel more. So confusing and exhausting.I figured others can relate to this subject.What have you experienced as far as memory and trauma? Are you struggling to keep track of things? Anything you find that helps you remember better?
