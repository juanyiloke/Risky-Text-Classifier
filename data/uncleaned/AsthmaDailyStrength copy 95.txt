Hello. I suffer with mild but chronic asthma. About 3 years ago, I contracted the H1N1 virus and developed pneumonia in both lungs. I was on a ventilator for about 10 days and in hospital and rehab for almost 5 weeks. I recovered fairly nice and am happy to be alive. About 2 weeks ago, I went to Colorado where the air is much thinner. I've had altitude issues before and decided to call the pulmonologist office. I should have done it sooner but was positive I would not have any issues. They wanted me to to have an arterial blood gas test done at the hospital. I did not hear anything from them and assumed I would be okay. Well, a few days into my trip, I realized I was having issues. I did not have an oxygen rx but found a company that delivered oxygen to the hotel (this is very common in Colorado). Just after I ordered the oxygen, my doctor's office called me and said that my oxygen level was low for the altitude. I missed the call and it was late on a Friday afternoon before Labor Day. I could not call them back until the day after we got back. I spoke with the doctor's office and told them the situation. The nurse said she would talk to the doctor. After playing phone tag, I spoke with them this morning and they said I would need oxygen at sea level too. They said it would only be used during exercise. I was really shocked. I'm not having any symptoms and feel fine. I get winded during exercise some time but assumed it was from pushing myself in the exercise. I always recover pretty quickly. The nurse said that this would not be long term. Anyone else have this issue? It really floored me.
