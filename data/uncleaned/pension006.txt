Blair - what a despicable man he is!In spite of the mourning families request, Blair had the temerity, the effrontery, the gaul to attend the memorial service for those killed in the illegal, unnecessary war in Afghanistan that he took us into. He has to be one of the most repulsive people I've come across and only hope that his next big public appearance will be before the Hague answering to the war crimes he has committed. UGH, makes me quite sick!
