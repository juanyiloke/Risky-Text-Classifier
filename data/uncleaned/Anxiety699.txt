"Blip" after fluI've been coping well with anxiety on a daily dose of 5 mg escitalopram since the start of the year. Over Easter my partner had flu and was ill for over a week. I'd been vaccinated, so I didn't get the full deal, but had a mild version with aching muscles and felt really tired. Then a couple of days ago I woke up feeling anxious and weepy. The world has gone back to looking pretty bleak again. Nothing else has changed, so I assume it's just a post-viral symptom like the tiredness and will go in time, hopefully! Has anyone else experienced this?
