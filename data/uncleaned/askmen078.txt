Treasury bonds or certificate of deposit2013-01-13, 12:00 PM1/ If one has an extra $5k lying around, which is a better investment for me --- treasury bonds or certificate of deposits?Ê2/ If one has an extra $30k lying around, which is a better investment?Ê3/ And no I have no interest in purchasing real estate. Please don't bother convincing me otherwise. I have heard all arguments about it. I'm just not interested in becoming a home owner in the next decade. Nor do I intend to go into the stock market since I am not interested in that. A coworker mentioned buying gold or diamonds as an investment. What woman doesn't like jewelry?!? LolMy financial objective is to increase my present savings by the end of the 2013. Unlike most people, I took the year off to go to grad school (I will graduate in December, take the boards in January) and just relax and live my life. I've been working AND studying non-stop for years plus I took care of my family too. So I figured this year is MY year. It's my time to be me and enjoy being me and just savor life for what it is. I saved enough money and I'm quite good with budget. Nevertheless, I want to make the most out of my extra cash without me having to recant from my life goal this year.ÊThanks! I appreciate any insight.Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it's inspiring.
