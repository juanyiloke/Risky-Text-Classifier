Does Glucophage Aid Weight Loss?   About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and was prescribed metformin. My mom bought generic met, which I've been taking for almost a year. Well, i'm not religious in taking my medicines to begin with.Anyway, I was wondrin' why I haven't lost weight when those people I know with diabetes naturally lost weight. I've read that glucophage is prescribed to obese patients with Diabetes to help them lose weight. Is this true at all? If it is, what daily dosage is safe to take?Thanks a lot!
