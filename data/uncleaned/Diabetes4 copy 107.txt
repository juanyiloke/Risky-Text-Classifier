Me again!Crawling out of the woodwork for confession time!    I have not tested for months (and months)! Have gained midriff weight and hate it  Have tested this evening to try and kick start again and truly shocked! 3+ hours after eating a meal with 40G carbs - first test was 18.4! rewashed hands and retested a 16.8!  Have smacked myself hard .....      What I fail to understand is why am I not sleeping all the time like I was before dx - why do I have energy? I certainly don't feel ill like I did before?I have not gone back to cakes, biscuits, rice, pasta, potatoes, pizza etc I do eat battered fish occasionally, hummus and cous cous I plan to test rigorously again and see where I go from here
