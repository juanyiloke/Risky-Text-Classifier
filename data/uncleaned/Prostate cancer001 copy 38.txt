Well,I,ve been diagnosed today..So,I've been diagnosed with prostate cancer,apparently I should be happy it's localised to my prostate,and have been recommended surgery to remove the gland entirely.I,ve no idea quite what the repercussions are,or what to expect after surgery,or even if surgery is the right way to go for me?Basically,I know very little about any of this and am trying to learn quickly.My doctor gave me an mot,about 3 months ago,I had two blood tests which showed raised psi,I then moved onto an mri,that was inconclusive and then a biopsy,the result of which I was given yesterday.Any thoughts,ideas,help,advice,would be great,as I truly understand very little about my current predicament.I,m still working,feel fit as a fiddle,and the shock of finding I had cancer wasn't really a shock at all,I already knew inside,I think your body tells you stuff sometimes,and I,m not really reeling from the news,i,m just in the dark about it,and want help to find a path for myself
