Weird.I'm trying to get support by making this post, as well as "write" it out loud if that makes any sense. I've had an issue with eating for awhile. I have no idea why it started. It could have been because of meds or it could be psychosomatic. I just know that for years now I've not been able to eat a lot of food without feeling like I'm going to get sick. The weird thing is it seems to be selective, like I can eat a lot of certain foods, but not a lot of others. That's what makes me think it's psychosomatic. Anyway it's always been a weird thing about me, but things have gotten different recently. All of a sudden I want to watch my weight. I'm very light as it is and I find myself wanting to lose more. I even have a goal in mind and have been checking my weight a lot. I think I'm doing this partially for control and partially for attention which makes me disgusted with myself. Anyway it's weird that this is happening. It's freaking me out. Anyway thoughts? Thanks for reading this!
