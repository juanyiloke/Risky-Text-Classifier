Back from post op apt.....sigh.....Had a lul on 12/9, home last Friday, doing well. Had another chest X-ray that was ok I guess, got 2 sutures removed, clear to take a shower, wash my hair and DRIVE  I asked my surgical onc what stage my lung cancer is, wish I had not...kind of....but OF COURSE I need to know ..... Its 3A........started probably about a year ago, no symptoms.....eye tumor led to pet to find the lung cancer so for what its worth I am grateful to the director of retinal services at mass eye and ear for saving my life to this point.Surgical onc is setting me up w/medical oncologist who specializes in lung cancer treatment. Just got off the phone with the nurse navigator, she ROCKS!!!! cried my eyes out but it's OK!!!!Med onc apt Monday, radiation onc apt to be madeThanks for listening
