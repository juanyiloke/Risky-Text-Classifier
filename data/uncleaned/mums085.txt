Hi,You may think I'm a bit crazy but well, it's quite possible. A week ago, when DH an I were bathing our 9-days-old DD, she suddenly stretched herself and hit her head on bath. I was so scared... There was no redness, no bruise, she seemed ok, so we didn't call a doctor. However, even after a week I can't find peace of mind. I blame myself for not being careful enough, I blame myself for not insisting on taking her to a doctor and I blame myself for not being a good mother for her. DH is sure that everything is fine with the baby, I keep torturing myself with 'What if there's something not obvious'. Do you think she needs to be seen by a doctor or I'm being paranoiac?
