Best man speech helphi all,Have a best man speech to get ready for weekend after next.ÊHaven't started writing it down yet but have the majority of it in my head so to speak. The opening part is the bit that's bothering me.Have trawled the net but everything sounds so cheesy. Has anyone heard a decent general type opening line at a wedding or should I just play that part straight introducing myself and saying how I know groom etc.?Many thanks for replies in advance
