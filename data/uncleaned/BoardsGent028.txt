Men's MagazinesNot talking about Nuts, Loaded or Playboy.But mags that cover a range of topics. I just bought Esquire, some good articles, some not so good (personal view) but lots and lots of ads.I'll pick up Tatler Man tomorrow, for 2.99 it's very good. Only comes out every quarter though.But generally I think men aren't catered for in the magazine area unlike women. So do you have any recommendations for good, varied reading material?
