ÊMy day so farÊso I wake up at my ex boyfriends house. We spent the night together, we just stretched and worked out, watched a movie, had sex and fell asleep. We've been broken up for two years and were together for three. Anyways I woke up and left almost immediately cause I know he doesn't want me there. I came home and made and bun with tomato. Then I decided to go to the brunch Buffett by my house alone. I cleared three plates of food, most of which wasn't vegan. The waiter wasn't bringing me enough water for me to puke it up comfortably in the restaurant bathroom.I still feel gross tho like I need to run or something. Anyways that's all, I guess that's just my day so far. I have a lot of studying to do today before I go back to work tomorrow. Today is my only day off. Ugh , why am I like this.
