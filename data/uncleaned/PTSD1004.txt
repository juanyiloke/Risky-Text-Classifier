I have had P.T.S.D from a very young age. Throughout my life ive had crazy and disturbing dreams. Disturbing to the point were i feel i cannot repeat them to another living soul let alone myself again. The dream i had the other night was of my dog who i love dearly. Someone was walking my dog with a bunch of other dogs and when they came back the person had like walked him to death almost. His hair was thin and was a lighter color and he had bald spots everywere. But the part thst gets me is his tail looked all matted so i tried to untangle it and i eventualy got the hair to split so i could see, and his tail was all decayed with the bone popping out. He was still happy to see me. I think i had this dream because in real life I'm affraid of leaving my dog in the wrong hands because i couldn't bare it if he got hurt. Since that dream I've been feeling emotionaly drained an nauseous. The thing is during the day if i sit down and get comfortable i will fall asleep. And i sleep so peacefuly. I look forward to cat naps rather than a nights sleep.
