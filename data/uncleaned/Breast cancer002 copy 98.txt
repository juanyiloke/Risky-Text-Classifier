Appointment at breast clinic this afternoon...¥	Hello - ¥	I found a lump in my armpit on Sunday, went to the doctors Monday and was referred to the breast clinic and received a phone call this morning asking me to go in this afternoon. I am 25 and feeling quite sick now. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43. I'm trying to keep positive and tell myself I'm sure it's nothing but I also feel like I need to prepare myself incase I hear news that everything isn't ok.¥	I don't really know what to expect at the breast clinic? I've read up on it but still feel extremely anxious... ¥	What happened with your appointment? How long did it last? Did they tell you there and then the results? ¥	Xx
