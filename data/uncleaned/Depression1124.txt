Self harm and DepressionOk So I cant mention self harm but would like to say it does go hand in hand with certain forms of depression. This can mean putting yourself in dangerous situations, physically hurting yourself, abusing drugs, becoming reclusive, associating with the 'Wrong type' of people.I have done them all but would like to hear from anyone who has had success in suppressing these urges. Strategies, own stories, Anything even a good recipe for scones. The only tricks I have learned so far are laughing at 'It' or compartmentalising it....
