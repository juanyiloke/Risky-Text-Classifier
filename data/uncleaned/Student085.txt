Want to Drop out of Uni!by ped4lHi,I am currently at uni and and I want to drop out and have done since the 1st semester. Basically my accomodation is quite expensive and the only reason I haven't dropped out is because I use my student loan to pay for my accommodation. I was just wondering, when it comes to 3rd semester, and I get my last instalment of student finance, would I be able to pay the remainder of my accommodation off and drop out of uni? After paying my accommodation There would be around £800 spare from my loan. Thanks for reading
