My DS is in reception and extremely shy. There have been lots of parties since September - he has been invited to very few. So I have spent a stupid amount of his party, to try and raise his profile a bit and make friends (he is very worried about his very small number of friends at school). We have a small flat, so church hall booked, veeeeeery expensive entertainer....twenty invites given out three weeks ago. Four acceptances. Party in two days. I feel dreadful, for him - he was so happy handing out the invites. (Completely appreciate that the holidays must have interfered with peoples lives, but can they at least respond to say no?). I just really hope the five of them have a nice party, don't want to think about the per head cost, haha! Is it common for people not to respond at all to invites here? We had the same thing at his nursery too, but better turn out in the end but 8 out of 20 didn't even reply then too. We live in London, by the way.
