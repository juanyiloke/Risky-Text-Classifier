Well I Am Officially Homeless And Living In Motels.My daughter is being evicted from her home and I am being sued as a resident. So I told my daughter that I had to move out. Got a po box address and using my friends address to get said po box.Living in motels. Thank God for wi fi. I am trying to keep busy.I had given up on looking at apartments and sure enough I found one today. It is a three bedroom and two baths and it is in a town I do not like but I have my hopes high because the managers said I have a good chance of getting it. The catch is that I have to wait three weeks for it to be refurbished. I am very lucky that I can stay in motels for now.A good friend told me if I had to live on the streets she would take me in.Things are tense between my daughter and me now. I had the movers move my stuff into storage the next day.I miss my family so much and my daughter told me that she was going to move far away.So I am trying to make the best of things.I sure hope I get the apartment and I can start over and rebuild my life.I do not know if I can afford to rent a motel room for three weeks so i may have to take my friend on her offer.
