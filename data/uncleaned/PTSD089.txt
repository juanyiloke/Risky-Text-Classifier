Personal Accountability And Self CareI'm just wondering what some other people's opinions on this might be:I find that personal accountability is big for me, in my own life and for those around me. I've had so many people who would never do a thing they promised whether it was a big deal or something inconsequential. So it's become important to me to find people who are reliable to surround myself with, and to hold myself to a high standard when it comes to doing what I say I will.The problem becomes those times when I can't. I try to (when I KNOW I'm going to be symptomatic) phrase things in a manner that allows for multiple outcomes rather than promising things, or to ask for help/make a compromise from the beginning. But inevitably I will have times where I have stated I will do something and by the time that day or that hour rolls around I am unable to do it and still be okay. By way of example, I was supposed to get my car serviced today. But I had a long talk with a good friend last night that involved a lot of disclosure around a trauma that's difficult for me to talk about, and I haven't gotten particularly good sleep in a couple days. I got myself to the service center but just wasn't able to park and go in, felt physically ill at the idea.This has been floating around in my head for a while. Basically, how do you balance between keeping your word and being true to what you end up needing in the moment? When is a symptom spike just an excuse and when is it valid/important to honor that you aren't functioning at a high enough level? Does having our symptoms and episodes mean we can't be reliable trustworthy and responsible individuals? Sometimes it feels that way.
