Going through a tough time at the moment I had a really great 6 months between March and September this year with no oral steroids or antibiotics. I since mid September when weather started to change I have been wheeze and had a dry cough was told to double my seretide from 500x 2 to 1000x2 when this didn't work I returned to my doctors and was prescribed oral steroids went back 5 days later and was told there was nothing else go could do so was referring my to hospital. That was a week ago have not heard anything and have still gone further down hill with decreasing pf now below 300 usually 450. Returned to the doctors today to be given a flu jab and told I'm still quite wheeze now been given 5 days more pred at 40 mg daily and antibiotics and told to come back Monday to check progress. I'm just feeling frustrated as I'm a teacher and really feel I can't do my job properly at the moment it's getting me downEmmaleigh.
