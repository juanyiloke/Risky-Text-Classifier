How Can I Help My Good Friend?Ê  GoldenEve ,Ê20 Apr 2015HiÊfolks,ÊI have a good friend whoðs suffering badly from arthritis, he had 2 years ago a surgery for his hips.Ê Heðs on heavy medication for his pain but still found that itðs hard to cope.Ê He started drinking a lot lately which is a concern because with the type of medication that his taking itðs really not recommended.Ê He told me that he drink to ease the pain his medication isn't enough and also that he doesnðt care about living anymore in such pain day after day and that he strongly wish that he would drink until he wouldnðt wake up.Ê Iðm really concern about him; Rock thatðs his name always was so mentally strong and was able to go through anything that life threw at him.Ê I know that he suffers a great deal and that if I was in his shoes I would probably drink myself silly as well to end the pain butð I donðt know how to help him and how to help him, last night over the phone he told me that he wishes that God will come and take him away.Ê I donðt think that he would commit suicide but talking to him on the phone last night was brutal and scary.Ê Rock was always there for me in my hard time and I want to be there for him as well.ÊÊ How can you help someone who's physically suffering and idolize suicide to end the pain?
