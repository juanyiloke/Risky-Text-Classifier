3 QuestionsPlease tell me if there are terms or statutes that apply to these things. I do not really want a blanket term like "harassment".1. Basically being forced to listen to someone talk. Not exactly verbal abuse. But for instance if someone is forcing you against your will in general, to just listen to him talk about himself endlessly. Almost in the sense of verbal abuse just being endless talking that you have no interest in hearing.2. Copy-catting. Is there a legal term or a specific statute (in any state really) that applies to copying crimes that were in movies or other crimes. I know that hate crime can include committing a crime because of knowledge of a crime against a specific person. Does that extend to committing crimes because you have awareness of any crime that's committed. Like a person who would copy Jack the Ripper's crimes. 3. I know that there is a element of estimating damages called dependence which means that the victim felt they could not report due to the actions of supervisors. Ok, what if there is a huge conspiracy that is essentially completely illogical that creates an environment so hostile and distorted anyone will feel entitled to act like a psycho. For example, a person who is on disablity who lives in section 8 housing who is a drunk or junkie who has been a loser his entire life, acting as if he is macho, just because some loser told him that he could. But it goes to the point that it's basically terrorism. That it's just ridiculous, because all parties are really aware that that person is not crazy or confident enough to really do that and in reality he is only acting. Essentially it would be like creating a bubble that only exists around one person. Anywhere outside of the bubble it is nonsense, but within the bubble it is law.
