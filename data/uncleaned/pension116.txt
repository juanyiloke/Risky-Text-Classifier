Lonliness and IsolationHi all,ÊI am currently studying 3D design and I am researching lonliness and isolation in the elderly, why this is and ways in which this can be reduced. Since people are living a lot longer I think that this is an area that really needs to be discussed and something that needs to be improved on. With the technological advances, I think that there must be a way in which this can be tackled. Please could you write honestly and openly about why you think loneliness and isolation occurs and how it could potentially be prevented.ÊThanks,ÊCathy
