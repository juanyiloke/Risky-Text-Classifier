Suffer from PTSDPosted 4 months agoHi, I'm new to this but think it will be another tool for me to cope. Maybe help someone else as well?I'm 43 years old and suffer from anxiety, depression and mood swings.Lately I have been on an emotional roller coaster that's destructive to all that I love.  I feel no one understands me and I'm always the bad guy. My employer think I'm nuts and are in the process of moving me to a quiter less active Fire Station.  I have been a Lead Firefighter for 17 years and during Emergencies that's when I'm at my best.  My symptoms go away.Its the BS of being a part of Emergency Services that really amps me up.  Politics, I live half of my career at work with several different personalities mostly Type A's. The other half at home with my wife and 16year old son. I am a U.S. MARINE served active duty from 1990-1993. Was deployed to Kuwait via Saudi Arabia in December of 1990.  When I came back i didn't know I brought something back also. I self medicated with alcohol for many years until December 9th 2010. I just stopped and took Zanax prescribed by the VA.  They switched me to Lorazepam about 3 years ago.  I have demons that I battle with everyday in my head. My wife says I get in my little world and shut everyone out. Well thanks for listening
