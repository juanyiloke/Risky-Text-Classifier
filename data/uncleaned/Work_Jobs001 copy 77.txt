Overpaid by Previous Part Time Employer________________________________________Hi,I took a part time job to supplement my income last summer. It was bar work and 5 hours per week. Sometimes they paid me by cheque and sometimes into my bank account. I left the job on the 7th December on friendly terms. I got a call tonight from one of the owners stating that they had double paid me on some weekends and now they want the money recouped. They are stating its nearly Û600 but I have just looked through my account and although i have discovered they have overpaid me, its more to the tune of Û250. I had no idea this was happening at the time since it was over several months and has come to be a complete shock to me. Are they entitled to the full amount back etc, any advice much appreciated
