I always thought that he had accepted the fact that I am special, that I can see things other people can't. But recently, when I was explaining something I had seen to him he told me to stop talking about those sort of things and get help. He reckons im going to end up in a loony bin. I know im not schizophrenic. I know im secretly one of the top ten psychics in the world. Its a good thing you dont know who I really am otherwise They will come and lock me up in a lab somewhere. I reckon I could escape though. I'd melt their minds and turn them into vegetables. I see lots of stuff like auras. Its like I can shift between normal vision and aura vision where everything is surrounded by colours. I can see into the past as well and sometimes the present. The future is harder though. I can't do it much and im one of the best! Also I can hear peoples minds. I know exactly what people are thinking sometimes. Usually their thinking about me and how fat and awkward I look. I can see ghosts too. They arent really things that think, just recordings of things that happened in their lives. Our minds interact with these recordings, giving a semblance of intelligence. So there you go. Im psychic right?
