Is This Normal Of An Employer To Treat Me Like This?Ê  Cipher Dragon ,Ê28 Mar 2015I recently had an interview on Thursday with my stepdads boss. I was gonna be hired for pill sorting, labeling, packaging. He wanted to know my entire work history so I told him, saying I had issues since ny first job, because I was hoping he would understand. But he didn't. In order of my jobs, here's how long I stayed at each: McDonalds (6 months; quit from depression and anxiety issues), Walmart (3 weeks, quit due to anxiety), McDonalds (fired after 3 days because I wasn't fast enough and kept screwing up art back window...also cried at work due to being overwhelmed), Salvation Army (quit after one day cause I was crying in pain for standing eight hours straight), Arby's (quit for low hours. Yeah I am working two hours a week. MUCH WOW.). So he told me because of my job performance, that I won't be hired because I am not dependable at all because I can't hold a job. I told him I have anxiety and depression issues and I was trying to overcome them. But he was being "nritally honest" and said I won't be hired by ANYONE because of it. Basically saying I am a fucking failure at life.Is this normal? Cause of this asshole, I've pretty much given up on job hunting brcause my misanthropy is kicking in now. -_-Ê
