Men & STI testing...Just wondering is it just me or is this something that is rarely if ever done regularly by Irish men? I've never been tested but would maybe like to get it done just for peace of mind. I've always used condoms when engaging in sexual activity but still would like to be tested for peace of mind if nothing else. I know women I've spoken to about this subject who told me that they get tested once a year or maybe once every 2 years, (they have said that they usually get this done as part of a smear test), whereas for us guys, maybe because it isn't part of a broader set of health checks, as it can be for women for women, I mean that for us guys, it is going specifically for an STI test and maybe it is harder to attend for that reason. I've done a bit of Googling on the subject this morning and am surprised to find that fairly basic information such as the testing procedure and the cost of same, isn't really available on the sites I found myself reading.ÊOne of my male friends got tested and while he got the all clear, he mentioned that the test procedure was fairly painful. I checked here on the forum as I thought there was a thread on this that was stickied but it appears that there isn't one so I thought I'd start a thread on the subject for a serious and informative discussion on the subject...
