Does it ever get better?I am a 24 year old female. I have been bulimic since the 8th grade. Roughly around 13 years old. I remember the moment, in vivid, that I started. I was a cheerleader and was so excited! We got our uniforms in and a friend of mine made a comment about how I had the biggest size. That was it. I remember the first time I purged. I had eaten a little debbie snack and I felt so guilty. I don't know why or how the thought of purging came to mind, but it did and I threw up that delicious, childlike snack. It has been down hill since then. Sometimes I can go a few days without purging. Usually because I am with my boyfriend, who knows about my disorder but does not fully understand it. He has been supportive, but I don't think he understands the depth of what bulimia is. Some days I go to several fast food places and sit in my car eating and eating until I am sick. I live with my family, who know my struggle, but I don't think they would ever bring it up. Recently I have started doing drugs. I know this is a terrible alternative, but it keeps me from a binge. I am at a point that I may lose my job because I have missed so many days due to not having enough energy or because I have done drugs and kept myself up all night. I have been to doctors and I am currently prescribed an anti depressant, but I feel myself slipping away. I weighed myself recently and was shocked at what I saw. I can't even describe the feeling. I had to try and compose myself at the doctors office. I don't know how to get over this and I am so overwhelmed that some days it seems almost impossible to keep going. I just need some support and I guess advice.
