 My Experience with AnxietyAs I'm new to the site I thought I'd discuss my experiences with anxiety and my coping methods. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder about 12 months ago now. Personally, I feel I should've been to the doctor sooner but I found it difficult. It was quite frustrating before I went to the doctor as close relatives and family assumed I was just shy; which I could understand from their point of view as it is difficult to diagnose anxiety especially at a young age. My first experiences where I felt anxious started when I was at high school with a feeling of unease around my peers, loss of friends mid-way through school and difficulty mixing with people. I find it difficult to interact with others and my poor communications skills gradually got worse from this point and contributed to my anxiety.I found starting work was difficult; in an office environment around new people and needing to communicate with them. My anxiety spiralled at work and this was when I decided to get support. Currently, my anxiety is affecting my work with me making mistakes , having difficulties concentrating as I'm worrying and thinking about my anxiety most of the time. Its quite uncomfortable and daunting for me at work as colleagues don't know why I'm making basic mistakes and seem so quiet and withdrawn.I've had a few CBT therapy sessions and I'm now taking citalopram tablets to help to control my anxiety.I'd recommend taking medication to anyone who is suffering with anxiety as it has helped me to stay calm.I promise to post shorter messages in the future; as it is only my first few posts I thought it would be helpful to explain my experience with anxiety and coping methods which hopefully will help others
