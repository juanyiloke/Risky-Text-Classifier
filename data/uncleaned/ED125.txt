Residential at Tapestry in North Carolina.Hi everyone,I am suffering from anorexia. I've been in residential programs before but none quite like what Tapestry offers...it's just the closest one to my current home situation and my insurance covers it. Mirasol is another option but far away. I was wondering if anyone here had been to either and could give me some feedback on the programs...I am scared to commit to six weeks, esp. because I have other health issues that complicate the ED and I might end up needing a different level of care, and I don't want to be responsible for the minimum six weeks' payment if I have to leave or if the program is not getting me better/making me worse...I have read reviews and they are SO mixed and it's making me nervous...Is there anyone here that has any experience with these facilities?
