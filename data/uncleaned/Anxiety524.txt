MENTALLY and physical not there... PLZ HELPSo i need to express again i am sorry i tried to control myself from not writing but it makes me feel lightOkay so i don’t know i feel really off, like its kind of hard to explain like, i feel as though i am content with way i am at times which is good, but then i feel as though i feel this way because i feel almost emotionless.Like before when i was asked to something by parents i would say no that my regular attitude i am lazy, but now i do whatever they say like i am a robot for some reason. Like i feel as though i am moving far away from the me i used to be f. It scares me i don’t feel like myself, like i am confused at times, i aimlessly wander, feel like i have no thoughts can’t think properly, like i have a mental confusion, at times i feel like i have no energy so tired, and i have loss of appetite. Its just weird, i feel like time is going by fast and i don’t know what to do i am so confused. Like my memory is ridiculously horrible too, i can’t keep a thought in my head i keep forgetting every thought. I feel as though i have no aim in life. I don’t know these feelings have got me tripped out, i feel kind of happy, but that scares because in this type of situation i should feel frustrated that why i am feel this way.like i do feel anxious like a sense of doom larks on me. i feel like i have deadly disease waiting for me. Like yesterday i woke at 3am really thirsty and right after i drank my water, i felt as though my heart will my stop right now and those thoughts stayed in my head till i feel asleep again. My heads fixed that i will die of a serious heart disease or liver failure like i am on high alert.PLZ HELP!!!also i have this weird feeling of whenever i see or do something i feel like this feel be the last time i see them or do this thing. Its freaking me out.
