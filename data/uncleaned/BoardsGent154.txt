Do you eat properly?Are you conscious of what you eat and don't eat? Do you make the effort to eat three meals a day with moderate portions? Do you endeavour to eat your '5 a day' and drink lots of water?I've noticed recently that I do have a lot of digestive discomfort. I know I could eat better but I think my now 30ish year old tummy still thinks it can guzzle the same amount of food as it did when it was in its teens.I find these days I get bloated and extreme discomfort a lot. At one stage I thought it was the usual case of too much bread, or too much dairy product. But I think its more down to portion control (or lack of) and not eating my 3 meals at the same times each day. I've a tendency to over eat at times which leaves me feeling just awful. It often affects my concentration, energy levels and can make me quite irritable. However, when I do lower my portions and eat regularly it makes the difference.I am sure I am not the only guy that really doesn't pay enough attention to what/when/how I eat. I'd love to know if any of the other guys especially have had to change their eating habits for the better in recent times?If so, what do you normally eat for the 3 meals and do you consider your portion size?
