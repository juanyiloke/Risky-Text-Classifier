Êforgetting who 'me' isHello allDeclaring today as a 'stay in bed' day which Is the right thing for me right now, and hubby and sons are absolutely fine with that. But am just feeling a great loss about the old me and I can't see I'll ever be that person again. I used to be care-free and genuinely happy.... but those days seem like a long time ago now.My CPN and trauma therapist say that they believe I will become well again and I can recover from my PTSD but three and half years seems like a long time ago when I was consistently well. No flashbacks, no nightmares, no feeling different to everyone around me. I changed CPNs a few months ago as the new one can provide long tern support so I know I am lucky to have this, I really do. But life is just different. I am a recluse at work where I don't come out of my own office, I cant go to the village shops, I can't face busy parents evening in three weeks tine at a large secondary school for my son (so might have to email teachers instead), just want to hide away:-( Trapped in my head. Am finding it very hard to see any sense if normality ahead of me.Does anyone else struggle with the sense of losing their old selves?Ê
