Thank YouAlthough this is my first post, I have been a lurker here since my diagnosis almost 3 years ago with lung cancer stage 4. I have shied away from all information on the internet and put my trust in my wonderful Doctors. I received all the usual treatment and drugs, chemotherapy and radiation. But one thing that kept me going was reading some of the inspirational stories on this site, particularly when I was feeling down.Reading some of the stories gave me a real boost when I was low and this note is really to say thank you to all of you.I’ve still got the cancer and I live with it stoically. It is part of me and I accept it. From an initial diagnosis of 6 months, its now 3 years and counting. I stopped taking any medication about 5 months ago and feel tired but well. That’s probably enough for a first post and again Thank you
