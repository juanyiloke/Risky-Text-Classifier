  Every Little ThingvMy family does not include me in their Thanksgivings, or remember me in particular on that day or any holiday. My friends are usually all busy with their family or more important friends on that day, and this Thanksgiving was no different. My neighbors have their own lives. I don't expect or really even hope to be included any longer since over time I have come to terms with how holidays  are not a time I am a part  of anybody's life . It still feels bad to be isolated or excluded. I made some great  turkey day food this year including dessert. I found someone else who doesn't have a family that cares, and doesn't have a big fancy life or friends who care that way. I loaded up a manly portion of all the holiday foods and a nice big dessert portion too, and dropped it off to him at his work all piping hot on Thanksgiving day. I ate my meal in the silence of my 2 rooms, went to bed. When I got my dishes back on Saturday I found that my actions had created a wholeness and a warmth for someone who had not felt that way before I brought the gift of food, which was really the gift of caring. I can't fix how my family treats me but that doesn't mean I can't help others make the most of the day. It is not what the action  is that is so important sometimes, it is what we really mean in the actions we take, in every little thing we do.
