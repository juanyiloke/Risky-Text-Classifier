Today, I'm sick of being a mam. I feel like I want to throw in the towel.ÊI've had endless tantrums from DD1, DD2 will not stop screaming to be picked up.I feel like a shit mam, I know I love my babies so much, but I have no 'get up and go' anymore. I don't want to play playdoh, I don't want to coo and smile cheerily. I want to sit in a room, by myself and cry. Deep down I know I'd do anything for them but I can't muster any form of strength to actively be a good mam, a fun mam who smiles and tickles them and sings songs.ÊI don't usually feel this down, it's gradually getting worse though, I don't know how to get out. Has anybody got any tips on how I can be the parent I want to be.Ê
