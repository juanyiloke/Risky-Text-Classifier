Seroma¥	Hi all I am almost 4 weeks post mx and DIEP reconstruction. I have a lot of necrotic skin which I am having surgery to remove next week but is it usual to still keep getting a boob full of fluid. I have had it drained twice and the last time they drained off 6 large syringe full but by the evening it was back again. It is so painful and also getting lots of pain the middle of my chest, like someone is sitting on it. Any advice would be most welcome as my plastics nurse does not seem too bothered but it is making me feel so ill and so low and I was recovering really well¥	Thank you
