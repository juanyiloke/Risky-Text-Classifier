salmetorol (serevent)alone________________________________________Glad I found this forum.I have a question which I hope to find answer from members of this forum.My question is if there is any member who are better off with salmetorol (serevent) monotherapy instead of combination therapy with steroid fluticasone (I.e. Advair) .The question is prompted by my mother's experience. She was on Advair(equivalent) for about 10 years but asthma flared up for past 2 months and none or most of other additional therapies were working.On my own initiative i switched to serevent (50 ug twice a day)from advair 250/50 once a day.Twice a day of advair was making it worse and hence my trial with salmeterol monotherapy.She is doing well for a week on salmeterol (serevent) monotherapy.Fingers crossed .Greatly appreciate responses from members who are on long term therapy with serevent and found better results compared to advair .Thanks in advance
