Providing Emotional Support to OthersSo yeah, just wondering how everyone feels they're at it?Are there any people who expect some level of emotional support from you in their lives? Why do you think they chose you?What kind of things do you do to help? (e.g. do you talk specifically about whatever's on their mind, give them a respite from it by doing something to help distract them, etc...)Do you find it hard to engage in such things?ÊHave you ever been complimented or criticised for you efforts or lack thereof? (e.g. maybe your approach has received a negative response despite totally good intentions, what in particular was criticised in that case)Not sure if it's just that I come from a farming background or it's more general, but most the men in my extended family tend to not expect any kind of emotional support and are pretty critical of any kind of problems people have which aren't purely physical, I'd never expect anything but abuse if I opened up to any of them.I think I'm mostly pretty good at, I've received compliments for my efforts from a bunch of people over the years at least. A lot of the time it involves me picking up on something being wrong rather than someone outright approaching me to talk about a problem so I don't know how people feel about me in that respect overall.Regarding negatives, I'm not a very openly affectionate person or anything like that, so even when I know a person needs a hug or whatever, any attempt to do so will be pretty awkward. I've also been told that, while I usually have good contributions to make and suggestions for actions to take, I'm overly pragmatic in the moment.
