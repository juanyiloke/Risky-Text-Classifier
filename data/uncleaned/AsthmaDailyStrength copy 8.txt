Hi All! My name is Chloe and I am currently studying toward a BSc degree in Digital Media at Portsmouth University. For my Dissertation, I am looking at the effectiveness of printed information given to Asthma sufferers as I have noticed that all of the printed information that has been given to me during visits to the GP and hospital have been quite out-dated when it comes to design and the information displayed on it. I was wondering whether anyone else had recently received any information either from a doctor, hospital, pharmacist etc. and what your thoughts were on the design and the information it features. Did you feel it was relevant to you as an individual? Do you feel it could be improved? Any views would be a great help to me and my research! Many thanks!
