  I know people hate the idea of therapy but...Therapy helped me, i know it sounds scary and can confirm that you do indeed need help. I refused any help and began self harming and having self destructive thoughts and it wasn't until one of my friends accidentally saw some of my scars that i realised that i shouldn't be doing this. I confided in her and basically told her everything, from the messy break up to the serious problems i was having with my family.She spoke to the school councillor and at first i resented her and was convinced it wouldn't help. I went to the first session and it turned out to go quite well. The councillor never pressured me into talking and sometimes i would spent a few minutes silently thinking of how to put things and he never pried. He did teach me one thing that sounds stupid but it does work. Writing one good thing about yourself a day and putting it somewhere you'll see it. I also wrote all my problems down and burnt them (safely i might add!) it was weirdly uplifting. Don't know why i felt like sharing this today but my councillor just called to check i was okay. I left the school 2 years ago and they still check up on me from time to time and are happy to listen to my dramatics.I hope you all are encouraged to atleast reach out by this message. I know people say it a lot but it DOES get better, for 4 years i refused to believe it but it does. Feel free to message me if you need anything or an unbiased opinion.Much loveKayleighBxox
