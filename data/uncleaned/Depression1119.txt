Many years of depression, but it does not rule meI have suffered depression for many years (8yrs). I have been to the lowest point you can go and have come back from it. I view my illness now as the equivalent of diabetes Êthere is no cure, but I have learned to live and manage it. ÊIt does not rule me ÊI rule it. ÊThe thoughts are just that. ÊIt had taken me many year and countless hours of treatment and a few hospital admission to come to this conclusion, finally I have. ÊThere is hope and light at the end of the tunnel. ÊI hope someone reads this that has no hope, but believe me there is. ÊI tried to harm myself Êthank god I did not take. I am now working On myself every day and believe there is a better world out there. My goal in life now is to help people in need and to explains experience. ÊLife is worth living and enjoying
