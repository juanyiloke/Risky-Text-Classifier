Eye Screening ResultsI returned home today to find an ominous looking letter waiting for me from the hospital. Given that my first eye screening last year showed background changes I was extremely agitated about this second screening and honestly given that my eyes were badly affected throughout I was expecting the worst. Even more so when the letter arrived four days after the screening. I was shaking like a leaf when I opened it. Well tickle me with a big feather it's only ruddy NORMAL. I am so unbelievably chuffed I can't express it properly. This is quite honestly the first bit of good news I've had health wise in the last year. Maybe there's hope for this useless bag of bones yet
