ÊHow do you experience flashbacks?I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, so for this reason I do not even know if this is valid or not.But I've always been curious how people with PTSD experience their flashbacks? I get 'flashbacks', as in, random flashes of images from certain 'traumatic' scenarios and sometimes a prolonged replaying of the event inside my head to the point where I can't sleep because it won't stop.I put those specific words in inverted commas because idek if they are truly flashbacks or if the events were truly traumatic.But I've heard that some people when they get flashbacks almost hallucinate in the sense that what they see, hear and smell is all part of a memory that they wish they could forget. But mine aren't as severe as that, and idk if it HAS to be that severe for it to be full blown PTSD.I'd just like some insight really. If you want to know what I get flashbacks of most, then I'm happy to say, if it well help.Ê
