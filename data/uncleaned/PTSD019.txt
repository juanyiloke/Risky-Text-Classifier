Complex Ptsd & Ptsd Are The Loneliest ConditionPTSDÊis a cruel heartless condition!!!ÊJust said "goodbye" to my son who has been deployed to Canada until Christmas. "What has this to do with PTSD?" you might ask. How many people can say "they feel nothing, and I mean nothing, saying goodbye to a person who you know you should be feeling love for".ÊMy head is so full of thoughts and images I have no room for the present. One by one I have ruined every relationship I have had in the last 25years. Bit by bit I isolate myself a little more every day.ÊI have a family, I am just so disconnected from them, it is like sitting in a room full of strangers. I had friends, who just simply do not understand. How can I expect others to understand when I don't understand it myself. Even to do the simplest of tasks, takes me all day to plan it. Night after night of not sleeping. Trying to put my mind in the present and the past has such a powerful force it's like im looking onto the present from outside of me. I don't even know who me is anymore. My life has no resemblance to my former life. My former life had small children, laughter, hobbies goals and dreams. Now it feels like only the past has space in my head.ÊEvery week for the last two months I have seen my therapist, and every week when she asks me what i'm feeling I lie to her, making up a feeling just so I don't look even more crazy!!!I don't feel anything. PTSD steals lives not only from one person, but from whole families. It creates a void so large nothing can fill it.ÊSorry if this seems a miserable post, maybe im just not having a good day, this day feels like all the other days. At least here I can write, and read your threads that are inspiring, that helps keep me in the present for a few mins. Take care all x
