Could I have early stages of Schizophrenia?Hi, my names Jason and i only started feeling like this a week ago. I went to the doctors and he said I probably just have anxiety. I have no inhibitions to do anything but lay in bed, I don't feel like going outside, I'm not depressed but I just feel emotionless and don't want to do anything. I have a stupid stare going on and it's really annoying. I have an Intense fear of becoming a Schizophrenic, my uncle has bipolar and I think Schizophrenia too..every time I want to go outside and do something I'll think it's stupid and just stay inside.. Today I've thought of killing myself and I'm getting fairly paranoid, I keep listening for voices and when i close my eyes to sleep I'll have random closed eye delusions but when i open my eyes i know they weren't real and stupid. But I'm still scared as. Does anyone have any thoughts as to if i might be developing Schizophrenia, I would appreciate it.Thanks
