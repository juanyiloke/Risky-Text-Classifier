Silly Lungs! Just feel like a bit of a moanHad a GREAT day out walking with my club - 6 miles round Snowdonia (NOT going up Snowdon!!). We had lovely weather, we took it at a gentle pace with plenty of stops to admire views etc.On the way home my lungs had to put a slight dampener on the day!! For some reason if i fall asleep on the coach i often wake up coughing and needing my inhaler (wish i could understand why, can only think it must be due to the air con) but tonight it decided not to settle straight away. I took my normal 2 puffs and thought all would be fine but i still struggled, ended up taking another 2 puffs about half an hour later which thankfully did settle the cough.
