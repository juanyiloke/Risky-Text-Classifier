Small age gap help, tips and advice.Hi all, I'm nearly 40weeks pg with baby number 3, I also have a 12month old and a 6 year old son.ÊMy eldest is fine and extremely excited about the new arrival, however my 1 year old obviously doesn't understand, she is extremely clingy with me, her dad and brother.ÊAlthough on the go constantly I'm worried about how the new baby will affect her, i never had to worry about such a small age gap before.ÊHow do I stop her getting jealous and maybe trying to hurt baby?ÊMy mum has made remarks about her possibly becoming spiteful and trying to hurt the newborn. I don't want this and the comments upset me, least with my son I could involve him more by helping me.ÊCan anyone with an age gap so small tell me what they did, or did it just flow and nothing to worry about.ÊI plan on trying to use the baby carrier as much as I can so I have my hands free and so on.ÊI need tips. I'm so happy and excited too just it's in the back of my mind
