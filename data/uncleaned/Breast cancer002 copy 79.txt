Worried about Taxol. On FEC atm¥	Hi All.¥	Im a worrier! Lol ¥	I started my FEC ( 3 x FEC and 3 TAX then the rest) on 2nd April 2015. So I'm day 15 post first FEC. ¥	I haven't been too bad on the FEC. No sickness, v little nausea but bad panic attacks ( I've had these all my life). I'm just really worried about the Docetaxol side effects. I've heard they cause a lot of pain. I have a 6yr old little girl and am worried how it'll effect her seeing me in pain. I'm allergic to Ibuprofen too so don't know how that will effect treatment.¥	Is there anyone else worrying about it or having it at the minute who can shed some light or give tips on how to deal with it? Also if there are any other s/e's other than joint pain? ¥	I like to know what I'm going to be dealing with in advance so I can prepare myself :-) ¥	Thanks for any replies. ¥	God bless x¥	Karin
