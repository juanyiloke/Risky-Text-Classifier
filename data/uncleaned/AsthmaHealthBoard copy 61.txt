Overreacting or real symptoms?________________________________________First off I've lived with these symptoms my entire life so I've gotten used to them and accepted them as my normal. But I am curious if these are asthma symptoms or not. -after running I get coughing attacks and my lungs feel wierd the rest of the day(happens about 75% of the time so in assuming there's a trigger besides just exercise, indoor exercise like martial arts I'm fine with 95% of the time)-when I have a cold it goes straight to my chest, no matter how mild of a cold I'm out do breath walking 10 ft to the fridge -normally I can tell of I'm about to get sick Because my lungs feel tickly the day before I get the rest of the cold symptoms -coughing attacks if temp goes below 60, thank goodness I live in southern caCould this really be asthma? I don't think my dr is willing to test me any further, and I have dealt with it this long so it can't be too serious(I'm 22)
