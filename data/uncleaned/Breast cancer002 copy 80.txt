New Clinical Trial¥	Hi ladies¥	I have been invited to take part in an early screening (blood test) to determine whether I'm suitable to be part of a clinical study of a new medicine for metastatic breast cancer. It's for ladies who test positive with the Brca 1/2 mutations. Hence the pre -screening blood tests.¥	The study is - OlympiAD - Olaparib monotherapy versus Physicians Choice Chemotherapy.¥	It's a very small study. Approximately 12 people from the UK will take part. 310 worldwide.¥	I'm currently just coming to the end of my first cycle of weekly taxol and avastin. I was originally diagnosed in July 2013. Told I was now TNBC with lung mets last month.¥	I have two daughters, so I think we have already decided to go ahead with the initial screening to determine if I carry the Brca genes - so that they are then in a position to make an informed choice - if they have to.¥	If I am positive - I then need to make a decision on whether to join this trial or not. Just wondering if anyone has any input to help me?¥	Thank you¥	xxx¥	(I have posted this in the Triple Negative Group too)
