I've hit a wall (metaphorically)I'm hoping someone who reads this will have been in a similar position and can offer some advice... I'm currently working my butt off not to relapse and restrict, this is probably a record since I developed my ED, but the more I fight it, the worse my depression+anxiety become and the more unstable I feel. I'm so used to the restrict/refeed cycle I am really struggling. I don't have a lot of well established coping mechanisms though and I've begun self-medicating and scalding myself, the latter I've never done before. All just to avoid an ED (and cutting) relapse. It's not working though and I'm noticing my intake is slowly dropping, not loads but enough for me to be impaired physically. I am desperate to find some light, it feels like everyday is the same or worse right now, so any suggestions/ways to cope would be so so appreciated. I've only just started with a new therapist, and get 10 sessions only, so that's not useful as yet.
