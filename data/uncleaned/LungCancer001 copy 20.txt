Newly diagnosedGood MorningI am a 59 year old woman who was just diagnosed on November 18 with small cell lung ca. They removed my lower rt lobe on the 18th and pathology showed that one lymp closest to tumor was positive. My first appointment with the oncologist is this coming Monday and I have NEVER been so scared in my life. I have a great support system of close family and friends but I still feel so alone. Does this get easier? The more I read on line the more terrified I become, I hope joining this forum helps me in dealing with this. I know talking with others that have been or are on t his journey has to help! All my life I have been strong in control and now it seems that I am on this emotional rollercoaster and totally out of control. That felt a bit better to just say that, thanks for any advise that you may have!
