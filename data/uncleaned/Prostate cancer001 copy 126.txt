Radium-223 treatmentHas anyone experience of Radium-223 treatment.I have had Abiraterone from May 5th, 2013. After an initial fall, in the last few months my PSA has been steadily rising by a factor of about 1.4 (although I think that the rate of acceleration is now rising) each month. It is now 123. My consultant has just stope my Abiraterone.In early May I expected to go onto Cabazitaxel, but my consultant referred me to Southampton who are just starting Radium-223 treatment. My first injection is on May 28th.I was wondering whether anyone here has experience of Radium treatment. It does appear to have far fewer side effects that Cabazitaxel, judging by the SPCs. Would welcome any experiences.
