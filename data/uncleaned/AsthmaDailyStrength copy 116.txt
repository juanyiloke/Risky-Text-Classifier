Ironically on April Fools' Day 2003 - I was diagnosed as a asthmatic. Suffered from Panic Attacks six months later because of it and fought my family over the need for medication to treat it daily. Well, its 10 years later, I'm still alive and accepting my life as a asthmatic. Life doesn't end because you're one, it provide prospective on how to care of yourself. I just wanted to say I'm a asthmatic and I will live my life the best way I can. And I hope my fellow asthmatics can do the same.
