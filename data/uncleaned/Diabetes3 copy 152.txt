Hello and some informationJust to say hi, not been on here to post for some time so no doubt I am well forgotten.I can't believe I have been working in Saudi Arabia now for coming up 3 years, but life has been OK. Some problems with neuropathy in feet and tend to lose big toe nails too easily, but no complaints in general.I was worried when I came here but redundancy and the opportunities in the UK left me no choice. The heat is a challenge but doable.The following may be useless information but heho!Check ups and medication are surprisingly easy over here, although private, with an Insurance Card provided by employer you only pay 10% up to a maximum of less than $25 per visit/consultation. The only thing is they will only give medication for one month at a time, a money spinner.Insulin is expensive. The trick is to tell them you use a lot more than you actually do so get more each visit (I know this is dishonest, but it was a tip from my Consultant here so I don't feel too guilty!).Take care all and if anybody is considering overseas working and I can help with any info let me know. Bye for now
