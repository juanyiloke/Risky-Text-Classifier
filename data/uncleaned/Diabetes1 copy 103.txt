Pancreas TransplantationI read on here that Islet Cell Transplantation was favoured over actual organ (Pancreas) transplantation from a donor. It stated that there were a number of issues if the transplanted pancreas was rejected as it provided other hormones, not just insulin. Well, unless the individuals own pancreas is very diseased it would not be removed so it would be able to provide these other hormones etc. I had a simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant nearly nine years ago and it is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I had previously struggled to control my blood glucose and as such yo-yo'd from between high levels and multiple hypos. This got me down and made me feel very poorly. I eventually went into renal failure after many years of coping with this.Since my transplant I have not need to inject insulin whatsoever and my HbA1C is around 5.8. I occasionally get the odd hypo (which I found strange to start with) but my consultant explained that my transplant might get things slighly wrong on occasions, but this I could cope with!! I cannot recommend pancreas transplantation enough to anyone who struggles with unstable blood glucose. It has given me my life back and has eradicated all my other existing diabetic complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, dumbness of the feet and toes etc. The immunosuppressant drugs I take are no bother to me at all and I have not had any side effects after the initial couple of weeks when my body was getting used to them.I know that my transplant will not last forever and at some point I will need to go back to injecting insulin again. But when that happens, you can bet your life I will be back on the waiting list once more, praying for a second one. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has any thoughts or comments on pancreas transplants or anything else I have mentioned in my post.
