Breast augmentationhi al!I'm looking for some info off somebody who's had a boob job and can tell me about their experience! I've been doing a lot of research on the subject and I'm sure it's what I want as Im completely flat and to be honest it does affect my confidence.ÊI'm relatively young and wonder how mnuch do the implants change with pregnancy as I plan on having kids in a couple of years?can you recommend a good clinic? I was looking into going abroad but i think it's best to stay at home for after care but I was also considering going up north as it seems cheaper there.Is the healing as sore as they say it is???How long were you out of work for?That's all I can think of at the min! sorry about all the questions but trying to gather as much info as I can!!!
