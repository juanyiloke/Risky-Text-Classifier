need help managing________________________________________ok so my back story, i was told by multiple doctors starting around 15-16 that i probably have asthma but never was fully diagnosed but was just given a nebulizer and rescue inhalers multiple different times. ive had pretty sever symptoms on and of back then and into 17 when i started smoking (i know smoking knowing i have asthma was stupid) but by 19 all symptoms subsided and i havent had an attack or even any tightness until now. im now 25 and october i will have been smoke free for 1 year but the worst part is that for the past 3 months im back to pretty severe asthma again. im taking bronkaid during the day and it seems to work pretty good for the most part but my symptoms just like in my teens are constant nd basically unmanageable without medicating so im not sure i want to constantly take ephidrine based meds lol.i use the nebulizer at night to rid the wheezing so i can sleep but i only have 2 little things of the albuterol left and no heath insurance as of now (interview with amazon moday tho) to get seen and get a refill unfortunately so im wondering if theres anything else OTC that can manage id really prefer to avoid the er until i can get insurance lol.im still so confused as to how smoking has stopped my symptoms for so long tho
