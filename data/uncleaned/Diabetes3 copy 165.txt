CGM really not working at allIt keeps telling my im having a hypo, but when I test both my other testers say I'm fine. I know it's delayed by 20 minutes, so I've been testing and swiping to see the difference. And it's more than the 20% accuracy. This will say I'm LO (so less than 2.1) yet my reader will say I'm 5.8. According to this I was hypoing all night (although that is possible). Also, I have been scanning it ever 6 hours to be safe, and yet it's still got a break in the graph.
