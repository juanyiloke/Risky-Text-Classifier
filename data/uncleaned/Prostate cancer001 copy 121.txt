That was the week that was Thought I would share my last week with you all.Basically knew I was due for P.S.A  check and had nagging doubts,anyway had P.S.A test and was waiting for results.My urine flow has been bad for months if not years and I had got used to getting up every hour for a wee,unfortunately this time it decided to clamp up altogether and I sat on the toilet all night but to no avail,I was well and truly blocked and hadn't wee'd for about 14 hours and was feeling pretty groggy.My wife walked down to the surgery at about 8.15 am  and asked for a doctor to ring me,within half an hour he had rung and said I would need to go to hospital.(This was the bit I was dreading as I cannot walk very far and due to the medications I am extremely fat) Anyway the lovely people from St Johns ambulance  arrived and picked me up,I actually walked into the ambulance as I didn't think it was fair to expect them to lift me.When we arrived at hospital they wheeled me right into the Surgical Investigation Unit ,after that had a wheelchair to another department.This is where the fun began I am asked to lie down and they are going to fit a catheter ,first of all my large stomach got in the way then they found that my fourskin had shrunk making it difficult to insert the catheter anyway the top nurse managed to do it .To top it all my P.S.A has nearly trebled from 23 to 62 I am now waiting for another CT scan and then I believe my consultant is going to start me on abiraterone with any luck ,I have now decided to try and shift some weight but I think the steroids,mst,neurotin,indomethacin,amitriptyline which I take will have something to say about that. Imust say how nice everybody from the Doctors Surgery ,St Johns Ambulance through to the nurses at Musgrove Hospital have been
