newly diagnosed and nervous¥	Hi, this is my first post on here, had lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy last week and just waiting for results appointment now. The waiting is awful. Was advised by my nurse before surgery that my cancer is small and that the cells from biopsy showed it was caused by oestrogen which is the commonest type (I didnt even know there were different types). At the moment my emotions are all over the place. I'm fine and thinking positive one minute and then I will just dissolve into tears at the slightest thing. My family are very supportive but I dont feel I can burden them with the emotions I am feeling. Hoping talking to people going through similar will help.
