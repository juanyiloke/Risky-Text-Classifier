Help please!Posted 5 months agoHi, I lost my grandfather over a year ago, and the day he died I saw him in the hospital dead. My uncle told me I didn't have to go in the room but I went in anyway and had my 1st panic attack in 3 years, after we left I kept having flashbacks of him in the hospital, my heart started racing and I felt sick. Everytime I think of him or even the concept of death sends me into complete panic and I feel like I'm going to pass out and I have to lay down until I pull myself together. I've had bloods and ECGS and everythings come back fine. But I think my grandfathers death has really hit me hard. And for the past year my anxiety, panic and depression is so bad. I'm convinced there's something wrong with my heart cause it flutters sometimes. Does anyone else feel like this? please help.
