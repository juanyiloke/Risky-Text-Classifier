What is the point?OverwhelmedI’m fifteen, and I know this assumption may be beyond my years, but from what I have seen of the world and the people in it, there isn’t a way that my life can be of any meaning to it. I may work through the rest of my schooling, enduring the hours of tedious work and studying, and all for what? I will most likely never acheieve anything special, never become anyone great. My life will simply be forgotten by the majority of humanity within a few years after my death, and it would have all been for nothing. I was born into a not-to-rich, not-to-poor family in a good neighborhood with great friends, I have never seen any hardship or suffering beyond the tragedies of a perfect household. I would not call myself depressed, I am a hard-working A (a few A-‘s) student, playing three sports a year, interacting in society in a good and positive way, but I feel like I could work my entire life and have nothing to show for it other than a full bank account and a plaque for “best-employee”. How can I handle just going through the motions day after day, going to and from, working and playing? Is there no end except in death?Thanks,One without a hope
