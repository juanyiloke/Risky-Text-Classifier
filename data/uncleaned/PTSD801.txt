Êthere are waiting lists and waiting listsI have been on the waiting list to get EMDR for 15 months now.I went to my GP last tuesday 30th december with a pain in the roof of my mouth. Gp said due to your history (I have had mouth cancer before, 11 years ago) she said she'd put me forward to get it looked at. I am visiting the cancer unit at hospital on wednesday 7th jan.ÊMaybe I should describe the PTSD pains in my mind and body as a form of cancer eating away at my desire to live with it.
