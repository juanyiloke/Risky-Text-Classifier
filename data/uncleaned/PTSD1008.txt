I'm 19 years old. almost 2 years ago i was in a car wreck (i wasn't the one who was driving and we didn't hit another car). The driver was a guy that I was with at the time and he was going 100 mph, trying to make a sharp turn (I told him to slow down many times but didn't listen to me). What happen was we flipped a few times sideways, hit a tree, then the car landed upside down, then the car caught on fire. I got hurt but the driver didn't. Later I was diagnosis with PTSD because of what have happen. I still freak out when I'm with a car with someone (I get even more freaked out if it's with a guy since guy's drive more recklessly). I still get nightmares of the car wreck happening, kinda like a repeat of what happen but even worse. I mostly get paranoid in a car while on the free way (my car wreck didn't happen on a free way but I've always hated free ways) because a lot of people drive really fast on the free way and don't use there turn signals (I'm from Ohio but live in Florida and a lot of people in Florida don't really drive carefully). So basically what I'm asking is how do I get over this fear of driving and being in a car? I hate always being paranoid and thinking that I'm going to get in another car wreck. I need some help!
