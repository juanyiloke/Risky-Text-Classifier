How do I ask for help?I recently came to realize that I need some kind of help. I was diagnosed a few years ago w/ a chronic illness and lost weight and became fearful of food. This has spiraled way out of control. I don't see the weight loss (at all!) and now, not only do I fear food but I fear weight gain because I can't see the weight I lost so no matter what I can't convince myself to "just eat". I am also terrified that the doctors making me stop working out once they know, which ironically is the ONLY reason I can convince myself to keep trying to eat.I recently switched doctors because I didn't like my old one. I want to tell someone but I just don't know how to start that conversation. What do I say when I make the appointment? Will the office ask me what it is about? I don't want to have to tell a bunch of people before I talk to the doctor. I don't even think I can say it out loud. So what do I say to start that conversation? I thought about telling one of my two best friends but I can't they would blame themselves for not seeing it (one has had an ED, one is actually a mental health professional) and I can't handle any more guilt over this.How do I bring this up to my doctor? I know I need help but I am too scared to act. Too scared they'll lock me up and make me stop running. I can't be put through that, running keeps me sane and keeps me motivated to eat something each day. How do I do this? What kinds of things have others said to bring the subject up with the doctor? What can I expect their response to be? And someone, please tell me it will be worth it.
