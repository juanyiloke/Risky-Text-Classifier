Initially it was diagnosed as short term but we are now 8 months down the line and my PTSD has now been recognised. My GP has been a great support, but the occupational health department of my force less so - I can only think this is fiscal. I am now awaiting treatment on the NHS and a decision whether I am to be retired from the police. PTSD is real and even the strongest of us can suffer. I seem to have dealt with more than my fair share of horrible deaths, including those of children and babies and, maybe, this made me more likely to fall ill. I also used to 'switch off' when dealing with these things - I suppose it was just a matter of time before everything went bang. Luckily things are much better now and officers get the back up and support they need at traumatic times.Finally - sorry if this is disjointed but 60mg of Prozac doesn't help your thinking skills...
