Just diagnosed Info needed________________________________________Hi, I have some what recently been diagnosed with Asthma. I'm 33, in a job where this condition is not acceptable. I have a serious weezing problem but I aced all of the breathing tests. The doctors conducted x-rays which all came back negative for any serious illnesses. I quiet smoking 3 years ago but still have a problem breathing under any load. There are no signs of cancer. I was referred to a respiratory therapist over a year ago but have I still have not went since they gave me the perception that it was just a simple case of asthma. Can someone with similar symptoms educate me on this. I have a wife, 3 kids and I'm the sole provider for the family so I didn't pursue any further assistance due to worries of my job finding out. I assumed that if my condition didn't involve cancer thatI was fine, but a year later, I am having more problems doing any physical activities. I've been jogging 5 days a week with no improvements. I'm physically fit and lift weights 5 days a week but weight lifting has become more and more difficult. Just bench pressing, I need to take breaks. I've had "panic attacks" so they say, twice, and been given a couple different types of inhalers but I don't feel like they do anything. I got hooked up to an EKG machine and everything came back fine. Desperately looking for advice. My background is a smoker from 15-30, ran track, played football in my early days and have been actively involved in sports my whole adulthood. These symptoms have slowly crept up on me to the point where its becoming a serious problem and no-one can give me an answer
