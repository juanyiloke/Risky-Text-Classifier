 Anxiety and breakupsI suffer from a variety of anxiety disorders including GAD and separation anxiety. 2 months ago my long term boyfriend ended the relationship between me and him and I am still not coping without him. When we were together and he used to go on holiday my separation anxiety would cause me to panic and not eat until he would come home. Now we have broken up I am constantly battling panic attacks, feeling suicidal, not eating. It's been 2 months and he has a new girlfriend but I am still not coping,I don't feel I will get any better, I'm exhausted by the mental strain of anxiety and feeling suicidal 24/7, please help
