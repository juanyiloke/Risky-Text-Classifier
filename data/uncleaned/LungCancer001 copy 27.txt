  New member from Michigan and PhilippinesHi everyone. New member here from Michigan and Philippines. When I was told I had lung cancer it really took the wind out of my sails. I went to a VA office and learned because I was in Vietnam the VA would pay 100% of my treatment of my lung cancer at the VA hospital. My doctors wanted to start chemo as soon as they could. After a very long talk with my wife we decided that I should not have chemo therapy. One of my best friends has been fighting colon cancer for two years. Most of his time is spent in bed sick. Both my wife and I feel it would be much better for me if I had a shorter life but very active life compared to a longer but sick and bed ridden life. When we decided to not have the chemo we made plans to return to the Philippines for about 2 1/2 months to visit family ad friends. I wish the best of luck to all of you.
