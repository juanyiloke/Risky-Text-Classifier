Hypo advice pleaseYet again I have over compensated for a hypo - I just panic that it will go even lower and I know I shouldn't but just feel I would rather be high for 6 hours than unconscious!I know the starting reason was not being able to bolus for unexpected meal out (hubby paid!!). Don't know how I managed to leave my pens at home but just had my meter! Jacket potato, tuna/sweetcorn and salad.On getting home was 10.2 - so did evening basal (10u) plus 4u for meal plus 1.5 u for the fruit I would be eating in the next hour.2 hours later suddenly had really bad sweats and trembling hands - sent OH for meter and glucojuice. 2.7 - my lowest reading ever - so juice plus 2 dextrose. 20 minutes later 5.9 so followed up with crusty white bread sandwich with raspberry jam (my hypo treat of choice!)Then I decided to have a large bowl of granola - just in case - as still felt a bit sweaty but also extremely cold (had to wrap myself in a blanket). Tested before bed at 1am - 21.9!!! Decided to do half of a correction dose that should get me down to 11. Had a good nights sleep and woke to a 7.2 so very glad didn't do a full correction.Obviously the granola was a bad idea but felt at the time that the bread might not be enough carbs (25g). So please you good people what should I have done? How do I stop panicking? and how much carbs is your choice when levels start to rise?
