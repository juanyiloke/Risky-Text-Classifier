At my wits end!So, the last week or so has been rough, back and forth to the chest clinic for more tests before they decide if I need to have surgery to take a biopsy of my lung or give me a diagnosis. I'm still having horrific problems with my stomach and bowels, I've put on 14kg in 4 weeks because of the steroids (chest doc hopes to take me off them within the next 2months) and because I'm finding it so difficult to get out of the house and do any excercise. My stomach is so swollen I can't eat or drink half the time and it's so uncomfortable I can't sit upright. And now I'm having such bad hip and lower back pain because of the added pressure and the steroids I can't stand for longer than a few minutes at a time. I've spent most of today on the phone to different doctors and I don't seem to have gotten anywhere. I've felt a bit dehydrated and can't take on enough fluid to make any difference. I've lowered my insulin doses as I'm not eating as much and because I have constant diarrhea but I'm still having at least daily hypos. I'm completely at my wits end with all of this. The last appointment with my gp was pointless, he just sent me for bloods and ignored everything else I said. I can't carry on like this anymore, I don't know what I can do or who I can turn to! Sorry to rant :/
