  Finally, I think I can deal with this________________________________________After two years of barely existing & 20 months of trying 2 ssri's, 1 snri, and three add-on meds, I'm feeling a solid foundation of nearly normal under me. It feels different than the other times I thought something worked.Exercise does little for it (so I do little exercise). Diet doesn't matter -- my diet was very good and healthy when this started. Now I eat cereal for dinner and candy or other junk a lot. I'm thinking that can change soon. I don't drink, so that hasn't been a factor at all. I do toke up a bit, but some days that's what kept me plodding on.I really looked forward to the help I could get with coping skills, etc. in therapy, but I've burned through three therapists (my side of the story is that they dumped me). The support here at PC was better than the therapy I had. I also read a bunch of books on depression for self help (libraries are cool).Aside from feeling like there's something solid to keep me from falling into the muck again, I no longer have the physical feeling of just running through quicksand. Now I can just do stuff -- almost like moving through life can be sort of effortless at times.I'm starting to even want to do stuff again. More often than not the reply is still "no, maybe tomorrow," but it's a start that might gain momentum. I'm even productive at work at times. I no longer feel guilty, undeserving, and ashamed when I feel better -- I just feel better.I still can't fall asleep and stay asleep worth a tinker's damn, but maybe that'll improve with time. Mostly, I don't want to die so much. I'm open to the possibility of hope and worthiness. Maybe I'm not actually bothering everyone all the time 'cuz I'm a worthless lazy bum who can't stop feeling sorry for herself.Well, I wrote all this out because I used to read here to get some kind of a clue of what feeling better was like or how could I tell if the pills were working.Basically, I'm very surprised that something worked for me. There is a chance that all of us can get to the point of feeling like a person. Please keep trying.
