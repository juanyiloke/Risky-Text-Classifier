  Spiriva for asthma?________________________________________Hi I was just curious to know if anyone has been put on the Spiriva inhaler for asthma? I'm a non smoker (always have been ) and my lung doctor recently put me on this for my asthma after having been sick as a dog for over 3 months (phnemonia, bronchitis and asthma attacks)with nothing helping...prednisone for over 2months of it too. But the Spiriva puffer really helps me...so does that mean I've now got friggen Copd now too....and no I didn't ask my lung doctor probably because would have criedif he said yes..and no one in my house smokes either but both parents did growing up.
