Gutsy move to get a job interview or epic fail?2012-03-31, 01:35 PMI contacted a famous celebrity's employee/friend of a company I want to work for. I introduced myself to them saying that I just wanted to get some career advice from them and wanted to setup a phone informational interview.They contacted me back via email and said they would love to chit chat with me but then started giving me the run around and never got back to me.Now there is a job opening at the company that I would be perfect for so I sent in my resume but I'm sure it'll get lost in the pack of resumes.ÊWhat should I do? contact this friend that said they would talk to me but never did.... I'm thinking of telling them that I saw that job opening and would really want help in getting my resume at the top of the pack?What do you think?
