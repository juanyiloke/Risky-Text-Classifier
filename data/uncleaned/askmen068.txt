My boss is an idiot!!2013-03-07, 10:04 AMHave any good (bad!) boss stories? My boss makes a huge deal out of having all there different reports in the computer. He's in every meeting, makes sure all these different features are included, is driving it all. And then as soon as it is actually IN the computer & ready to use ... he forgets how to work a computer. We have to print it out & walk it over to him. I get that we're supposed to be checking it, but G-- D---, put your fat little fingers on the keyboard & make it happen for yourself, you nonce.  grrrr He just spends all day like a nanny. Did you do this, can you bring me this, did I see that? But gets annoyed if anyone actually has a question or problem. Or if we "make him look bad." That one kills me. While he sucks up to his bosses, turning in other people's reports, like he had anything at all to do with it. What's the capital of Thailand! *bang cock*All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit in a room alone. ~ 1623
