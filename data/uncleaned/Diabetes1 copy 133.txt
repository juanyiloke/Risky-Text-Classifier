Fact or Fiction?The internet is a great place for learning things and I was interested in the link posted by bantingnetwork for Almond bread. It looked very nice and I wanted to know exactly how many carbs, how much fat and how many calories. So I was quite happy to while away 1/2 hr looking at the individual ingredients and ran into problems straight away because by Googling "carbs in Almond flour" one of the first few links was one entitled "5 Reasons to avoid almond flour" which I followed, I'm curious, people have been telling me how wonderful this stuff is, what's so bad. The bit that troubled me was what it said about polyunsaturated fats and 20% fat in almonds is meant to be PUFAS. It's supposed be responsible for the following:¥	suppress mitochondrial energy production. In non-chemistry language, in other words, slows down the metabolism¥	encourage an inflammatory response in the body¥	cause digestive issues by impairing the action of certain digestive enzymes¥	slow down thyroid function¥	inhibit detoxification enzymes¥	deplete antioxidants in the body¥	inhibit production of progesterone and androgens while activating production of estrogen. This encourages estrogen-dominancy in the body and this contributes to many health issues like weight gain, PMS, hormonal acne and more.Looks like my 1/2 hour is turning into 1/2 day because some of those claims, if completely true, will certainly discourage me from using almond flour. The trouble is that I can't just believe the first thing I read, I have to be able to substantiate it, perhaps it's just me. It certainly started when I studied Information Systems at Brunel when I was in my early 50s and it was impressed upon all students that the internet was full of rubbish and not to believe everything you read and references to URLs were unacceptable unless referring to academic papers. It seems coconut flour is better. I wonder how long it will take me to find substantiating evidence for that?
