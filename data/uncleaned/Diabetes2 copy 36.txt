Do i need Metformin  6  I am a 54yr old male of lean build, no othe health issues. Four years ago was diagnosed pre diabetic and since then have continued with a healthy diet and lots of exercise (triathlons, marathons). Went for annual check-up recently and blood sugar level came back 6.6 (I have personally tested my sugars monthly over the last four years, ranging between 5.3 and 6.7) and Doc reckons I should start taking Metformin (500mg daily) to prevent any health issues in the coming years. Not one for taking drugs and just wondering if a second opinion would be wise. I realise this dosage is at the lower end but fear of the 'slippery slope' scenario is nagging me. Any thoughts welcome.
