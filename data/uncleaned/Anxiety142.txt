Questions about anxiety Ê12    Alright, so I've made a lot of posts.. I've had good   and bad day. Well, the past couple have been bad. It all started almost 3 months  , dizziness started setting off my anxiety again. The doctor told me it was labyrinthitis about a month or so  . I took zpack twice and tried prednisone and the steroid sent me into horrible anxiety attacks. The pharmacist told me to quit taking it. Now I'm back where I started, my anxiety has been getting so bad that I'm not sure what to do. I have ativan but I try not to take it that much. I had to take one yesterday after a HORRIBLE day of anxiety. Constant all day attack. I went to the ER they told me that I have fluid behind my ear drum but everything else looked good. I'm having horrible symptoms. Right now I can't really do anything with out my heart rate jumping around. It's currentl. 90 just sitting here in the shade. It was in the 100s when I was in the hospital yesterday and if I stood up it would go to 120-135 yet they let me go. My symptoms are;i haven't eaten anything since yesterday morningit's been like this constant for the past couple  . The ativan I took last night made me calm down a bit and put me to sleep but i feel like the hang over effect is adding to this. I'm starting to get bad again I will start having feelings but then they will stop. Please someone help me out. What should I do? I'm to the point where I'm starting to think bad thoughts and that's NOT ME. NONE of this is me.
