I quit counselling. I don't think it was for me. I think anyone considering suicide though should just try a counselor before they go thru with suicide. You may never know what counselling can do, and if you decide it wasn't for you, then there's no harm done and you can have a clear conscience to commit suicide like I have, knowing you did try it first. I hated it but it's not going to kill you (and why would you care? You're suicidal already!) and you don't need to tell them every detail of your life or that you're actively considering suicide. What happens is you'll sit down and the counselor asks you for the main reason you're there and your history, but you give what info you want. The unpleasant part for me was lying to her about how good I feel and how good my week has gone and what my plans are for the future. And it was unpleasant realizing that there's no hope for me. But really? It was worth it to find out. So please everyone here go see a counselor before you decide. It's their job to try to make you feel better and if they can't, then they can't, like I said it's not going to do any harm.So anyway I'm done. I don't have any other reasons to stay alive. It's a weird feeling actually. I always had some thing I didn't want to let go, or thought needed me (to a point), or some other connection left to keep me alive. Having nothing left...my last excuse was going to the counselor...so having nothing left, is a weird mixture of feeling free (to die) and feeling something else I can't identify. I like the free feeling though.
