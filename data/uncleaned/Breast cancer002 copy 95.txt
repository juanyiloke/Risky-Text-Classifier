Good news!!¥	I was diagnosed back in September 2014 with a (supposedly) 10mm grade 1 tumour. I had a lumpectomy and was supposed to then have a few sessions of radiotherapy. At my follow up appointment, this changed to 35mm, grade 3 and her2 positive. I've completed 18 weeks of chemo, had a bilateral mastectomy 12 days ago and have started Herceptin. I'm also beginning tamoxifen tomorrow.¥	I had a follow up appointment today with the surgeon who told me there was no sign of any cancer in the tissue he removed and he doesn't need to see me again till September. I was delighted with the news but then fell apart when I got home after barely shedding a tear the whole time when having treatment.¥	I also feel bad as although I wanted to give him a big hug, all I could do was smile politely and say thank you and I can't help feeling he must think me the most ungrateful person in the world.¥	Am I just being a crazy woman??
