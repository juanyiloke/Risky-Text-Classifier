Asthma  27  About a 6 weeks ago I noticed that occasionally I felt wheezy - I am learning to drive at the moment (at 50!) and it seemed to tie in with when I was about to go out in the car, though it once happened in the middle of the night and woke me up. It only happened 4 or 5 times.I rarely go to the Dr's, but thought I would see her about another matter, so mentioned this and the fact that I had had a mild cough occasionally for a couple of months.She sent me for a chest x ray which was clear and gave me a peak flow meter. My readings were v low, about 200- 250 so after 2 weeks she gave me a brown inhaler to use in morning and night and blue if I needed it.She said that it would help with my breathlessness - but I am never breathless and haven't coughed or been wheezy since I saw here (maybe driving is less stressful now!)Basically I do not feel as if I am asthmatic and inhaler had made no difference - was it just stress?
