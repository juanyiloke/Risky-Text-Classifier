I was diagnosed with exactly 13 years ago, dang just typing that is uggghhhh. So I was diagnosed after being in an extremely abusive relationship, a few.. And a really abusive sexual, physical, and mental childhood. Now I am left with just a part of me that I feel is broken, the pieces of me that used to be. I run away from things that remind me of him. How long can I keep running though? Trauma at the hospital, Wal Mart , and the Mal. I am claustophobic now. It ttok me a year just to ride with a man in the car. He did alot of cruel things to me.. He tried to drown me in a toilet of my blood after the birth of our little girl. And he beat me weakly for 3 years. When I finally left he hid in my attic, and under my kitchen cabinets : ( I was sooooo terrified of him, I finally moved away , almost had a mental breakdown, lost my identity and then was diagnosed with PTSD. Sometimes the flashbacks are overwhelming. I do not trust a man : ( So sad, so I am alone. I hate what has happened in my life. I used to be soooooo BRAVE , so STRONG... Now I am scared of so many things. I wish I could go back to the girl I was lonngggg ago. I hate that I am broken now : ( I wanna be strong and brave. I hate the panic attacks, dissociation, fear, whitecoat phobia, uggghhhhhh. I just wanna be okay : (
