really embarrassing I have gone to great lengths to protect my identity because this is so embarrassing and I can find no reference to this problem anywhere on the internet. I had a successful prostatectomy six years ago. I am now in my mid-sixties. Although I cannot get an erection unaided (Cyalis or pump) I keep getting an intense urge to masturbate. It is a powerful sexual feeling that starts in the area where I assume my prostate used to be. It doesn't ease off at all until I masturbate and after that, I am relaxed for a few days. This happens two or three times a week and I am not finding it a pleasure, just something that is causing me to worry more and more. My wife are very close, but we do not have a sex life and I am too embarrassed to talk to her about this. I just end up feeling really, really guilty about what is happening. I am desperate to get it to stop.
