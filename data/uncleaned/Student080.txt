Gift idead for dissertation supervisorby rri14I'm at the ending of my degree and I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, not only for supervising my undergraduate dissertation, but also for being there for me, for continuous academic and moral support throughout these 3 difficult years. I should note that I am a female student and my supervisor is male and the age difference between us is of only 4 years (we're both in our early 20s). He's also very attractive and popular amongst students, but I do not want to give him other impressions! I've always been ethical and purely professional, and a gift must reflect that. I would appreciate if you could give me some gift ideas, as I've got no clue about which kind of gift would be the most appropriate in my situation. A box of chocolate would not suffice for it's cheap and meaningless. Thanks
