Hi, new to the board here :) I am about to take a big trip without my hubby to a very nice looking (highly recommended) weight loss spa and clinic and I know it will help my asthma symptoms to lose some weight. It's going to be a healthy choice all around, so that part's good. It's just I've never been there and I keep thinking about the trip itself, will I have everything, and I do get anxious flying. Once I'm there I think it will be great and productive for me ~ it's just a change to go away from home like this. I've never really been away from my husband for more than a few weeks and this will be a month of my summer vacation(I'm in the education field). He won't be able to join me due to his job, and my mom always believed it was good I learned to travel on my own (an adult skill LOL)! Tonight I can't sleep well though and feel my asthma symptoms more than usual. I know it's because of the trip ~ not for another week, and I am panicking as it's a new thing for me, so that's what has contributed to it for sure. We also just got in from a week longvacation and I feel overwhelmed with all the things I must do before I leave again for this next trip. I know I just need to take things one at a time and I got this! Has anyone else here ever felt panicked and had asthma before their vacations or trips? I've had this kind of thing before ~ just hate that it's kicked in again. I thought I would feel better sharing my thoughts with fellow asthmatics. I've had asthma since I was a baby, then it went away in my late teens, and then reoccured in my late 30s ~ I've had it ever since. Look forward to getting to know you all here ~ G
