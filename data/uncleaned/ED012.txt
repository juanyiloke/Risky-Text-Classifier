What is Recovery?I've suffered from eating disorder tendencies for almost 10 years. I've been to therapy and several inpatient treatment centers, but I can never seem to really get over it. So, my eating disorder taught me how to destroy my life and treatment taught me how to gain weight. I've never been able to maintain a healthy lifestyle (weight and behaviors) more than 2-3 months. I know what the end of anorexia recovery looks like...a healthy body, great state of mind and no behaviors. But what does recovery look like between sick and healthy? I just want to know what people's experiences have been related to this. I understand abstaining from certain things, but what about meal plans...is it a relapse when I miss a snack or have a meal late due to a real life siruation? Does doing an extra 30 mins of activity count as a relapse because my friend and I decided to take a walk in the park and got carried away talking? There are no fully recovered anorexics I have found in my area, so the light at the end of my tunnel seems dim. So, I just want to know what helped you to make progress. Thanks!
