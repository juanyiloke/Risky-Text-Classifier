ÊSchizophrenia and ESAHi,I know Employment Support Allowance has been covered quite a few times on these forums, but I'd like to know from fellow members with schizophrenia where we stand with ESA.I'm still currently on Incapacity Benefit but I'm really worried when the changes happen and I have to apply for ESA. I'm scared because I don't have serious physical health issues and my mental health problems will be overlooked and I will be placed on JSA.Would my paranoid schizophrenia automatically entitle me to ESA? Would I be put into the support group or the work related group?I'd like to add a poll but I don't know how to - if I may ask fellow sufferers to chime in and let me know your experiences with ESA, are you on it, and are you in the support group?Many thanks
