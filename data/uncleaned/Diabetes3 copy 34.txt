Ocular motility problemsI may have said before that my eye consultant has referred me to Moorfields due to ocular motility problems which she has not had experience of before ( I also have glaucoma and have had a retinal vein occlusion and cataracts removed). I received the referral letter yesterday. An extract from the letter says that I have underlying ocular motility problems and that I have diplopia which tends to be horizontal but can be vertical in nature. We (the consultant/orthoptist) also noted nystagmoid movement in her eyes previously......not really certain as to whether her ocular motility problems (which we've never been able to demonstrate diplopia) are related to chronic fatigue or are caused by something else that we are missing.Alonside this another consultant has said that it is diabetes related, any thoughts please because it makes life difficult and my hospital have no suggestions as to how to correct it. Also does anyone have any thoughts as to how long it might take for an appointment if I've been referred to Moorfields?
