ÊTemptation to BingeSo on Thursday I went to the Christmas party for the mood disorders group that I go to, and wouldn't you know it, I won the "pass the present" game, which was a Christmas CD and a $10 gift card to Tim Hortons. That gift card is sitting there on the coffee table calling out my name. $10 could buy more than enough donuts and crap for me to binge on, and I wish to God I hadn't won that game. I've been trying to stick to a raw vegan diet because I desperately need to stop bingeing and lose weight, but I've already had 2 binges in the last few weeks and I don't want another binge, especially so close to Christmas.
