Network Technology Bsc work placement issue, advice?by alex_wheelerHi all,I'm in my second year of my course and my current unit is a work placement unit, no big issue and when I came to the college open day and discussed the course with who is now my lecturer, he told me that the placement would be found for me like most courses at most universities. Now I've been told that I need to find my own placement, having tried every business with an IT department (requirement) within driving distance of me to no avail, being told (if I get a response) that there are far too many hoops that need to be jumped through or that business are not willing to talk to a student as an individual but would rather talk to the college to legitimise the whole process which my college isn't happy to do. I'm happy with the responses these companies gave me and I understand them fully, but now my college is holding this against me, blaming me for not finding a placement and they fail to understand or accept that companies are quite entitled to say no, and to top it all off, I'm being threatened with failure of my current year as this unit is worth double the amount of points (equivalent to two units and I'm only allowed to fail one unit's worth of points because of policies). My question is: Has my college done wrong by me and can I do anything about it, since I was originally told that the placement would be found for me. I'm top of my class and really don't want to fail and be penalized for something that is out of my hands.Any advice would be great, thanksAlex
