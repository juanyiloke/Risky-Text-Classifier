When inpatient isn't an option and no therapist or partial will take meI was inpatient for 4 months and relapsed immediately. I simply couldn't handle the weight I had gained. I know my behaviors are not healthy right now as I lost a considerable amount of weight in 3-4 weeks since discharge. I do not want to gain the weight back but know deep down I should not continue to lose, the problem is no one will work with me right now unless I go inpatient - I should note, my weight isn't that bad in the big scheme of things as far as anorexia can go. I have very real reasons I can not go inpatient right now (it isn't just avoidance) but was considering partial as way of stopping the downward spiral (still very ambivalent about gaining though). I just don't know where to turn at this point since no one will see me. Not sure anyone can really give me any advice on this but I felt a need to reach out.Thanks.
