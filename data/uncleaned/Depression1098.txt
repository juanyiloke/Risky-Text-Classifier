How I knew it was time to get serious about help.Today after another day of being in the pit I decided to try and cheer myself up with a lollie at home. As I ate it, the wrapper asked: "What's your favourite thing about a person in this room?"As I sat there in a room on my own, I could think of nothing I liked, let alone my favourite thing.Today I realised I need to get serious about help.
