Student Nurse - Study Help   Hello! I do not myself have diabetes but I am a student nurse and I am currently doing a piece of work on diabetes.I have been tasked to "create" an artefact, for young adults living with diabetes. It has got to be something empowering (perhaps for someone who is first diagnosed), something that will be useful and to help them manage there new lifestyle.For those of you who have had a diagnosis of diabetes for a long time, is there something that you can think of that would be really handy for you when you were first diagnosed, perhaps you felt you needed more information on a certain area, or there is something that could be created that would make living with diabetes make a little more sense.I was originally looking into creating an "app" which can monitor all different areas, but I see that this had already been done! I also thought about a text alert system for younger children to remind them to take there insulin at certain times of the day?Basically its got to be something empowering to the person.I do hope that this makes sense to you all!Thank you so much for your time!A confused Student Nurse!
