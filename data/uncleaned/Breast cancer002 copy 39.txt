6 month mammo & itchy nipple¥	Evening all.¥	Hope no-one minds me posting but just need to say this out loud sort of! And my lovely family struggled to cope last year so I do not want to cause them more upset just because I have probably silly worries.¥	I had a left lumpectomy, lymph glands removed, chemo and rads for triple negative bc between April and late November 2014. I was 38.¥	I have my six month mammogram on Monday which in itself is a niggle in the back of my head but.... my breast is quite tender - the slightest bump is ridiculously painful and the nipple is very dry and itchy. Tbh I assumed the latter was a leftover from rads but now I am worrying (probably seeing monsters in the closet!) ¥	Thanks for reading / listening - any and all advice appreciated x
