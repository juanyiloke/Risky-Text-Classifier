Which university should I make my insurance?by LouieSaxHello. Currently, I am in the process of considering which university to put as my insurance choice (either Cardiff or Liverpool). The reasons being, my firm choice is Southampton which is conditional to NHS funding (so if they over prescribe places in August, it could be a possibility that I won't get in) I wanted to put Cardiff as my insurance however that has the same conditions. Cardiff is the uni I prefer as my insurance because of the facilities and the distance away from home (means I can bring all of my things to university via car) whereas Liverpool is unconditional however, I like the university less and its going to be a struggle getting there (I would have to take all of my uni things via train which would be pretty difficult) Which one should I pick for my insurance? Any help would be gratefully appreciated Kind Regards, LouieSax
