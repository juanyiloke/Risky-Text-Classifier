Blood glucose monitoring  2  does anyone know why GPs are so anti patients monitoring their own blood glucose levels? I had been given a kit by the hospital but told by my GP not to se it except with their express permission. However, at Christmas I felt really ill and took it anyway and it was 30.4 since then I have been battling to get it down with changes in medication and this last week it has been down to 5.5 on average. During that time I have been asked to check the levels once each day in the morning but now they are back to where they should be I have been told I no longer need to monitor. I am unhappy about this because what if they go really high again? How would I know? Among my diabetic friends I find this is a common attitude among GPs but no-one knows the reason. Can anyone explain it for me? Or give me any advice or suggestions
