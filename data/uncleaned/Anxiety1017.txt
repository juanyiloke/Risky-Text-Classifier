Low on meds, new doctor might change meds.I'm low on sertraline, and now I have to wait to get more. I have enough left to last until this coming Wednesday. My mom ordered more 2 days ago, and she said my doctor will take care of it. What if it doesn't come next week? I'm worried I'll suffer withdrawal.Mom said I'll go to a new doctor Thursday, and he might put me on something else. Since I'm low, she's suggested only taking half on Sunday to make sure I have some for Thursday, which is the appointment. Will I go through withdrawal?What if the doctor decides I don't need sertraline?
