Asthma and work My boss doesn't understand asthma! Hi everyone!I'm after a little bit of advice! I have quite severe asthma which deteriorates very quickly when I'm exposed to a trigger and I currently work in a bakery. The dust/flour on the bread makes me wheeze and the steam from the ovens makes my chest tight which isn't nice but I can handle it. We've just got new cleaning chemicals which make my chest really bad and I've had several hospital admissions as a result of them.The real problem though is my boss. She HATES me going on sick leave and gets in a real strop because it messes up the rotas. I've been off sick 2 times already this year because of asthma and she gets worse every time. She complains that I don't follow procedure properly when I do and still picks fault at what I've done and makes me feel really guilty. She says its unfair of me to leave them in the lurch and that I need to work as part of a team. I have tried to explain that I get very little warning of an impending asthma attack but she doesn't understand. She makes me feel so unwelcome when I return to work and makes me feel like I'm more trouble that I'm worth and I just don't know what to do.I am leaving for uni in September so it is possible for me to leave work now and just make do until then but I don't want to leave solely because of my boss because then she has effectively won. But the last thing I need when recovering from an ITU admission is the worry about what my boss is going to say and blame me for when I return. I just don't know what to do or how to cope with her. I don't really want to leave work but she makes me feel like I have no other option
