What to do?HelloI'm not sure if this is the right section or how to explain this but here it goes...I want to start by saying that I am willing to work towards recovery. The trouble is I've been having digestive problems (burping, farting, stomach acid, heart burn, sore throat, general aches and pains etc) as a result of a weak stomach from my ED. It makes me afraid to eat because I'm convinced my body will hurt if I do. Which doesn't help my general lack of appetite.I know I should just watch what I eat and eat small portions etc but it's so tiring and frustrating to watch and worry all the time. Plus I seem to continue losing weight just partaking in daily life without meaning to.I realise recovery does not happen over night so I would treasure any help :)Thanks and love to you all,KDekyi.
