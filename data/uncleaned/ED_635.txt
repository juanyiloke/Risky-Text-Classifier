ignorant commentsIve recently been attempting to eat more (at my worst i was eating very little. ive gotten back to healthy looking weight, through a very strict diet and have since been entrusted to make sure i eat enough to keep myself healthy. Today i decided to take a chance and eat in public- in front of people. i wanted to feel a sense of normalicy. I got some food. in my opinion i ate too much, but as i was throwing away what was left, i got multiple comments about how little i had eaten; one going as far as to ask if i had anything at all. i would understand if these comments were coming from people that understood what i am going through, and if they were coming from a place of concern, but their comments felt like an attack: as if i wasnt normal enough. i felt terrible from as much as i ate, then they made me feel like i should have eaten more. i dont feel like i can win. ~hugs appreciated~(Keep in mind i called them ignorant because they didnt know, but that doesnt make their comments any less harmful.)
