Ultrasound Friday...¥	Hello - Ive posted before but just an update as I'm trying to busy my mind... ¥	I found a lump in my armpit and after 2 NHS111 calls and 2 doctors appointments last Monday I was referred to my local breast clinic - I was seen last Wednesday and after an examination the consultant told me he wasn't concerned about the lump in my armpit but he found a lump in my breast.¥	I now have an ultrasound Friday so that can check out the lump and investigate both my breasts...¥	Im 25 and my mum had breast cancer 2 years ago at 43...¥	Feeling nervous but trying to stay positive.¥	I wondered whether people were told at their appointments if they were diagnosed or whether there was a wait? ¥	Thanks ladies xxx
