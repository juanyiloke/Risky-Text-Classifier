The most frustrating part about the way I feel is that I don't understand why...?!ÊI have a family who loves and supports me. Friends who I can lean on and talk to. A boyfriend who knows just what to say. A job. A roof over my head. and most importantly, a million things to live for.....but I can't help but feel like dying is inevitable. I feel hopeless. Empty. And sad.ÊI'm exhausted of feeling like this for years and I don't know what to do :'(ÊI've medicated, therapy, new hobbies....nothing can take away the weight on my heart and I just want to die and be done with it...someone help
