Cannabis and diabetics - pain controlThis was just sent to me in an email.....Your thoughts ....Myself as an RA person ..both feet and knees....I have used for pain and can do so knowing it works for me and do not wish to upset anyone at this thought but now a type 1 it makes thing hard ... Munchies etcBut while I have no meds for RA owing to just being told of type Feet r worst than ever ....So could this be something for us diabetics ????? Or could it fuel spikes and loss of control to our food management I am kinda pulled in two ways What say you ?!?!?
