After two and a half years of trying to get disability I was finally denied for the last time. They don't consider severe asthma as a disabilty or the many side-e ffects that the drugs produce. I take 30mgs of prednisone a day, advair 500/50 twice a day, singulair, plus ipratropium/albuterol sulfate three times a day, plus fluticasone propionate nasal spray, claritan, vicoden for pain, cpap machine for sleep apnea, and wellbutrin for depression. According to the Federal goverment that is not enough. I have gain 45 pounds, suffer from joint muslce pain, sleep 3 to 4 hours a night, lost 40% lung capacity. Oh they did rule that I go no longer do my past employment, which was construction, They said I was still capable of standing on my feet 8hrs a day and be able to lift 50 lbs all day. So If anyone is thinking about applying SSI, think really hard about it. My Lawyer said I had a 99.9% chance of winning due to my severe asthma, well I'm 99.9 percent poor now. The odd thing is I'm currently enrolled in a Federal Goverment Severe Asthma program at UCSF in the Bay Area. Wish everyone good health and a happy new year.
