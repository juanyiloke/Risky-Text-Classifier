How to read my employer?2013-07-24, 09:43 PMI have been 5 months in my job as assitant to CEO and here is the problem. I don't know how to interprete the work climate...and figuring out how to read my bosses.My duties are being delegated to other people as of late...boss wifey pretends to forget me in emails and then later forward correspondence to say she forgot to add me. I am being snubbed on projects which cover my duties...I am feeling left out, incompetetent and unmotivated.Co-workers are confused why my responsibilities are spilling over in their other assigned duties...and I sense some tensions but my bosses have not pulled me aside to have a talk, so I'm worried just thinking hypothetically whether this is leading up to firing me or they are anticipating that I will leave by myself out of frustration??I am emotionally drained from all this. HELP!" I like my eyes the way they are.."
