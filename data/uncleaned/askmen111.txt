Boss is hitting on me2012-05-11, 10:34 AMI've worked for my boss for about a year. He's hit on me and I've turned him down. His office is on the west coast and he comes to my job every 3 or 4 months. The last time he was here he asked to have dinner with me. I can see if it was a professional meeting, but he was in the office during the day we could have lunch. I turned him down. It seems that whenever he's in a pissy mood he nit picks everything I do. I don't know if the woman who ran his business before me had a relationship with him and he thought I'd for it too. I told him I'm in a relationship and he said I didn't know you had a life outside this job. I'm not sure what to?
