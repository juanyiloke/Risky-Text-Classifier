ÊWhy lie? (Is it just me?)Hi everybody,ÊIm having a rough time at the moment. Ive had a bit of a rocky life as it is and im not a real stable person (have bpd). But as I look back on my life I lied about a lot of things. Like major things! I disn't make stuff up completely but I did make them a lot worse as I told them to my group therapy people and therapists. I'm now suddenly overwhelmed with guild and tension in my entire body.I do realise that I lie because I'm scared that if I tell the real version people will feel I have no reason to feel bad about what happend. So I just make things worse so I'm sure that people won't think I'm crying over nothing. Cause in their mind my issues may only feel small, so for them to take me and my feelings seriously, I lie.I'm not sure what to do. Am I alone in this? I feel like a horrible person and am terrified what you think. Have never admitted to lying to anybody. (Unfortunately/fortunately I'm good at it) so nobody knows. Do I come clean? Will people understand or just question everything I say from then on?ÊSorry if I'm rambling. Just nervous.ÊNight night for now, will try to have a sleep.ÊXx from Amsterdam
