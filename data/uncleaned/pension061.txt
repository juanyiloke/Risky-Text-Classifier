grandchildren and divorceWe haven't seen our grandchildren for 10 months since my D.I.L. decided she wanted to divorce my son. Three weeks ago she changed the locks on the doors so his is now camping here until it's all sorted and he knows what money he has left to rent a house. At present he is paying her mortgage and bills on a five bedroomed home and she holds all the aces she will not allow the children to come down and see us. What do we do ? has anyone else been through this? What did you do?
