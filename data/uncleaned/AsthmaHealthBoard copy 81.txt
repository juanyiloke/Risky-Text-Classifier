My Experience with Xolair________________________________________I notice more and more that Xolair is being considered for treatment for people with Asthma or people with severe allergies. I just wanted to share my experience with Xolair. I started receiving Xolair when I was 15. I was on it for five years. I received one injection bi-weekly. I was told I had to have injections bi-weekly instead of once a month due to my severe Asthma and low immune system.While I was just on Xolair, I never once got sick, which for me, was amazing. Usually, I would have to spend anywhere from two weeks to three months in a hospital around September due to my allergies and Asthma. My overall health improved. After a year of success on Xolair, I started receiving allergy shots after being allergy tested. Although I got sick from receiving allergy shots, the effects were minimal. After completing my allergy injections, I stayed on Xolair for a month before I was taken off of it. The result was me being in damn good form and rarely getting sick, usually around September. All in all, I greatly owe my good health to Xolair, despite the side effects.These side effects were not listed to me, but only after receiving Xolair injections did I experience them. When I first started receiving Xolair injections, I weighed 130 lbs. I was small, and could only bench press about 80 lbs. I had little muscle. After receiving Xolair injections for a few months, I found that I was losing inches in my arms, where the injections were given. I lost muscle and I dropped to 120 lbs. My eating habits were the same. I worked out like I always had. I was the same height, same waist size, same everything, but my arms were smaller around and I had almost no muscle mass. Within a year all I could bench press was about 40 lbs and that was straining. After ending Xolair, I have still been unable to build muscle mass at all in my arms.I am not sure how Xolair may of caused and I am not fully sure that it was caused by xolair, even though the condition followed my first receiving Xolair. I insist on telling people this so that if someone does have the same reaction, that it will be stated. So far I have only heard one story like mine. The other side effect was that upon receiving the Xolair injections, I would be very sensitive to the touch on my entire body. If someone tapped me on the shoulder, it felt as if they punched me. My body would get sore easily. These effects did wear off after about 6 hours after the injection.
