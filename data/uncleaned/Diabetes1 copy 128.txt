Trouble with carbsI have just bought a pocket reference book denoting lots of food items that I eat. I am on Novorapid and Lantus. I am still finding it very difficult to know how many units of Novorapid to have eg if I have a rare treat, a Jaffa cake, the book states it has 10 carbs, so how do I equate how many units of Novorapid to have please? I am very insulin sensitive - at present only usually have 1 unit Novorapid, 3 units Lantus. I do find that if I do eat a small snack 1 half unit of Novoecho is enough. Help please. Thank you.
