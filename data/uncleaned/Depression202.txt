  Is it possible to date and have depression?  biggerdandy, 21  I'd like to ask if it's possible to have a romantic relationship whilst dealing with depression and anxiety. I ask this because I'm honestly considering getting into one, but I'm not sure about certain things to do/not do (I dont have much dating experience to begin with). Stuff like 'when's it good to tell them,' what sort of things to avoid doing or not doing.I have too many regrets and missed oppertunities on my plate. I don't want this to be another missed oppertunity and I'm going to at least try and see where things go. There's someone specific I know Ive been dying to ask out but shes been in another country for a few months on a student exchange program through the uni we're both at (though we've stayed in touch the whole time). I found her quite soothing to be around when my depression first flaired up and honestly, being around this person made me feel I had more reserves of energy before I would get low, like i could fight the depression and anxiety better. I at least want to try, but I am bracing myself because of my concerns
