Immune system therapiesI read quite recently that there had been a breakthrough in skin cancer ....some papers saying a cure had been found...based on drugs which make the immune system fight and destroy the cancer.The articles said there were promising results in lung and kidney cancerLast time we went to the consultant I questioned him about this and was told that research has been going in for the last thirty yrs into this immune therapy with poor resultsThis was a big disappointment as I'd had hope when reading about thisHas anyone else any knowledge about this type of treatment and it's success rateThanks
