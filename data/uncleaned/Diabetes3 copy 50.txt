Well, I went for it!I was 4.6 before bed last night, so I thought I would give it a go and reduce my lantus from one unit to...no units   I must admit, it was with a lot of trepidation and I actually found it quite unnatural not to be having my injection - I kept looking over to where my pen was and wanting to pick it up! A survival instinct I suppose, and a habit to break.I felt a bit nervous as I tried to get to sleep, but managed it and woke up at about 2:00 am needing the loo, so I decided to test and see how things were going - I was 4.5  And then, on waking this morning I am...4.3!!!!Can't believe it. This is the first time since I was diagnosed that I haven't had any lantus before bed. Obviously I'm going to keep a close eye on things through the day and I'll let you know how things go  Note: Do NOT follow my lead unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing and in a similar situation to me, which I think is unlikely, as I'm obviously a freak!Watch this space!
