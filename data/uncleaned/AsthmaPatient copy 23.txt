Is it asthma? Also consequences of having it  4  HelloI apologise in advance if I sound stupid and a hypocontriac (which family and friends have said) but I can't help the way I think.A while ago (probably 6 months) I was diagnosed as having asthma but it was at the same time I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks.Apparently there isn't an exactly test to be done to diagnose asthma so I'm still unsure whether it is asthma or my anxiety.I was given inhalers to use and to date I haven't used them.However I do still get tight chested and out of breath when I was but I'm not sure if it's cos I'm just unfit.I just want to know how can I be sure if I do have asthma and if I do when would I know when to use my inhalers.Also I'm due to be going on holiday in a couple of months and I'm scared about the pressure on the airplane and not having enough oxygen to help me breathe.Also can I use my inhalers on there and do I need to let the stewardess know etcAny advice would be must appreciated.
