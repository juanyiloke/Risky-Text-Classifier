Replacement for Maxair autohaler?________________________________________Hi, I'm new to the group and just found out yesterday that my daughter's medication (Maxair) is scheduled to be discontinued in December. She used to to use the Warrick or Armstrong cfc albuterol, and really had no good luck with the hfa inhalers (some made her cough more) when they came out. For most of the time, she uses her Maxair as a preventative before exercise, but she has used it when she has a sinus infection, cold, or bronchitis to keep her open. I'm looking for suggestions to bring up to her allergist. He wants to try her on formoterol as a replacement, but I've read where that is not to be used as a rescue inhaler. I also read where it needs to be taken in conjunction with other meds.She currently does not need to be on maintenance medicine.I'm wondering if a portable nebulizer with something like albuterol would work.Any suggestions would be most appreciated.
