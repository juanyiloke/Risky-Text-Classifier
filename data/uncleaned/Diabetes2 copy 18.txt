More information on diabetes..?  2  I am a coeliac and thus cannot eat gluten containing foods. However I have realised when I eat foods high in fat, my stomach acid rises and I feel poisoned by my own stomach acid. I get blurred vision, sometimes vomit, my heart races and have attacks sometimes also. My last attack occurred at a hospital where my heart was at 170 and I lost all consciousness for a good 20 minutes. Ever since I were a child I'd wake up in the mornings and end up fainting by the time I'd reach the sink, I'd feel light headed and sweat like crazy. I'd manage to get up after a while. Gluten free isn't fully saving me. Is it possible that I may have diabetic ketoacidosis? I have high triglycerides and high albumin protein on my blood results. The doctor told me to stop eating so much protein, but I don't. I have a small portion equivalent to 2 eggs a day. I've also been fluctuating in terms of weight. But have always been on the skinny side. Recently with the severe stomach acid I have been bed bound. Do I sound diabetic at all?
