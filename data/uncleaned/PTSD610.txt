just been told i have ptsdPosted 22 days agoIVe been told i have cancer back in sep of last year,my life has been going to hell since and lost the person i love because of it.The cancer has triggered something from my past that i thought i had dealth with.Im a man that had been abused in his first mariage,from waking up with a gun to my head,to being stabbed in her fit of rage.I had to leave after that,but now i shake,tremble cannot go outside,have rage and cry all the time.The question is will it get better?
