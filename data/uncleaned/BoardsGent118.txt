Sexism on televisionI wonder is this worthy of it's own thread.Sexism on telly, should we have a discussion thread about what shows portray men in a negative light? From shows to adverts there are plenty of examples.I'll share two off the top of my head:I think "Don't tell the Bride" is one of the most sexist tv shows going at the moment. Every single episode the Groom is made out to be "one of the lads" thicko who goes drinking at every opportunity, while the future bride panics over what the groom has planned. Then when you think he's about to eff it all up monumentally, he some how turns it around. Just for the sake of it RTE, try showing us an episode where the guy actually gives a fiddlers about the Big Day. (Of course, that show probably wouldn't pull in the ratings)I think it's one of the most fabricated BS shows going at the minute.The second example is "Take me Out". Now, I know it's a game show and supposed to be a bit of a laugh and light entertainment, but Jesus, some of the absolute tripe the lads are subjected to is beyond ridiculous. Again, for once, lets change up the format a bit, have 30 lads verbally tear strips off one girl, commenting on every thing from her clothes choice to her physical features and see what the reaction is. You can bet your bottom dollar there would be a public outcry.The lads seem to set themselves up for what can only be described as a monumental pish taking on National television, I can't understand why anyone would allow themselves to go through that. Are the oul 15 mins of fame really worth it?
