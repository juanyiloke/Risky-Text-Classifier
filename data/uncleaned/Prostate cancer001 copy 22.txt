Just had Da Vinci surgery Hi allI'm 45 and I only found out in September 2014 that I had prostate cancerPSA 8.0Gleason 3+4 (8 out of 12 biopsy samples positive)Bond scan + MRI show no spreading The Urology team recommended surgery because of my age and the volume of cancer. My Glasgow Consultant said that I would have to have open surgery and that he would only be able to spare one nerve because most of it was on one side and near to that nerve.I had done some research on treatment options and asked about Da Vinci Laparoscopic surgery. To my surprise the Doctor said this is the surgery he would want me to have (he is trained in it) but it wasn't available in Scotland so k would have to go private. He went further and said that if he was me he would go go the Centre of Exellence where he trained - in Leipzig, Germany, with a World leading professor there. Me and my wife greed this option offered the best chance of treatment and best / quickest recovery period.I flew over 2 weeks ago, had the operation on November 25th. The pathology report showed 40% of the prostate had cancer, but it was contained inside the prostate and hadn't spread. All surgical margins were clear and my (removed) lymph nodes were clear. I Had a catheter in for 5 days and on getting it out I have about 97% continence and use one pad per day for safety as in the afternoons I have some slight dribbling but it's getting betterIt's still only a few weeks since the op but I don't have any erections yet, I'm on Cialis 5mg daily but this only seems to improve half blood flow as I don't get an erection - more like 40% semi during the nightI think I'm still getting my head around it all as it's been a whirlwind time since September but I hope that this has cured itMy biggest disappointment was the postcode lottery meaning this vital treatment isn't available in Scotland, privately or NHS William
