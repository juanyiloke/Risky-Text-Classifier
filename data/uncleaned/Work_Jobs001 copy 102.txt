End of contract query________________________________________Hi all,Anyone have any knowledge on a fixed term contract coming to an end??Can't seem to find the right info online!!Basically I want to leave my job soon .I have been there almost a year and my fixed term contract is ending in two weeks.So, can I leave at this point ? Is there any minimum notice when the contract is due to end anyway?I have not been asked to sign a new contract nor has it even been mentioned.Thanks in advance if anyone can help
