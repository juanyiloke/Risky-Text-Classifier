Accepting Your Mental Illnessby Danieleaf » Fri Jun 12, 2015 3:28 pmAfter being diagnosed, I immediately did my research and started out on a treatment plan, hitting things head on. I've definitely made progress in a couple of areas, and I feel good about it. However, I've come to realize that I've been approaching everything all wrong, like my goal has been to "cure" myself, instead of learning how to cope and live with my particular flavor of mental illness.Because of this, I'm finding myself extremely disheartened, knowing that this is something that will always be a part of me. Sure, I may get better at managing symptoms, but I will always have to deal with having a mental illness.How do you motivate yourself out of these moments, when you find yourself lost to your own future?
