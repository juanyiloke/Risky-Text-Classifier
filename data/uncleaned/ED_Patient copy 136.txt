Hi to person with the comment no.2, i feel u fear eating...Hi to person with the comment no.2, i feel u fear eating foods because of the fear of getting back to the weight u was at before. But just let go and leave it in Gods hands. Jus eat something nice and big at least once a day... it will make u feel 1000 times happier in yourself and then u may start believing in yourself huni, im sure u can do it. And also well done for expressing how u feel, part of u must know how thin u are!! Now it's time to break free from this cycle, just eat a little more than u do know, even spend some time with ur family for dinner and enjoy ur time them! Let me know how u feel about that, or jus for a progress report, hope i cud help in any way! God bless, take care of yourself :-)
