A boring 2/3rds post - and an important last paragraphWell I'm 2/3rds through the worst cold I've had in many a year! Perhaps in my life ( ? ) Day 1, went to bed with the characteristic nose and throat sensitivity that goes with the onset of a cold.Day 2, Got up not feeling well and two hours later sneezing, runny nose and eyes watering. Started taking aspirin/paracetamol. Evening, throat & chest getting sore. I began drinking home made cold remedy infusion made with blitzed fresh ginger, lemon juice, menthol crystals and sweetener and warmed up in microwave. I drank this at hourly intervals.Day 3, feeling terrible, shivering, painful cough, temperature, sweats, severe headache and aching body. (I thought I can't have flu since I had the jab early October. I know the Vaccine is not live so can't be attributed to that) Stayed in bed for most of the day.Day 4, Feeling somewhat better but coughing up some nasty blood tinged 'blobs' and very painful too. Nose and eyes have stopped running and my forehead is no longer on fire. I think I'm through the worst.   Important bit:Had a light/ish brekkie and bolused for the carbs, tested a few hours later...   OMG! -  32 mmol/LI immediately did a ketone test with Ketostix and couldn't believe the result- 8 mmol/L That's almost in the Deep Purple band, I repeated the test a few moments later and result was the same. Took the neccessary actions pronto! Four hours later I'm in the pink at between zero and 0.5. That was scary.
