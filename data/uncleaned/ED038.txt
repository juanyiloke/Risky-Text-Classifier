My new hair cut makes me look fat :-(I know it's kind of silly but I just got a hair cut and the woman cut it much shorter than I wanted. I feel so unattractive and it just spill over into all other aspects of my self/body that I don't like and that make me feel unattractive. As soon as I got home I ate a lot and immediately felt super guilty and just down on myself. I don't know what exactly I'm looking for by posting but I have a meeting to go to tonight but I'm seriously considering not going because I feel so unattractive. What do I doooo?
