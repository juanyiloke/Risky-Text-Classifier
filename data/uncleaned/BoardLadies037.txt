Breast ReductionHello,I'm hoping for some advise from women who have previously had/ or are also considering breast reduction surgery.ÊI am 28 years old and have 34E/ 34F breasts. I'm a size ten and have for many years been self conscious about my breasts. They are sagging and not very attractive. Bra straps leave sore marks on my shoulders and bikinis are a no no.ÊWhen I was 19 years old I went for a consultation with a plastic surgeon and did not go through with it because of the cost.ÊI am aware that this procedure is costly but what I am hoping to find out from this thread is what are the best places in Ireland to have this procedure and if anyone knows of price plans for this type of surgery?ÊAny advise would be greatly appreciated.ÊThanks :-)
