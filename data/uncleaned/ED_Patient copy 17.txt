What is the Best Start to dealing with Binge EatingFor many years I have had based my happiness and self worth on my size, I have made myself sick, I have limited my food intake whilst all the time exercising manically. All weight lost usually returns and some. I have really struggled with the latest weight gain as someone very close to me passed away and I feel like giving up. My support system has gone, there is no one to tell me to not be silly eat, or go out or let’s go out. I have been exercising manically and as a reward for exercise have taken in way too many calories, so I am steadily growing and I can’t see an end to this circle. I have limited throwing up to when I have really over indulged which is usually once a week but the constant over eating is daily. I am just so confused and don't know what to do, please if anyone can offer some advice. Thanks
