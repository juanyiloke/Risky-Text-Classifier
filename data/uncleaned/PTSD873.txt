ÊI'm a mistake..Hello, I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Just want to tell you I kept having bad episodes during the past 2 days. My anxiety levels were so high I couldn't control it. I kept walking around mindlessly and over thinking until my brain hurt for 2 days. I kept feeling like I'm about to fall down. Today, the pain subsided and my anxiety subsided thank god. and i felt so depressed. I kept on eating and eating. Cannot properly sleep. Scared, paranoid I even thought someone was gonna kill me outside my house waiting for me. I've only had one session with my psychiatrist and he hasn't put me on medication. Do you think I need it ? I remember one time it was so bad my eyes started twitching, I wanted to faint, my legs were shaking real bad and I felt so disconnected. That happened last 4 weeks ago. I had to be given a shot idk what kind of shot but it cooled down my anxiety down until i slept really deep. Idk what to do with myself sometimes I just want to commit suicide for real and just end my life. It's a pain to fight my anxiety...
