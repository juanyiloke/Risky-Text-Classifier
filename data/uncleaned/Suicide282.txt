why?I used to think the world was mine, and everything I wanted to do I could if I worked for it. I slaved away at my schoolwork and tried my hardest to keep my mouth shut about my overbearing mother's tight leash. But year after year I was met with harsh criticism, and hardships that I had no way of knowing how to overcome. I proved to myself again and again how incompetent I am. In the midst of my shame, I lost all contact with my peers and became a pariah. Of course, after losing the safety of being in a group, I was signaled out and I was tormented by my classmates every day. I developed insomnia, paranoia, and severe social anxiety. Since, I have not felt like I have slept at all, and that was five years ago. I can't keep any sort of relationship for any length of time. I am always alone even when I'm surrounded by people. I hate leaving my house and I find that I have begun to hate everything. I hate people who are happy. I hate the sun. I hate people who have friends. I feel like such a detestable person, I can't even stand to look at myself. I tried to kill myself eight times but I couldn't even do that right, and now I'm here looking back on my pathetic life and I can't go on. The people that walk the earth are the bane of my existence, and every time I walk outside I feel like I'm being poisoned. I can't go on, I'm so weak. I feel like I am already dead and I'm just waiting for someone to put me in my grave. I find myself begging for the end at the beginning of every morning. What can I do when I just hate life and myself so much?
