Tight chest after a cold (Adult asthma) I'm 58 and relatively new to dealing with Asthma, (only diagnosed under 2 years ago). I'm now on 2x 125ug Seretide twice daily which is ok most of the time to manage the asthma symptoms. Unfortunately I get colds fairly regularly, and after any cold nearly always experience a tight chest, that leaves me very uncomfortable for several days. Should I be looking for some additional medication?...as Ceretide is a combination of steroid plus long acting b-agonist. I'm advised you can't up the dose on Seretide to deal with short term issues...what should I do to relieve the discomfort?
