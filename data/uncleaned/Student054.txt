Leeds v Bristolby prosphistoryAs I'm sure you're all aware the UCAS deadline for uni decisions in rapidly approaching and I am SO TORN between Bristol (A*AA) and Leeds (AAA) to study History. I am predicted A*AA.Has anyone firmed either one? My concern with Bristol is that it's a bit 'rah' and when I went to the applicant day almost all the people there were from the home counties, and many were privately educated. I live near London and I feel like if I went to Bristol I would be going from one bubble to another. Have also heard the History course isn't great? HOWEVER it has an excellent rep. Leeds looks like an amazing place to live and study but Bristol has the edge in graduate prospects etcAnyone want to add their two cents? Which one would you go for and why?
