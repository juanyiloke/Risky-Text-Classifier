I think I made a mistake.by scrunkieI dropped out of first year Law because I found it dull and too difficult (I was passing, but just barely with 2:2's), I also hated the University I was at too. But now the more I think about it and the more I see my old classmates doing their assignments and talking about Law, I feel like I miss it. Even if I'm just watching Judge Rinder or something stupid, I miss learning about the Law. It got me thinking, I don't know if it was the University that made me miserable and not the course, or if it was both. I've applied to another University to do a different course this September, but now I think I've made a mistake? But then I don't want to choose Law again and not like it... again? Stupid to make the same mistake the twice.
