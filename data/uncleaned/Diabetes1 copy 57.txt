Just fed up to the back teeth!Hi guys, Its me again, I hope you'll doing well!I went for my second diabetic checkup with the nurse and she was reallly happy with everything!.. then I get a phone call regarding my urine test and it states on my notes " Poor managment of diabetes" so I have been asked to make an appointment to discuss meds...I am currently on 1000mg Metformin, plus 40g simvastatin,.. also my last blood test says my Cholesterol is 6.5 and my Tricilygeics ( I dont know how to spell it! lol) is raised and my liver count is raised too.. I am on Bp meds, I also have Pcos, I am low on folate due to my pcos, my hair is now thinning... I want to cry out loud with tears as I feel I aint getting no where. I have lost a stone in weight so far and trying my damned hardest to get fit. I am now 15stone and I am 5foot5inches tall. I feel soo stressed.. I feel like everything is piling up against me. I am 34 yet feel like 84 right now   People telling me I cant do this and you should do that... I have this.. and I have that! ..... I just need to vent. I feel like my own body is trying to strangle me..and No I do not eat takeaways every day and I cook from scratch all the time I just snack on the wrong things to often... which Ive stopped. Its been 4 months since I had the news of my health and it just seems I am snowballin!! Someone to talk to in same situation as me would be immense right now   xx
