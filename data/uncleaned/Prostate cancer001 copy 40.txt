daVinci vs TURP Hi, all.We've got the scores on the doors so far: Gleason 7 (now down to 3+4 rather than 4+3 after the second opinion team), no bone or other involvement and it's contained in the capsule on one side, 3 out of 7 cores. OH was galloping into choosing a TURP over the daVinci but after a "whoa there, folks - take your time," from others on the site, we need to find out what's in the choice. It's all written down in a cool, calm and collected way in the blurb, but what about real people?From what I'd read of the posts on here, the daVinci guys seem to have fewer problems afterwards with pain, ED and incontinence but that doesn't seem to be correct according to someone in the know on here and I might be selectively remembering what I've read. I've tried trawling the posts for info, but I'm finding it hard to compare all the different strings and anyway, if I can get a few answers in one place then my OH might look at what's here so I just want to ask a simple question.If you've had a radical prostatectomy through either TURP or  daVinci, how do you find your recovery? do you think that it's true that there is less blood loss, incontinence and ED after daVinci or do you reckon it's manufacturer's blurb or NHS blurb for "cheaper to do"?Any replies would be gratefully read. Thanks.
