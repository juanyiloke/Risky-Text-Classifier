Motivation...I've been suffering from bulimia for almost 2 years and after three months free of purging, I relapsed. It has now been two weeks, but I often find myself discouraged, wondering if I'll ever fully recover. Today I came up with a list of positive reasons to keep moving forward and thought I'd share them with you all.1. I want to live a long, healthy life with a fully functioning body. I need my heart, bones, and organs to function effectively if I want to feel my best.2. I want to be honest with myself and others.3. I want to have a strong, fit body. I need my body to run, swim, jump, dance, climb, etc.4. I want smaller dentist bills and compliments from my dental hygienist. I want my teeth to be strong and white.5. I want to have children someday, and I need a healthy body as a home for a growing fetus.6. I want to feel proud and confident, not because of how my body looks, but because I work hard to keep it healthy and feeling wonderful.7. I want to nourish my body and enjoy an abundance of healthy foods.Feel free to add to my list :)
