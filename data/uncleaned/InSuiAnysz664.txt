I am 29 with debilitating Social Anxiety Disorder. I need help. Maybe someone to text to from time to time. I am transitioning from military to civilian because of this issue, it is not by choice. I have had a plan to end it ever since i could remember, maybe around 10 years old. Even at that age i knew i would not grow up normal. The military had just postponed my plan. I only have 6 months till i'm out and have just decided that i also have 6 months left on this earth. If someone is out there please reply, rangelb85@gmail
