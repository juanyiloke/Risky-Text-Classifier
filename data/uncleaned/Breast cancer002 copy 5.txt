DAIRY FOODS HIT BREAST CANCER RECOVERYHi, I thought I would share this with you as not too sure what to make of it. I was given an article from a newspaper about dairy foods hindering the survival of women with breast cancer.  It said US scientists suspect that because milk and other dairy foods contain the hormone oestrogen, which encourages tumour growth, this could hinder the survival of women with breast cancer.   They point out that most milk consumed in Britain and the US comes from pregnant cows and is rich in oestrogen.After reading this I found a book called Your Life in your Hands on the internet written by Professor Jane Plant, herself a scientist who had been given 5 months to live after her cancer returned for the 5th time.  She decided to look into the facts that showed a background rate of breast cancer of 1 in 100,000 women in China compared to a rate of one in ten in much of the West; she checked that the information was correct with senior academics that she knew well in China and also with some Chinese doctors who told her that they had hardly seen a case of breast cancer in their careers. This was because they rarely consumed dairy products.Should be glad of your comments on this.Chrissyxcc
