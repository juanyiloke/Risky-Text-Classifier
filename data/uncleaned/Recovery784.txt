Hungry and getting fatterHi all. I've been told that it's part and parcel of antidepressants to gain weight. Since I've been taking them (about 3 months) I want to eat constantly even thought I'm not hungry. I'm unmotivated and rarely go to the gym any more.  I know I've gained weight as my jeans are all really quite uncomfortable. Is anyone else going through this. Has anyone BEEN through this and beaten it??  I'd love to know how to beat it as I'm getting even more depressed about it and I'm at a stage where I wish I could get really sick so I'll lose weight. I try to eat mainly fruits and vegetables all day but the yucky stuff like chips and lollies are creeping in. It's disgusting. When I eat, I really gobble my food down - it's almost like a full on binge. I've been on antidepressants before and came off them for that reason. I'm at a point where I want to come off the meds again for the same thing. A could of friends have suggested I go back to my GP to get a prescription for weight loss drugs. I don't think he'll give it to me as to most people I don't look fat and my BMI is in the top end overweight range although some of it is muscle as I used to work out quite hard until all this. I think about my weight so much that it consumes me. What are everyone else's experiences - male or female.
