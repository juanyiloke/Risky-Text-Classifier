Form letter or no?2013-02-05, 03:24 PMSo I recieved a form letter in response to submitting a job application.It is for a salaried high level position (if that matters?)It reads Thank you for your interest yada yada .... process will take a few weeks before we decide who to interview yada yada........then "In the meantime, if another opportunity presents itself to you, please give me a call".yada yada the end.Is the "In the meantime........" sentence part of their form letter? Would you really send that to a whole pool of applicants?Trying to determine if they have interest already or not....dependent on that sentence????Part of form or addition by staff?
