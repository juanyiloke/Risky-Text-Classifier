Tricks of Shaving!This is going to sound really stupid of me to start this thread! But I need help!The thing I find is Im always buying disposable razors! And even new razors heads which are more expensive! What am I doing wrong!So I go with a disposable razor with maybe half my light and then it stops working cos its full of hair and then I throw that one in the bin and get another. Like I tried leaving them in hot water to get the hair outta them to try to use them again.I find the same problem with using those fancy Venus spa breeze and Venus Olay razors.Can you share your tricks and tips with me?
