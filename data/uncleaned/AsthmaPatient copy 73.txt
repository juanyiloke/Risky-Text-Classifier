Asthma caused by shock My son, when a child, a three year old, very, very suddenly developed chronic asthma. This, most definitely was caused by a shock, by not being treated gently enough by a parent. It must be that the shock, the sudden rough treatment, that caused his airways to narrow. There was no other reason for the sudden onset. This is most definitely what happened. There is always the guilt in the parent for ruining the child's life, and that of his siblings, to a certain extent. My son scarcely went to school. Therefore, it must be stressed that all children should be treated with kindness at all times.
