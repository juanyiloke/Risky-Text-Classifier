Even I can be positive sometimesMost of the time, I tend to close myself off from the world...maybe I have become cynical, but I think of myself as a realist. In any case, I thought isolating myself from everyone would be the way to go. But it actually makes me feel more lonely, and sometimes I don't realize how much even one person can help. Today my neighbor was supposed to meet me, but she never came over to my house, so I was a bit disappointed. But when I went to the laundromat, I started talking to this nice person there...I found out that we have so much in common, and I really felt at ease talking to her. I'm a shy person, so it's hard for me to open up, but I am starting to become more social. So I'm excited at the prospect of making new friends, and to remember that not all friendships will end badly. I never thought I'd look forward to anything, but I'm going to leave myself open to new experiences in life. Closing myself off from the world is not the way to go if I ever want to get better.
