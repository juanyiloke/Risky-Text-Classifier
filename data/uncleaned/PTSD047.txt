Wanna Get F#%*d Up!Therapist will be gone for a month. Our session ended weirdly because she had to pull me out of dissociation most of the time and we didn't get to talk about things I could work on while she's away. I just wasted a session curled into myself.And I HATE current physical therapy. I have to go one more time just to decide if I want to quit or want to stay (like maybe I'll have the guts to ask more questions...like get out the creepy clinical room, stop touching me without telling me what your are doing, etc....I'd rather be in a gym.I just took 2 ambien and am in no position to drive to the gas station for another pack of cigarettes. I picked gross stumps off the garage floor to smoke a bit.I'd love Pilates lessons...they = empowering. But I can't afford them. So my therapist is gone, and insurance is paying for physical therapy I loath and am not making use of. I have no support. I'm just back in I-WANNA-GET-f*ckED-UP-LAND....where I don't have to care about any of this.
