Êzyprexa- have i f***ed my brain?'ve been taking olanzapine for 7 years.For 9 months I was on 25mg and for the rest of the time 20mg.Will I ever be able to function without it and what arethelong term sides of taking this drug?Does anyone care?It has ben beneficial but to what cost?Dooes anyone care if I die 30 to 40 years early?What if I decide to stop taking olanzapine?What will be the shit hitting the fan?I think I have stopped taking it ok only for a day but I will continue.This is something I have control over andthat is a rare thing.Now Im not suggesting people should go cold turkey so don't accuse me of that,but this is my way and instead of killing myself I choose to fight against olanzapine withdrawl!And I will win.So long as I don't get sectioned and drugged against my will.That would be a disaster and would fuck me up in many ways very seriously.I have been away for a few months because my computer died on me and no one missed me.I didn't get a single message.I think the schizophrenia forum is a cold and lonely place on this site.I didn't go to my recent appointment with my psychiatrist for good reasons.I cant live like this anymore.I need to be allowed to work through my problems without drugs like what I've been fed over the years.Tere is an illusion of wellness which has the ultimate price which I'm not willing to pay.Does anyone give a shit about me? think not and I have become used to this situation.I am preparing for a long night as insomnia is the first side effect of olanzapine withdrawl.I just want to be myself again.Is that so much to ask?Why have I been condemned to a lifetime of medication?This kind of life is not worth living.
