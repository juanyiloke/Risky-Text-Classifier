im awaiting the results of a breast lump biopsy very anxious¥	 ¥	hi everyone this is new to me but I really need someone to talk to I found a lump in my right breast about 4 weeks ago went to the gp and she referred me straight away to the breast clinic I got an appt with two weeks and was seen last week I got a mammogram , ultrasound and biopsy he said there was a mad there but was he thinks its benign but wanted to do the biopsy as he wasn't sure. Ive been pretty good at holding it together but now almost a week afterwards I'm starting to get very worked up . I called today and was told I wont here till they meet up to discuss my results. I'm only 36 every thought is going through my head including very vain ones is this normal ?? Xx
