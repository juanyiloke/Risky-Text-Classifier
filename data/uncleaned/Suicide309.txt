I've been contemplating for several yearsI've been contemplating suicide for several years. I'm 46 and my father committed suicide in 1975 when I was seven. All these years I've just wanted to know why he would do that to his family. I'm completely miserable pretty much all the time. I play a good role in pretending to be "normal" but I'm dying on the inside. I have a good career, very smart daughters (19 & 22), and pretty much everything I could have asked for in life. My relationship with my wife of 27+ years is great when it's great and terrible when it's terrible.ÊI'm not looking for anyone to try to convince me not to kill myself, just looking for the most effective and painless method. I know the forum rules do not permit this so I won't ask for advice. I just want to end it for myself and those around me that I make suffer due to my sadness. My family deserves better and I know that.
