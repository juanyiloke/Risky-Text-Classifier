Not Had A Good Day (apart from a special event talking about Cancer and Charity Ball on the radio)¥	Hi people,¥	Hope everybody is alright.¥	I've had a really troublesome day (if only I was a good 40 years younger I would have enjoyed my trip to the dentist - he is absolutely lovely)¥	I lost my bank card between the hole in the wall and the car after that¥	Spent lots of time chasing around contacting the bank and then of course I needed to get some money somehow (I had only got a bank account balance before losing my card)¥	Then - I spent a good 20 minutes talking to a DJ on local radio about The 1st Inspiration and Hope Summer Ball I've organised with MacMillan getting a third of funds raised.¥	After spending this afternoon cold calling more businesses and getting nowhere because the people I needed to speak to were either in meetings after the bank holidays or actually on holiday this week I am now sat contemplating the fact that in the morning I have to battle through rush hour traffic and somehow park my car in the hospital car park then go and face my Cancer Consultant for my 2nd year review following my op in May 2013.¥	My appointment is 9.25 - I suppose I should be grateful because I won't have all day to be worrying about it.¥	I really hope that everybody who faces their Cancer Consultant tomorrow gets good or positive news and send everybody a big hug.
