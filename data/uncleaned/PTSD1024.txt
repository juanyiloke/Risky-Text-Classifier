i am a 70% service connected disabled veteran, of military sexual trauma. I was also diagnosed bi polar.. I requested an increase in my rating to "include bi polar as a secondary condition to ptsd. they denied that it was connected to ptsd. generally speaking, does anyone in the medical field believe that bi polar can develop because of severe ptsd. if you know of anyone, please refer me to them. i am going to appeal their decision and need all the support and evidence i can gather. when i ask my own phsyco dude, he kind of dismisses the question. he just asks me,,"do you think your bi polar"..... he knows all the gory details,,,of course i am. why else would my medication bottle say "for bi polar symptoms" anyway, if anyone can lend information.. much appreciated thanks
