Radiotherapy following Hormone treatment Hi,I am new to the forum. Aged 67 I was diagnosed with Gleason 7 prostate cancer which has spread beyond capsule.  Bone scan in November showed no spread, so that seems good.. Currently,  on Zoladex LA implants every 12 weeks.  PSA was 264 in Nov 2013 on diagnosis , PSA 23 in March 2014, and now PSA 11 in July 2014.  All moving in the right direction. So far all good news. Recent Urologist Appointment suggest Radiotherapy not an option for the time being but I am to continue on Zoladex with 3 monthly review, next appointment in November 2014. Feel great apart from odd hot flush, general bone aches after golf, and growing some man boobs.  Anyone in a similar situation and  is there a view that I am on the right therapy- what is next? Regards Geronimo
