Peanut Butter And Depression   BubbaG33k , 04 Mar 2008Hello,Just curious if anyone has had the same experience I have had with Peanut products. They affect me just like SSRIs like Prozac, celexa, and cymbalta only in reverse. A gradual increase in depression over time.I always knew Peanut butter made me depressed but always felt it was when I ate large quantities. For example two tablespoons a day for two days strait I would definitely notice. Generally with crackers :-)How ever recently I was having issues and stopped all peanut products altogether. It has been three weeks now and it is amazing how much better I feel.Has anyone had a similar experience?BTW peanuts have Tryptophan which the liver turns into serotonin. I have no idea why it affects me that way. Some people recommend peanut butter to cure depression but for me it appears a big no-no. I need to read Wikipedia more on Tryptophan.Bubba
