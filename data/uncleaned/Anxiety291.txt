anxiety and youth - please share your experiences?Hi everyone,ÊI'm 23 and I am currently trying to overcome my anxiety, but even typing this is difficult. I am currently in college and trying to figure out my life while simultaneously trying not to let anxiety get in the way of the goals i want to achieve, but at times I feel utterly defeated and won't ever get out of the anxiety that rules many aspects of my life. There was a time when i did not have anxiety, and everything seemed possible, but due to family issues and being in a constant state of heavy stress, i had developed severe anxiety where i would be perpetually trembling and was in a state of constant fear. Now, the things that spur the trembling could be something as little as hearing my own voice. I have a paper due and a verbal presentation next week, which has me absolutely paralyzed and which lead me to find this site. I know that getting a low grade will not destroy my life, and i feel silly for feeling so completely terrified - but it is in fact how i feel. I do not have any parents and I only have 2 other family members, both of which are far away. My only support system has been myself, and i had worked hard to get out of detrimental situations when i was younger. But now i am finding it so difficult to rely on myself when i am my own source of fear.I just wanted to hear your experiences, what you are currently going through/have already gone through in dealing with your anxiety while going through college, being in your 20s, or being in the stages of trying to prioritize your life.
