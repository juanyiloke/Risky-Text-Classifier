Basically kicked out of IOP for being too crazySo, I posted a few weeks ago about going into an IOP program.It was awesome. I went for four days, and loved it.Problem is, I was actually HONEST for once about both my problem with food, and my other problems.And they decided I was too crazy for their program. So. I got (basically) told either sign up for a higher level of care, or stop coming.I chose to stop coming.This hits all my buttons because I already felt like I didn't belong there, because I'm too big to have a disorder. They basically affirmed all my fears about being crazy, needing to be in a hospital, and being "bad."Thing is, i'm actually doing really WELL right now, and I was doing even better with the program. They took "I had a problem with this a month ago" to mean "I'm actively doing this right now."And that hurt, because I thought I could trust them.Inpatient is not an option for me, for a variety of reasons, not limited to I can't afford to be off work. yet everyone's thrusting me in that direction. i know I don't need it, but it's hurting to have people try to shove it down my throat.I DO want to get better. I thought I could. Now I feel like I'm stepping a hundred steps back.
