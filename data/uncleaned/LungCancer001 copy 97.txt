Tarceva side effectsI am a 75-year old non-smoking woman, and was diagnosed with lung cancer, confined to the right lung, this past July. Tests showed that it was the genetic mutation that often responds to Tarceva. I started treatment with it about a month ago. Thus far, my side effects have been minor diarrhea (1-2 episodes daily), tiredness, some loss of appetite and dry sensitive skin on my face. The latter is very annoying, as even the mildest moisturizing creams and cleansers make my face sting. But, if the Tarceva works, it's worth it! I am scheduled for another CT scan in late November to see whether Tarceva is effective for me.To add insult to injury (or the other way round), on my way to see my oncologist two weeks after my lung surgery, I tripped on some uneven tiles in the hospital hallway and broke my hip! So I had hip replacement surgery the next day, and have been doing physiotherapy since then. Luckily, I was in good physical condition before my fall, so am making very good progress - walking without a cane, able to climb stairs, etc.
