seven months into uni i have realised that i am not interested in economics orby Costanzasstudying for that matter. my parents had really high hopes from me and i did extremely well in high school. i also feel that i made a mistake by enrolling in such a competitive university. all my fellow indians also think of me as a failure who went to uni abroad just because i couldn't get into unis in my own country. however, this is not the case . i also get along really well with western people rather than my countrymen and am yet to come across an indian whom i got along with. i feel that i have to prove all of my countrymen wrong by doing the best but have very little motivation in life. i have taken to bad habits like drinking and smoking which won't help me in the long run but re surely helping me for now.
