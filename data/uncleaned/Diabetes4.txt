The Penny Drops!I posted a topic some days ago titled 'Beginner' and you were all very helpful and sympathetic in your replies - and I'd like to say a BIG thank you here.  Basically I'm dealing with a new Type 2 who is in denial.I've found the real problem with hubby's resistance to changing his diet.  I've been making tasty, low carb meals for the both of us (I am coeliac so they suit me) but he's been adding extra things (mostly high carb and sugar) and getting cross when I say anything.  Today he has told me of his 'plan'.He has another apt at our Diabetic clinic for more blood tests and has been told that if there is no improvement (from following the high carb NHS diet sheet) he will have to be given medication.  Then, he says, HE WILL BE ABLE TO EAT WHAT HE LIKES!  Until then he continues to go out and buy pies, burger buns, fish and chips, you name it (we have a lovely pie shop in the village) and come home to eat my meals AS WELL.  He is determined to get this medication which he thinks will solve his problem.I tried the surgery again, to get to speak to his GP but she refuses to even pick up the phone because of patient confidentiality.  I wonder if she'd read a letter ......?
