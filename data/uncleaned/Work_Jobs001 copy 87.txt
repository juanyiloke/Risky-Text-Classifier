Not sure how to approach________________________________________Ok I'm currently working a part-time job but I'm absolutely miserable in it. The hours are crap, I feel I'm usually not actually needed as the place usually actually isn't busy enough to justify having extra staff in. Anyway, I want to leave and start looking for something else. I'm not really sure how to approach the situation with my current employer though. Do I let them know I'm looking elsewhere and ask to use them as a referee on my CV? The thing is they've been good to me in the last few years in terms of finding me hours but I feel I've outgrown the place and no longer enjoy working there.
