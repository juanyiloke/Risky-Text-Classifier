This is a silly question but what happens when you die if you're a college student, I mean does the school find out you committed suicide? Do teachers tell students? Mine is a very small college, and I actually really loved it, and all the teachers know your name and go extra miles to help you. The reason I ask is just because I really don't want some of my classmates knowing. I mean I'll be dead it doesn't matter to me, but I don't want them to feel bad if they might. The one girl who was my friend who I fought with I think might feel guilty if she found out, and one more person I wasn't really friends with but she saw me upset one day and was caring I just wouldn't want anyone to feel sorry for me or feel bad themselves the semester is almost over so I just want to quietly disappear and no one will remember me by next semester when I'm not there.
