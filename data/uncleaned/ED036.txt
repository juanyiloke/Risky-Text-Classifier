I want to disappearLiving inside my mind is terrible. I am hard on myself to an unhealthy degree. I ridicule my body and am disgusted with myself for how I look. I have been in treatment twice now and I do well for a few months then I find myself right back in the binge/purge cycle. Everyday is a war against myself. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever rather than wake up to this hell in my head. I want to destroy this eating disorder and go on with my life. I feel stupid for sounding so pitiful. I am scared of living.
