 Uni Stress :(Hi guys, this might be a bit of a rant so if it is I apologise. It's not all ED related either but this is where I post the most and feel most comfortable. First I hope you're all okay  The main thing is that I've just started back at uni and it's my third year and I'm already so stressed out that I'm getting upset everyday. One of my courses is a specialist one so it goes on for the whole year and its different to what I thought it would be. The lecturer is very different and quite intimidating in a way as are the other students because they're doing straight history whereas I do history and American studies. It sounds odd I know but the history students are always really intimidating and you just feel so stupid and incompetent around them. I feel like I can't do the course properly and because it's such a long module I feel like it's going to have a massive impact on my final grade and I'm just going to fail. So then I get all the thoughts that tell me to just quit life because I'm only gonna screw it up anyway :/ plus I have to do my dissertation this year and I'm working and there are so many things to read that I feel like it's all piling up and I can't breathe. But, the last thing I was going to tell you all was that I got an email from uni telling me about a support group for students with EDs and although I wasnt going to go, I decided I will. Sorry this is so long  xx
