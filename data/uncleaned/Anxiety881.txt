Leaving people before they get the chance to leave meThrough my journey with anxiety/depression etc, seeing different counsellors have enabled me to notice quite a few things about myself.I just wanted to write down a paragraph or so about what's been on my mind tonight.I'm currently in a relationship. This is unusual for me (obviously). In the past, when I've been in relationships with boys, we've never done anything serious, nor did the relationships last longer than about 6 months.Thinking over this in therapy and to myself, I feel that this is due to my anxiety.I have such an irrational fear of being left on my own, that I think I'm leaving people before they get the chance to leave me first.Nowadays, I feel like everyone is going to leave me sooner or later (not just boyfriends), and waiting around for them to do so is so painful.I feel as if this may jeopardise my relationship. The man I'm with isn't exactly more mentally stable than myself - but he does a lot to make me comfortable. But the thought of him waking up one day and not liking me in whatever way haunts me everyday. It makes me want to end the whole thing before I can get hurt.Why am I so irrational!?
