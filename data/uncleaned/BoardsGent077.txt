EmploymentWhat’s people opinions on their partners who don’t work? Does/has it put strain on your relationship? I’m not talking about people who unfortunately lost their jobs and can’t find a new one but those who never bothered to look since out of school/college & are happy picking up their dole once a week. I’ve recently broke up with my partner due to them not working or even attempting to find employment. It put huge pressure on our relationship & I got to the point I was fed up having someone so dependent on me, paying for everything, being asked why I am I going to sleep at 12am, no understanding of house shares & being annoyed when I wanted time to myself. I think a job is necessary for both parties in a relationship, unless there is kids on the scene. Job satisfaction is worth it, not to forget the responsibility and independence it brings. Not to mention the better possibilities for the future with two incomes. So gentlemen, have you ever been in a relationship where your partner has never worked and if so how did it work out for you? If you haven’t, could you ever see a future if this was the case?
