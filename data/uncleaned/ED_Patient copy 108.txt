binge eatingi constantly eat in secret as much as i can before being with my friends. all my friends think i eat really healthy as they seee me eating salad and fruit at lunch but whilst in the community i will stop at shops buying two and three chocolate bars and eat them all at once. i constantly crave food from bread to fruit to crisps/ chocolate basically whatever i can get my hands on when i am by myself. i know its wrong and feel rubbish whilst doing it and even worse afters, i have bougght chocolate as a gift for someone else and then eaten it myself
