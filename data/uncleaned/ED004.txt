I don't want to be this personI know I have an eating disorder. I think about food way too much, the food I bing ate as well as the food I am 'too good' to even touch. When I restrict my eating, I feel superior, so powerful. When I feel hungry and can suppress and ignore it, I feel accomplished. I know this sounds insane. When I give into food however, depending on whether I am alone or not, I can control myself. To prevent my parents from noticing my screwed up eating habits I have learned to eat 'normally' around them. I show up to dinner and I eat like nothing was wrong, even though my portions always tend to be smaller than my parents and a second serving was never part of the package.When I am alone, I binge eat. I stuff it all in and can't stop. I believe it is, because nobody is there, nobody is watching, no one will ever know, therefore it doesnt count right? And I don't stop, not even when I'm beyond full, because when will I get another chance like this? Unfortunately I am home alone a lot. I tell myself I'm weak and I hate myself when it happens. The only thing that gets me back on track, back to trying, back to being who I actually am, is being active.I don't want to be this person, that lies to her parents about having eaten in town or at a friends....the one who says doesn't like certain foods, the one who lies to herself about not being hungry. I am not fat. But I am not good enough to live up to my own standards. Standards that I know are almost impossible to fulfil.I can take care of my restriction, once I am not in danger of binge eating anymore, because I know I am loved for just who I am. I am done missing out on my life, because I am either hating on myself, feeling exhausted and not having any energy or worse off all feeling so sick after binge eating. So any advise or suggestions as to how I can stop when I am full, anything at all. I would greatly appreciate any feedback.Thank you!!
