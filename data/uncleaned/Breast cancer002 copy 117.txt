HER2- negative.¥	I recently posted about my mums diagnosis of BC on this forum.¥	Today we had another appointment to find out more! The surgey has been canceled, because they said my mum has HER2- negative Cancer. Well we asked they didn't actually say, they just said my mum needs chemo first for 5 months and then surgery! I can't seem to find much online (might not be the best idea) about HER2-negative. It seems to be more about the +. Wondering if any of you ladies know more about it? We did try asking our Breast doctor but he didn't seem to wanna be too informative. Also we have another appointment to see an oncologist. What are the rate of success of treating this Cancer? I know everyone is different. ¥	 ¥	Love,¥	Mags¥	X
