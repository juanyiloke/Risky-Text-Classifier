What is going on??I was never diagnosed with an ED, so I'm not sure what I'm experiencing is a phase of a recovery; but I did have very VERY restricting eating habits, I was preoccupied with food, I got anxious around food and if I let myself have a little taste I would either a) lose all control and eat tons b) feel guilty about it and excercise OR restrict even more. I also missed periods and had an abnormal amount of hair loss. These were all last year though, until my body came to the point where it wouldn't go any further even if I pushed it to. I gained the weight back because of the binges the restricting led me to (this later turned into extreme hunger I think), then I started a new meal plan with a professional. I lost some of the weight but got stuck at one point, so I got frustrated and hit extreme hunger. I am constantly eating even though I'm not hungry, and I'm gaining weight. Very. Quickly.I was thinking maybe this might be because I interrupted a phase of recovery by changing eating patterns? I dont't know, I read in a lot of placed that extreme hunger during recovery is normal and expected, but I'm not even sure if I'm recovering right now (did I even have an ED in the first place?). I need reassurance whether I should go with my body's flow and eat intuitively (I don't know if I can). I'm so uncomfortable and sad :(
