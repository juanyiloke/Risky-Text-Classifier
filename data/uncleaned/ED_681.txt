First day of actively recovering from an undiagnosed eating disorderI know i have disordered eating and i need to change my behaviours and be more healthy. My GP knows the struggles i have with eating and she wants me to try. So i printed off some 'recovering from disordered eating' wookbooks. I am on the 5th one now. And it is about regular eating. I am having trouble working out what snacks would be good for evenings. Obviously i dont want anything too much because it will be a few hours before i go to bed. I just have no idea what would be considered a good snack at night. I often binge at night and i dont want to eat something that might trigger off those thoughts. Today i managed breakfast, a huge feat for me, as i know is common for a lot of people woth eating disorders. I didnt manage any other snacks or lunch but did manage a good dinner as well
