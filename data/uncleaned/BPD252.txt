Êhow do I seek help when I expect to be ignored?So I am depressed, going down hill but no one listens to me as they think I am crying wolf or something. I don't really know what's going on apart from them seeing my bpd and think my depression is just another mood swing for me to wait until its over. I have been to psychiatrist last seen in November but he said I need reassurance and exercise and already on a high dose of medication. He doesn't even record I have major depressive disorder anymore. I know I am worse now.I am scared of going to see him again to be told he cant help me, if they cant help me what is the point of carrying on. I want to go and say if you don't help me, change my meds. see me more frequently I will kill myself, but then he will just see that as a bpd thing, when I do actually mean it. how do I do this when I fear being dismissed so much?
