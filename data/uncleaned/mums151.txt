bit of background for you - I grew up in a Mediterranean household - eating was a big thing, all quite healthy but large portions etc. I was v active and fine till puberty hit and suddenly any puddings / sweets etc were completely banned, various diets were the norm even though looking back I was a little chubby but not big. I therefore went a bit mad and can remember sneaking foods etc. 30ish yrs later having lost 1stone ( I have never been v overweight but yrs of negative comments about my "piano legs"etc have meant a v skewed view of my body) and discovered running, I finally love how I feel and look. I have 2 gorgeous girls , eldest is 10 and starting to develop. I am batting away negative comments from DM re her "growing" and despite DM, DH and DSIL feeding up my children on a lot of "treats" they are pretty healthy looking. They know what is healthy and what shouldn't be eaten in great quantities, nothing is banned, they have fab self control around chocs etc - will ask then not take huge amounts despite it being available, don't have to clear plates etc. I am the one who keeps them active - swim lessons as is great life skill, one after school sport of their choice then I take them to roller disco with their friends and out biking/ in the park at weekends. My question is how do you promote a healthy attitude - I know things change as puberty hits, but I would hate to be the cause of years of a negative attitude to food/ poor body image in either of my daughters. I think that my skewed view on it all has the potential to impact on them - by the way I do eat normally, don't talk negatively about myself, and they know that I love going out for a run a couple of times a week, so don't think my behaviour in front of them is weird. I am thinking of having a general chat with my eldest soon re how the body changes in puberty etc so will add a bit about it being normal to put on weight in different parts of the body etc - what would you add?
