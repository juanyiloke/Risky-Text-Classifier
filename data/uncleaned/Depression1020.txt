Long Term Depression - No hope for the future - Feeling really down.Hello,I'm new and have never written on a forum before but thought I'd try it out.I'm 31 and have been suffering from depression and anxiety for over 15 years and just don't feel like I can continue fighting this forever. It has effected my life in so many ways, I have never been in a relationship as I feel unlovable and worthless and have never had the confidence to meet people, I binge eat and have put on so much weigh (40kg) I hate the way I look and don't like to leave the house much.ÊI had to leave my job in 2010 due to stress and depression and haven't worked since, I'm struggling financially and live with my parents......I feel like there is no hope for my future. I attempted suicide twice in 2014 and have been receiving treatment (psychologist & medication). But I don't thinks it's helping much.ÊPeople keep telling me that I'm to old to be living with my parents, that I should have a job, car, partner, kids etc and I should be in a better position at my age and I just feel like a failure.ÊÊI started studying a course in Feb, thinking it would be good for me to socialise and interact with people, but am already considering withdrawing as I'm so self conscious and it's so hard to get out of bed and go everyday, I don't know what to do anymore my life is falling apart and I can't get control of it.ÊJust wondering if anyone has been through similar experiences or has any advice that may be helpful.I want to get better but I've tried so many times and failed, I don't know if I'll ever be able to function normally again
