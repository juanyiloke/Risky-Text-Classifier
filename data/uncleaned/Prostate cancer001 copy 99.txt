Surgery or Radiotherapy - what to do?  In January I was diagnosed with locallyadvanced prostate cancer -Gleason 9, PSA 30, lymph nodes in the pelvic area and also moving up the paraarotic chain. Only good news is cancer has not spread to the bones.  My case was discussed at a Multi Disciplinary Meeting (MDW) and the recommendation was HT and possible RT.  In parallel I have also been in discussion with a surgeon who recommends removal of the prostate, continue with HT and possible RT later.  As I am new to this I am eager to hear from people that have gone down these different routes?  I have the Oncologist saying if it was me I would avoid surgery and the surgeon advising the operation could extend my life expectancy.  Help?
