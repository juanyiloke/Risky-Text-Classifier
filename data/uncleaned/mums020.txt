So im sat here browsing mumsnet and then i look down at my two youngchildrenplaying nicely on the floor. What am i doing, i should be playing with them??! And this is what im like, nearly everyday. I dont interact with my children as much as i should be. If they ask me, i will...i never say no. Its just they seem happier playing on there own and if i join in they lose interest. This is how a typical weekday goes...we get up, go downstairs. I make them breakfast and i watch tv while they eat it, once theyve finished they either ask to watch tv or they play, whilst i just sit here. They both go to school i need to be out for 12 to get them there, so i give thrm a quick lunch, not that theh ever eat it. I get them dressed and we go to school. Dont even brush teeth or wash face everytime. I know im being brutally honest here, and im doing it to try and shake out of this routine im in and be a better mummy. On a wednesday and friday mornings we have toddler groups and softplay weekly so we go to these...but every other morning runs the same as above. When they finish school if its nice i take them to the park for about 40 mins then come home, where once again they are left to there own devices why i make tea ect. I know i should be doing more with them, but what can i do with them on the mornings?? They start nursery at 12 so time is limited.Please, be as harsh as you like...i think i need it..x
