I have these spells that come out of no where . I was molested by my grandfather frm the time I was 5-10. I didn't tell anyone until I was twenty. Five memories exist in my head. I have flashbacks and after sex sometimes I curl up in a ball and cry. I also have hyper manic bipolar disorder, so I like trance out and become extremely deep, have no control of my emotions and enter like a complete different state of mind. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience and can relate and maybe help me with grounding tools. I have been to over five psychiatrist and am currently on lamictal and respirone. Has anyone with the mono of PTSD and hyper manic bi polar disorder has found a solution to even them out. All opinions would be greatly appreciated.Ê
