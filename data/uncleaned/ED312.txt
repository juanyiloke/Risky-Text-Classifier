ÊRelapseI went through bulimia when i was 16yrs old for about a year, and i recovered on my own. I understand all the risks and negative side affects but today, Six years later i've come to terms with the fact that I've relapsed. for the past three weeks i've been purging, but not so much bingeing, and it's the worst feeling not having anyone to go to for support. My friends who used to know about my ED, now all live in different cities/countries so we're not as close, and im too afraid to go to the doctors or therapist because I dont know how confidential they are as i DONT want my family finding out. Ive recently moved to a new country so im still in the process of making new friends which makes it even harder not having anyone to talk to about this.ÊI've worked my but off for so long excersizing and keeping a balanced diet but seeing zero results and im now at the point where i've hit rock bottom and dont know what to do. I know I need support and that I need to talk about, but not having anyone to go to, I guess this is the best place. I want this ED out of my life as its taking control of me again and its making me depressed on the inside.
