Have had asthma my whole life and nobody I know has it - in my family or friends. No one understands. Glad I found you. It is scary, scary, scary stuff - no one understand you could die in seconds. Anyway, I am so fortunate that mine has stabilized - I just stay away from what I am allergic to and I am ok. I love to run. I can't imagine that being taken away from me. I suffered through asthma when I played field hockey and ran track - but now that I am older I think it was the dust on the field and not the running. I was in the ER and sick with pneumonia and bronchitis so much of my childhood - it was horrible. Glad I found others who can understand.
