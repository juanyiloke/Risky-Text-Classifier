Êfeeling ignoredi have been in and out of hospital since i was young as a result of harming myself because i couldnt understand my own thoughts.I find public situations awkward and feel like everyone thinks i wierd..i panick and have suffered from anxiety attacks. I also feel like i dont know who.i am sometimes like i lost my personality along the way and i struggle tp remember what makes me laugh and what im about. i get really confused and sometimes sleep for days because i cant cop with my own.brain. I have seen so many ppl via the hospital but each time put into therapy for anxiety. i believe after reading about bpd that this is what i have but dont know if im write or npt. struggling tp.understand why this is happening n why im being ignored..just need some advice or someone to talk to atm. need them to understand that im going a bit mad and need to get and not waste my time. the proper help
