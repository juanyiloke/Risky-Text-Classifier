ÊEating disorder and hypoglycaemic attackJust wondering if anyone with an eating disorder has experienced a hypoglycaemic attack. I'm told that I'm at physical risk cos of my ECGs due to my eating disorder but I had a hypo last night for the first time and I don't know how I'm gonna manage found if I have an eating disorder. My psychotherapist was really concerned when I told her today and wants my CPN to know and they're saying that I'm at this serious risk and want bloods done, regular ECGs, want me up at the GP, etc and I don't want to connect to my body. But the hypo really wasn't nice as I felt suddenly ill and only got relieved when I had some apple juice. How on earth am I'm meant to regulate my eating? Just bleugh bleugh bleugh xx
