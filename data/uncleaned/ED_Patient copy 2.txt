I think I have an eating disorder, can anybody help?Hi, i'm 17 and I think I have had an eating disorder my entire life, I'm not sure if it can be classed as an eating disorder as I've never told a doctor about it before, and the only people who know about it are my close family. I find it really embarrassing to talk about and despite the fact that i'm actually fairly healthy (I weigh 7.5 stone which is the ideal weight for my height, and as far as I know i'm healthy), it is starting to worry me.When I was 2 or 3 years old, I would eat anything, I wasn't fussed at all, and then suddenly I just stopped. I don't know why, I just did. Now all I eat is junk food, the only vegetable i'll eat is lettuce and I rarely touch a fruit unless it's in the form of juice. The only meat I eat is chicken breast, so every night I tend to eat chicken or pizza with chips, or something a long those lines. Every night. I know, it's not healthy and I hate myself for it. But I get tearful when someone asks me to try something new and it's just pathetic. I can't go out for meals with my friends and I just can't talk to anyone about it. I don't know if there is anyone in a similar condition to me but it's starting to rule my life and I need advice.
