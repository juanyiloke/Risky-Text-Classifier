I an Concerned, Grand daughter missed her Brown inhalerPosted 3 months agoHimy grand daughter has a blue inhaler which she takes when needed.She also has a brown one  (Preventer i think it is called, steroids)I am concerned because her mother and partner and her father are not too bothered if she does not take it. I noticed her inhaler was at my house, it was left here the night before, so i know she did not have it that night, but also she did not have it in the following morning, and she has P.E. at school today. (she is 4 years old). She does get quite ill, and out of breath if she does not have the brown inhaler.I told her mother she has the inhaler here, i offered to take it to her school, but she told me NO.I am in a difficult possition, if i take it, then i will not she my grand daughter at all. But i want to know is it ok for her to miss her inhaler for the night and following morning?thank you
