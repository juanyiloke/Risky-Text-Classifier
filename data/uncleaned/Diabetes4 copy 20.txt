Resumption of MetfartinI am fed up of Metformin SR.  My after evening meal figures are awful 9 - 12 far too often but not every night.  I am going back to Spain soon and don't know if they even do extended Met.  I have had a prolonged IBS flare up and tbh the constipated feeling is driving me mad.  Diarrhoea is my usual 'gift' and of the two I'd prefer the Diarrhoea  I've also put up weight which for me is a no no.  Tried to get an appointment with my doc and no such luck.  Went to my DSN this week but she was so abrupt I didn't dare talk about changing my medication.  I can do it myself but does anyone have any opinions/tips on how to make it seamless.  .
