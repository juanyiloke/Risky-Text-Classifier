Asked to do work by another manager________________________________________Hi,Just going anonymous for this. I'm currently splitting time between two teams in work, but I still report to the manager I've always had and get assigned work from her barring the one task I'm working on with the other team. Now one of the managers on the other team has asked me to do something outside what I do on my original team or the task I'm working on in the new team. That job is generally dealt with by a different team but they're backlogged atm, and can't get to it. When asked by him, I said yes (I'm really bad at saying no even when I know I should be), and started it a bit before deciding I should cover myself incase I'm left out to hang later on, so I mentioned it to my original manager, who said I should not be doing that work, other manager was going around the established process in the company and I or the team would not be able to stand by the work as being properly done. Did I do the right thing? Should I have just gone and completed the task (I can do it, just company policy is any information going external has to be validated by a data validation team) or should the other manager never have asked me to do it without having it cleared?Just makes it awkward as I work with him and his team on other stuff, and not sure have I messed that relationship up by reporting to my original manager.
