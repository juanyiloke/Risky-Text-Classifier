Appealing disciplinary________________________________________I have come through a disciplinary in work and gone through appeal process which resulted in a final written warning which stays for 1 yr on file. If I appeal this via Employment Appeals Tribunal what is best case scenario for me as I want to know if it is worth doing.I have been out of work with stress due to this and got paid for 4 weeks but last 3 weeks have not got paid so on sick benefit. So if I won via Employment Appeals Tribunal what would I hope to achieve in monetary terms aswell as decision of final written warning been overturned. Can you receive compensation for stress caused by disciplinary if overturned by Employment Appeals Tribunal Just want to know if worth it,,
