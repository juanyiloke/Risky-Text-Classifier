DS will be 3 in September, and is going through a biting stage at nursery, which has been happening for the last couple of weeks. They put him in timeout when this happens, and I talk to him about how it's better to walk away from someone if he doesn't want them near him. I've tried getting angry with him, and saying it makes me sad, but it doesn't seem to help.I have decided to try a different approach, and wanted opinions on if this is a good idea, or if I should try something else.ÊI made a big deal today about a (very simple!) reward chart. I have told him that if over the next 3 days he doesn't bite, he gets a tick for each day. If he has 3 ticks at the end of the week, he will get a special treat. I'm planning on repeating this in the morning, so it's fresh in his mind when he goes in. Any other ideas? DS knows that he is in the wrong, I think he doesn't understand how to get someone to leave him alone, so bites instead. I know this is no excuse, which is why I'm hoping the above works.I did have a miscarriage last month, but not sure how much he understands, but that is the only major thing that has happened recently. I'm wondering if he has picked up on that maybe?
