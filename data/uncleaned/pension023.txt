Mad Cow's DiseaseWhen I was having a pre-op medical last year, a nurse asked me if I had ever had Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.Ê I looked at her quite blankly so she qualified by saying it used to be known as mad cow's disease.Ê ÊI said I knew what it was but asked how would I know.Ê Because I would be dead, or if it was dormant I wouldn't know.Ê ÊShe just said I probably hadn't but the question was on the points sheet and then we both went on to other things.I have often thought about this little incident and looked it up in a very superficial way.Ê ÊApparently absolutely lots of us are infected and will never know.Ê ÊI am thinking this could be a bigger scandal than the Penrose inquiry. And wondering if a proportion of Alzheimers diagnoses could be down to this.ÊIn my case I didn't need a blood transfusion [I think they would have told me if I had - wouldn't they?] and I was a blood donor twice only.Ê I did eat a lot of fillet steak though.But this is something I have mostly ignored over the years and I am wondering if anyone has any information on this.
