Toxic co-workers?2012-12-22, 03:21 PMFor me, half the part of a job is getting along with your co-workers. I was recently moved to another area of my department to assist with a project for a few months. My manager put myself and another co-worker I know there together because we had got along so well. For whatever reason, maybe its because we're always around each other now, my co-worker has become extremely annoying. Once more, she constantly bitches about other people we work with and the project itself. I also get the sense that she talks about me behind my back. Since she talks about everyone else behind their backs, I can only assume that she talks about me.This is someone I could have been friends with I believe, if we had not been moved to this project together. So I'm not sure if she's unhappy in her new area or if she just never was a good person to begin with.Any advice?
