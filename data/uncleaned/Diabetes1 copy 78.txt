I've done something sillyI was checking my feet, and found I couldn't feel my toe tip on my right foot, next to my big toe. So then I noticed hard skin and thought hat must be why. So I got the foot filer out on it and scrubbed until soft. Then I could feel a tap on it again. BUT now, ten mins later... It's starting to really hurt! I obv scrubbed too much but didn't feel it!!Does this mean I have neurothapy? Or am I ok because I can feel the pain? I felt nothing when filing and it's not red
