Just got cross with the nine year old. I also have a 14 year old who is away at the moment and an eleven year old. They have a job chart with one or two jobs a day to do. Jobs are clean and set the table before and after meals, sweep the kitchen floor, empty the dishwasher and give the cats fresh water twice a day.ÊJobs are not always done. When they are done sometimes not good enough though I know they could do better as it is done right though I have asked four times to do so at times. Huge sighs from them. Constantly putting things in the wrong place even though the pots have lived there for years and I have shown them time and again.ÊNine year old shouted a job was the 14 year olds, clearly not willing to do an extra job while he's out.ÊMy house is a tip. It is in need of a clean. I'm forever picking up after them and I have had enough. This morning he's had cereal in the lounge and has left his bowl there. It would stay there until I moved it or reminded him too.ÊAt these ages I was hoovering, ironing, shopping , cleaning and while that was an abusive situation I do feel my children should be able to sweep the floor properly and get better at it.ÊI've said I won't be taking him to the library today as I'm so annoyed and in my anger I'm thinking I'll just clean the house and ignore him and he can whistle for TV and computer today.
