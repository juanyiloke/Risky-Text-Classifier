URGENT: Accepted the Job but have another interview.2014-02-25, 09:24 AMSo, I just got a job offer. This is my #1 choice from all the companies I'm looking at. We are going to hash out some details later today but I am willing to accept the offer as is if they don't negotiate.The catch, I have an interview scheduled for tomorrow. This was set up through a friend and they already booked me in a hotel (400 mile drive). Do I respectfully back out of the interview with less than 24 hours notice or do I just go to the interview?
