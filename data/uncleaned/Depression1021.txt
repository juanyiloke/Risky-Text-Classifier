New here and just looking for some advice and supportHi all, I just wanted to share how I've been feeling in the hope that I can get some advice or tips. I'm a 39 year old male and I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for which I've been seeing a psychologist, but I don't think she's really helping. I'm no expert on depression but mine pretty much feels like a constant feeling of demotivation, lack of interest and enthusiasm in everything from hobbies and interests to social outings. I'm not eating properly and I feel tired most of the time and just want to sleep or lounge around. I can barely get out of bed in the morning to work in a job that I can just put up with in a company that's been going through a restructure over the last 18 months. I'm in the middle of building a house and the uncertainty of job security is not helping. I'm being forced to apply for roles at work that I don't really want and I've started to feel worse with feelings of uselessness and hopelessness creeping in. I've recognised the majority of the way I feel is work related but I've always had a feeling of flatness anyway and a lack of goals or direction. I've spoken to friends and family but don't want to burden them too much and thought this website might be a good place to connect with others. Would appreciate any advice on how to manage this or pull myself out and get back into life again. 12
