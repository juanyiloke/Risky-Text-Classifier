Just got back from doctorsWell just got back from doctors and as you can guess the news was bad. I wish for once it was "hey guys guess what, it was nothing to worry about and that swelling will go down in a couple of days" It was looks like it's grown some, to which I asked what can be done.....response was......not much we will try another chemo next week.....I ask what about the size and the pain......response .....morphine.......amputation. I love this guy, Going to try CTCA if my insurance will cover, I'm not ready to give up on my best friend yet and she's not ready either. I find myself when I'm away from her just a bundle of tears that wont stop and I can't bear the thought of my life without her. As always Johnhttp://www.cancerforums.net/threads/31280-Just-got-back-from-doctors
