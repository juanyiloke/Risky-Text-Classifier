Abuse in Care HomesJust watched 1.30 pm. news on ITV......  ......DID ANYONE ELSE?   Very distressing to see patients in a particular care home treated so badly by staff there.   Someone must have filmed what went on - fortunately.    The outcome was the people concerned ended up in court in Bristol.   It can't be the easiest of jobs, and maybe staff are poorly paid.   This does not, and will never  excuse the way patients were treated.   What is the answer to make sure things like this won't happen again, behind closed doors.    Lot's of worrying situations are being brought to the publics notice receently, and solutions are badly needed by the powers that be, and the public to be kpt informed.
