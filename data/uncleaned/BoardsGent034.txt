Single father need opinionsHeyJust looking to see if anyone is in a similar situation, currently out of a 6 year relationship and it feels like a constant battle with my ex over my child and other issues. So far she has missed pick up times e.g said she would pick our child at 11 and doesn't turn up till 3, done this 4 times so far in the space of 4 month split.Contently ringing with issues such as car problems.Decides to tell me she is seeing someone as is a considerate but yet she screws me on everything else.Tells me im not seeing my child enough even do its three times a week and every saturday.Basically does this battle go on for long? Anyone else in a similar situation that we can feel sorry for each other?Valentines day brings out so much emotion
