ÊHave I got an eating disorder?Hi,Please could somebody advise me about the issue of eating disorders? I have a problem where I am underweight and I want to gain weight, but I am afraid of eating too much food.Over the last year I have lost quite a lot of weight due to some big changes in that have occurred in my life. My weight has gone down.My eating habits have changed quite a lot in this time and I am now more conscious of the foods that I eat. I also think I might have developed some distorted ideas about food and this causes me to worry about eating too much.I have been to the doctors but they told me that nothing is wrong but I am still losing weight and this is causing me to be worried.
