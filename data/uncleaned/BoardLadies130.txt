YO YO Dieter Queen!Why do we do it to ourselves!! how can I get off this horrible yo yo rollercoaster of diets!ÊAt this stage I'd say I've lost about 1-2 stone at least 10 times or more!I'm having a particularly bad run of things at moment and I do tend to eat more when stressed.When I know I'm a stress/emotional eater why do I still do it?ÊEvery day for the past few months I've said to myself ok tomorrow I swear I'll get into it!! today literally one top fitted me properly out of my whole wardrobe and I swore after my big dinner at the folks today that it! but I just can't get back into it at all.ÊI quite enjoy walking and I play sports once or so a week and have started the c25k but i suffer with my back and the more weight i have on the worse my back is so affects me exercising! its a vicious circle that i created myself!ÊI'm by no means huge 12-14 but could do with losing a good 2 stone, even my bras are cutting into me..Anyone break the yo yo curse have advice for me??!
