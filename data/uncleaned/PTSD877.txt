ÊTired of being the crazy oneToo sensitive. I struggle everyday to get out of bed. My trauma happened 20 years ago but my husband leaving me for his lesbian coworker did me in. To make matters worse, his newly converted whore set her son up with my 18 yr old pregnant daughter. Now i really have no role in their lives except to be the unpaid babysitter. I cant. I cant. Im disabled for a reason. My daughter sees me as insane yet capable of watching my grandbaby for free.ÊIm done. The pain of seeing their newly created family dynamic is too hard for me. His family was all i had for 18 years of marriage. Now they drop me for his alcoholic lesbian convert.ÊI have no one. I want to die. Or kill. Kill them for leaving me.
