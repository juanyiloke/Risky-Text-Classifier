D review with the new practice nurse.Just had a D review with the new practice nurse.         Lipids :-OK under 4 but didn't go into breakdown ( I had them from "bloods" printout for consultant!)HbA1c :- dangerously low @ below 6 ! WTF!   Couldn't justify but It's advice from "learned researchers"   Can I hand write BG in a diary as she doesn't "get on" with computers   NO I will do a printout summary as with with my stroke injury "I don't do writing" for lazy P.N.sKidney function is low ( actually improving!)So I'll carry on relying on surgery for scripts alone, not sensible advice!   To top it all my Collie pup was so excited to see me back intact that SHE wee'd in my boot STANDING UP   (I don't remember teaching her THAT!) Good aim. all in the boot, none or the patio!
