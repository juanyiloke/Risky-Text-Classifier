feeling really really down dont want to be hear anymore My husband a couple of weeks ago for a 22 year old he was having an affair with her under my roof she is carrying his child which she conceived under my roof while I was asleep how could he after 27 years of marriage. he use to wcatch things on TV at his mums about people who had affair and he said our wedding vows ment the world to him and how could anyone do something like that to someone the loved and were married to and he wouldn't ever do that to me. And the woman if you can call her that called me mum and him dad and now look she is carrying his baby. What am I support to do now I am disabled and my one true love is now in love with a22 year old I just don't want to carry on living with out him he was my rock my world my soul mate and now he's gone each and every day gets harder and harder I carnt live like this
