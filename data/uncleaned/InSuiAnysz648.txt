Dear _______I'm writing this just to tell you that I love you. I always have and I always will Of all the times we said that to each other; whether apologising, rushing quickly to work, or snuggling together, I want you to know that I meant every single one...But now, it seems you've grown out of me, and if I'm honest, I think you're really mature for doing so. You can never be happy with me, and I hope you find it somewhere. There are absolutely no words I could use yo describe you. You're more than good; more than fun; more than intelligent; more than caring. And I more than love you. Lately, I've been feeling a new kind of empty. I feel like the hole I usually feel has become bigger, to the point where I can barely breathe. I'm tired of crying, and I'm tired of wishing for us to get back together, I know it'll never happen. I'll be the story you tell to your husband or boyfriend when you first connect. I'll be a piece of your past; a weird stage if your life, rather than the light of it, which I tried so hard to be. I don't want you to be upset with my decision. Please understand that it's something that isn't your fault. I have just come to a point where I can no longer stand to be around. I hope, with all my being, that you can forgive me, and that you can move on with your life, and meet someone who makes you feel as happy as we had made each other at one time...Goodbye ______, thank you...For everything. Yours, forever, ______ xxxxxxx
