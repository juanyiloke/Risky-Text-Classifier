Timelord Victorious; Or My Darkest SideSo, bear with me, this introduction is difficult for me. It feels very ... private. I also am drinking my fifth beer right now, which becomes important later on."Timelord Victorious?" you might ask. "Wtf is that?" It is a plotline in the british sci-fi show Doctor Who, that I love alot. It helped me to accept PTSD before I even knew it was a thing, because it is a big point of the characterization. I strongly relate to stories, they were my true caregivers when I was a little child and, then, a bigger child. The parents i never had. It is really lovely done, and I strongly believe it saved my life. Anyway...The Doctor is the kindest, smartest, most brilliant man (well; Alien. He is from a race called the Timelords. He travels through time and space with a timemachine he "borrowed") one could imagine. He knows suffering, and thus wants to help end it. In the beginning of the "restart" of the show, 2005, he obviously suffers from PTSD. The one in the clip I would like you to watch is another Doctor, the next regeneration. The Doctor does not die, he regenerates, into a different personality and a different body. Now I know, why I so immensly strongly reacted to this series and the concept of regeneration, people with dissociative symptoms of PTSD can relate, I hope. The Doctor in the clip is the 2nd of the restart of the series, and the actor strongly, in my opinion, portrayed the wish to be freed from the past, without actually having processed it. He was childish and angry. No forgiveness, no understanding, just supression.
