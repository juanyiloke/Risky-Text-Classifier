Did I enter your world, briefly?Hello Friends,I started taking Mirapex a few weeks ago to combat Restless Leg Syndrome. I was started at a low dose (0.125mg/d) and it seemed to cut down on the severity of the RLS events -I wasn't jumping out of bed at 3am like I was on fire... My PCP okayed bumping the dose up to 0.250mg/d and that is when some strangeness began to take hold. Over several days my brain felt like it had a white noise machine blaring in the background, I was flooded with racing thoughts, my speech was disorganized, I couldn't arrange my thoughts, and I was completely flustered and unable to solve the most mundane problems. I also had trouble understanding what people were saying to me and even several emails with my Shrink I couldn't seem to explain what was happening to me -it was gibberish on the screen, rambling nonsense, and I had to tell him that I also didn't understand a word he was writing in return. about 3-4 days ago I stopped the Mirapex completely and I seem to be coming back to a world I can function in, though I still a few brown outs here and there.... It is believed by my shrink that that Mirapex, being a Dopamine agonist working on D2 receptors threw me into Acute Psychosis. I was knocking on door of Schizophrenia. I'm a little embarrassed to tell my PCP about this because I pushed him to let me try Mirapex since I was sure the Dopamine hit would yield all sorts of positive changes. My PCP was 'hesitant' about any 'activating' drugs due to my anxiety and panic attacks. I would really like to try it again to be 100% certain that I can pin the blame on the added Dopamine activity. Do you guys think it would be a bad idea or dangerous for me to test the theory? Would reopening that Psychotic door (wormhole) cause me any lasting or permanent damage?
