Choices to make re going for promotion________________________________________Folks,Not so much a work problem, more like decision to be made.I'm currently in the very lucky position to hold a permanent job that I really enjoy. Salary is very good 75K. My wife works full time also.I've received some encouragement to apply for another job within the organisation. Salary would start at 80k and rise to 100k after 4 or 5 years.I need to give them an answer on this.My current job has 30 days annual leave, so would the promotion. With my current job, it's accepted that overtime would be given back as time in lieu. With the new job, the hours would increase significantly and you wouldn't get the time back. It would also involve a lot of travel around the country and possibly abroad as well, whereas my current job has only a small amount of travel around the country.I also have a young daughter, very lucky to be able to drop her to school most days and collect her most days. That would be gone with the new job.The only positive I can see with the new job is the extra money, with bills to pay, it looks attractive.So should I stay as I am or go for it?
