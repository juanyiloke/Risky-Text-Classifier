Asthma Confusion  7  I hardly have asthma attacks and if i do its only due to the environment im in such as dust or extremely cold humid weather. ive been diagnosed with asthma since i was born. and recently i went to doctor checkup and they gave me seretide as a preventive for daily use. but i feel its unecessary and recently the past few days ive been feeling a little weird in my lung / breathing kind of thing. like it could potentially lead to an asthma attack. so im not sure if i should still take the seretide or just continue perhaps because its adjustment ??
