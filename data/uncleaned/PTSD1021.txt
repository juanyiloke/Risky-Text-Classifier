I've been dealing rather successfully with my Complex-PTSD for about a year and a half now after being rescued from a highly abusive relationship (a team of detectives managed to get me out and keep me safe during the trial. He's serving 6 years in prison now for my multiple beatings, confinement, rapes, strangulation, and threatening to kill me and burn down my house). Recently, I took on a full-time job again and I'm having a hard time dealing for one reason: it is an office in the basement (ground floor) level of the boss' house - upstairs is his family. Today, his teenage son was SCREAMING at his mother. This is the first time I've heard such a conflict (male/female) and while it was brief, it was intense, and my PTSD is activated beyond belief. The boss is away on a trip so I can't mention this occurrence to him. Also, no one here knows about my past and I really don't want to get into it with them unless I have to.... My question is this: does anyone have any experience in approaching employers to explain having PTSD? If so, how did that go? Or, should I not say anything unless it happens again and hopefully, he will be there to hear it. I'm having a hard time thinking clearly at the moment and my usual "calming tools" are not working for me. I just want to cry, run away, and hide. The argument has been over for about an hour now, but I'm still in flight mode; every time I hear a noise I almost bolt out of the door. Anything anyone can say is helpful at this point... Even knowing there is someone out there that can understand where I'm coming from is helpful...
