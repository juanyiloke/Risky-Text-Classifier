Advice pleaseAs some of you may know for the last 14 months I've been really suffering with a debilitating condition that's been affecting my stomach and bowels, but AT LAST I think we've found a diagnosis, looks like I have Malabsorption. Having more tests (on top of the new tests I'm having because of my lungs!) I've been looking at diets and supplements I can take to help with the symptoms and I've been advised to eat small and frequent meals (5-6 per day) this may be a silly question, I was wondering if I still carry on with my current insulin regime (breakfast, lunch and dinner injections) or do I now spread it out between 5-6 meals?x
