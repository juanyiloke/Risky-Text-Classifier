Why Arent The Criterion A Traumas The Focus Of My ThoughtsHello,I am not feeling too well right now, so I hope I manage to communicate well. I am in a very confused state right now, so apologies. There is something I do not understand about myself and my symptoms. In the process of writing and thinking about my trauma diary I found out I have, so very suprising to myself, several criterion A traumas. Why did I have to search for them for so long, they were buried deep, and why do they not occupy more place in my "worries" and recurring thoughts? They surface violently and vanish rapidly, so that I would not have ever pieced my life together without starting the trauma diary. I mostly focus on the emotional abuse and bullying that my grandmother, the caregiver most of my life, did. I suffer from PTSD with dissociative symptoms, as of yet still undiagnosed. It feels so wierd, that her behaviour feels like the worst that happened to me, but is in fact not responsible for the PTSD. The experiences that qualify as criterion A can feel insignificant compared to my hate for my grandmother. I often have a hard time remembering the traumas. I dont really feel the pain of them, and it feels like i never did, but when I was a teenager tried to kill my grandmother. What is going on?
