I loathe the word "Mummy", can just about get my head around "Mammy" (I'm Irish, so grew up with that), but think I will simply stick with my own name. OH thinks that's odd, though both of us call our fathers by their given names and think nothing of it.ÊI'm curious as to how many of you are called by your own name, or if anyone's older kids have switched from "Ma" to "Eileen". This is my first baby and the first grandchild for either set of grandparents, and I imagine that all four grandparents would like to be called by their own names.
