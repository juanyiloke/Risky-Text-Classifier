 Tutorial- anxietyby Maddie678Basically, I missed two of my three personal tutor meetings over the course of this year. I get very anxious about most things in life (I've been to the doctors several times over the past few years for it) and I went and just almost had a nervous breakdown waiting to go into one. I know this is detrimental to my career.My attendance is poor because of how anxious I get in situations when Im in close proximity to other people. Just, asking for peoples advice. I think I need to meet with him, but I'd like to explain the most of it in an email to him as I'm not sure I could get it out in person. Advice on how and what to write would be really much appreciated. This is all very stressful.Also, not sure this is in the right forum but meh. Thanks
