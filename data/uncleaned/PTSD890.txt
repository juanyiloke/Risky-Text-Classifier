ÊEMDR experiencesHi everybody, at last something seems to be happening, as last thursday I got to see my PTSD therapist and she mentioned the possibility of being given EMDR.ÊI have read about it, and would like to know of anyones positive experiences of EMDR.I am not asking for people to just say "it didn't work for me"more of the "It improved me because of ................"I have been warned that the therapy may threaten to resolve parts of my traumatic memory that I do not want to lose. By this I mean that because of my PTSD is related to both physical pain, and being in love. I have mixed pain and love totally, and whereas I want the pain bit to be gotten rid of, I have no wish for the loving part to go as well.any help?
