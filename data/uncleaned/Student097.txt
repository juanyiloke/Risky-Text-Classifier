Uni in Essex or Sussex? Help!by apettersen0Hello everybody. I am a norwegian student and I will begin my undergraduate year this autumn. I've gotten quite a few offers, and I am wondering whether I should go at the university in Essex (Colchester) or Sussex (Brighton).My question is if there are any happy students at any of the universities I mentioned and could tell me a bit of the student life, if there are any sports team I could join or gyms nearby, what the costs are and how the university is in general, also how the cities are, is it easy to get there etc?I would appreciate it so, soo much if any of you lovely people out there would answer.
