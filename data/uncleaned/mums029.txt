Has been happily wearing all sorts of cardigans for years, since birth, but now apparently they're either too big, too small, too long, too short, too tight, too loose, and I have had enough with the dictating. She tried it again this morning. I know it's just her trying to assert control so I snapped and told her if she couldn't grow up and behave herself and wear the correct uniform like everybody else in the school has to then she wouldn't be going to the sports club after school today. It's a one off trip to the playing field for her class to do some extra sports stuff. Not a big thing but most of the class are going. She looked a bit put out but we get a lot of that. I am always sanctioning TV, reading time, treats etc in an effort to curb this type of behaviour. She is very dominant and self assured and strong willed. Clearly it's not working, she's still very assertive and determined to do as she pleases, but I now feel really mean. She's been looking forward to the sports club. Was I too hasty or should I stick to my guns?
