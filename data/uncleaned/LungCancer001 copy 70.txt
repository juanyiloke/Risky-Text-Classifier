Lung cancerHiI have just been told I have lung cancer . They are telling me I will have to have my right lung removed also three ribs removed. I have not heard of the ribs being removed before ,but it was explained to me that the tumer had attached itself to my ribs. Now I know it will upset my family, but how can I break it gently to them, they are all grown up and have there own family , I don't want them fussing over me and making me feel guilty, but I know I must tell them sometime. So tomorrow will be the day, my wife knows of course so she will be a great help. Wish me luck.Brian
