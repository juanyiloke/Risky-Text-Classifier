Big decisions and finding the strength to start overHi I'm so sorry to post I have been trying not to but everything is caving in around me and I'm too fat and don't deserve to breathe but I'm trying to reach out. I'm struggling with feeling fat and worthless but things have declined and I feel so unsafe. The flashbacks are awful and it is hard to be grounded. I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts as I'm so fat and I feel invaded on every level. I am polluting myself if I eat so I must stay clean. My body isn't normal and nobody understands. I am a monster. My eating disorders nurse has suggested step up at the Bethlem but it failed the last time. I take up too much space and what I have a space that someone who is very ill needs and because of me they die? On one level I know I need to try again but I'm exhausted and conflicted. I'm sorry this makes no sense.
