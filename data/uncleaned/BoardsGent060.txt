Hernia surgery waiting listHas anyone here had surgery for a hernia recently? I feel I might have one - going to the doctor tomorrow to get it checked, but would like to know how long roughly the waiting list is as I was hoping to go travelling in the not too distant future! I don't have health insurance unforunately.An idea of what the surgery is like would be nice as well, so I'd like to hear people's experiences of it if you've ever had it done.
