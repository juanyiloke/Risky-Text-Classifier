Tooth Decay, Prednisilone and inhalers damaged teeth Hi,I am looking for some help or experience others may have had.I have been on steroid inhalers for 29 years and oral prednisilone tablets for 11 years (9 years continuously now). I have always had very good teeth with no need for fillings or any work done at the dentist except for fixing a tooth I got knocked out playing sport.The problem now is that suddenly my teeth are almost crumbling. I thought I always looked after them pretty well and brush them twice a day use mouth wash after taking my steroid inhalers and flossing etc. In the last month one tooth has totally crumbled and three others are starting to.I have a massive fear of the dentist ever since I had my tooth repaired when I got it knocked out. I always go for my check ups and never anything needs done.Has anyone else had experience of problems with teeth after a long time on inhaled or oral steroids. I need the steroids to keep my chest as well as possible but I don't want to be losing my teeth as a result.Would appreciate any help or advice etc.ThanksjustTUX
