Suffering from bulimiaHi everyone, I'm completely new to this forum - I've never used a health forum or psychiatric support forum before. I think I've been too scared because when so many of the people close to you judge you, attack you or abandon you because of your mental illnesses, it's hard to believe that total strangers won't do the same thing.Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself as I hope to have the confidence to use this forum as an outlet for all the awful stuff I keep bottled up inside, which causes me to hurt myself so badly. I'm in my early 20s, and I've suffered from bulimia for just over 6 years now. I have a few other serious psychiatric conditions (I became ill when I was 12 & went through a trauma) including OCD, Borderline Personality Disorder, & a history of psychotic episodes. Self-harming in various ways kind of runs my life, as do certain compulsive behaviours & I feel like I'm trapped in this life sometimes.As regards my eating, which is what I'm really here to talk about, the bulimia kind of goes in cycles - from mild, right round to severe & then back. I don't know if that makes any sense? At the moment I can feel it spiralling out of control again into the really severe stage. I am terrified to eat- actually have anxiety attacks any time I have to eat (i.e. at family meals, or out with friends so they don't pick up on the fact I'm trying to limit my food intake) I'm so mixed up - I feel guilty if I do eat, and then I feel guilty about starving myself & making myself throw up after I eat, or taking lots of laxatives. I just wanted to know I have a place to come to vent about some of this stuff because I'm suffering so much & I can't do this on my own.
