Will non asthmatics peak flow change?________________________________________When sick? A few months ago my primary had me do a peak flow test and I scored 350. She said my ideal should have been 410 but that I was fine and within normal range. I felt fine at the time, just some irritated sinuses due to allergies (which she also said might of contributed to the lower number). Today I had to go to urgent care for a sinus infection. Once again they had me blow into the tube. I scored a 310 on my best reading. I have been out of breath lately which is why they had me test. No comment what so ever by the doctor. So... Assuming it's fine? Any clue to what's the point of testing me over and over if nothing is going to be said about it? Is it normal for non asthmatics to be this affected by a sinus infection?
