death wish/survivorsi am very grateful (to God? to my parents? to myself?...) for the life i have had. so i'm not bitter or anythingi tend to not be depressed, the closest i feel to that is when i am boredanyway i really want to kill myself ... but i wouldn't (at least for now) b/c i have unfinished business but more importantly b/c of the effect it would have on my parentsso i am postponing my death wish indefinitely, basically. feel i have to stay around to keep my parents company, protect my mother if my father dies, that sort of thingi strongly relate to the study talked about in this science article:http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0219095325.htmso really i feel i don't have much of a purpose on the material plane anymore ... i'm not having children, i guess i could have a satisfying career ... but i'm not like other ppl, i'm an ugly little goblin man (i like to think ugly cute, but still...), so i don't plan on having much of a love life ...so i'm not entirely sure why i'm reaching out. do any of u old ppl think there is more to life? i just don't c the purpose of living if it's just going to be grinding and me deteriorating from being my best self rather than learning anything new and improving
