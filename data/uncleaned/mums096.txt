I have read several comments on nits which say that using a nitty gritty comb only adds 5 minutes to a normal hair wash.ÊWhaaaaat?! It takes me about 45 mins to do one child's head, and I have four of them to do. Maybe I am slow because my daughters have long (but fine) hair, and maybe I am slow because I am paranoid about getting every hair, but seriously, five minutes?! And then they say you should do this every two days?! Any life I have would totally disappear.ÊSo, utterly fed up that my kids have had nits for three weeks and I can't seem to get rid of them, what is my next step. The pharmacist says Vamousse - anyone tried it? Still have to comb, sigh, but hopefully getting the little suckers where it hurts at the same time.ÊOh - any advice on combing v gratefully received. How do you 'section the hair'? Do you go front to back, left to right, do I need to comb their eyebrows?! I need them GONE. Yeuch.
