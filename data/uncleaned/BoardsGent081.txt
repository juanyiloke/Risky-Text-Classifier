Marriage in today's society: is it worth it for men?Can other younger posters give their opinions and expectations of what they think of marriage nowadays and if it's a choice you'll consider yourself in the future either out of your own choice or societal pressure as it's the "thing to do"?Can older posters with all kinds of experience, happily married and divorced etc., give their opinions and suggestions?
