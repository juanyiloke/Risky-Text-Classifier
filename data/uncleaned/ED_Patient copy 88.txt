HELP????for a while now, I've been feeling like i might have an eating disorder. i've always been a fussy eater, and for a while have noticed that i'm constantly thinking about food during the day. when i get home from school, no-one is home, which gives me the perfect opportunity to eat loads of food, but i feel really guilty about it afterwards, although I've never made myself sick after I've eaten.recently, I've noticed just how thin i am, and it's making me paranoid. i think that everyone is constantly thinking about how thin i am when they look at me. it's really getting me down, as i want to get help and get better, but i don't really know who to talk to as i don't have a good home/family situation at the moment.what should i do???? please help!!!
