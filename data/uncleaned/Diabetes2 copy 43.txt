Kelson with type one diabetes  7  I was diagnosed with type one diabetes in 2004. No one in my mother's family has shown a sign of it in the 2 generations in Canada or back in Europe. I'm not sure of my father who was a Kelson. His parents emigrated in the early 1900's. No one here in his line has shown type one diabetes except me. I saw the Jeffery Kelson link to diabetes and wondered if there is a family link to the disease. Can anyone help me find out. I really would appreciated knowing.Cheers,Pamela
