Hate living in my own skin...Why be living, why live a empty life. Why be part of a society that you don't belong in. Why wake up every day just to feel the pain once again...ÊI hate my life, i hate having to pretend that i am alright just for others not to be concerned. I hate having to pretend that i am ok, when in fact, all i can think about is leaving this life and not having to deal with anything anymore.ÊI know there are people out there that has to deal with far worst things than what i have to deal with, but thats their life not mine. I have to face my own obstacles and clearly i am to weak and to pathetic to deal with it.ÊFor years now i have wanted to take my life. I never even tried as i can't even begin to think about what it would do to my family. There are only 3 reasons why i still walk the surface of the earth. 1 - my cat that i love dearly. 2 - my mother. 3 - my father.ÊWithout them in my life, i would not be here. If anything has to happen to them i will take my own life in a heartbeat. But until then, all i can hope for is that someone would do me the favor and kill me. Be it a car accident or someone that kills me. Even in my career as a firefighter.ÊAll i want is to be gone, to be pain free and not having to worry about anything ever again.
