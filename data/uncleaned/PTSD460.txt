ÊStarted my day with a meltdown....This morning as I was putting away laundry and folding blankets, I came across an old blanket that reeked of my ex's cologne. Suddenly, I was overcome with memories of the fights, the arguments, the namecalling, and the day that I discovered his double life. I found out about the women, the drained bank account, even the women that he had lined up on facebook. Then I was absolutely gut sick and wanted to puke. Immediately I threw the blanket into the washer, and melted into my couch, bawling. After all these months, I finally was able to cry. But I'm still having trouble shaking off these intrusive memories. I'm going from crying spells, to bouts of cold rage. Feel like I dont know whether to just throw up or explode. So far, today sucks.Ê.
