Stampede Trial Arm J Zytiga and Enzalutamide I was diagnosed in May 2014, with a PSA of124 , Gleason 4+5=9 Aggressive Prostate Cancer T3 N1 M1.Put on Zoladex ,and only just recently was fortunate enough to draw the Zytiga and Enzalutamide arm of the recently introduced Stampede clinical trial Arm J With no side effects so far .Lets hope that the trial is successful and these become first line  drugs for PCa  I would never have known I had PCa unless my brother had phoned me telling me he had jut been Dx and to get checked out as it can be hereditary. So whenever I see my friends and relations I mention that its important to ask for a PSA test. as like in my case there were no symptons of this horrible disease. My PSA has come down to 1.8 as of last week ,which I am pleased about.
