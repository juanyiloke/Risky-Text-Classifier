Driving testI'm hoping to do my driving test in the new year and was making small talk about it with a friend-of-a-friend at a party, he asked me if I was going to ask for a female instructor because I was a feminazi type and afraid of getting sexually assaulted I was completely taken aback. I suppose this is a two pronged question, would you ask for a specific tester, in any situation? And have you ever encountered someone with such insane beliefs about feminism?Personally, the only time I've ever asked for a female was at an american airport and that was because my experience with the male TSA had not been great up to that point and I found him quite creepy and leery. I have also encountered both men and women with these type of opinions but nobody has ever been that upfront so early into a conversation!
