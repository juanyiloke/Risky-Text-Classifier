Questions about by anorexia recoveryHi I'm in recovery and lately I've been eating a hell of a lot more since I starts my recovery. When I started I ate 2000 calories and now I'm eating 3000-4000, I'm not Hungary but my mind just tells me to eat till a point I'm nearly sick. Also, when I'm back to normal, how will I eat more healthily, is it easier or hard to cut back downWhilst in recovery I have gotten my old healthy looks back big I also need to add a few pounds, will it affect my looks and appearance eg bring my stomach out more and putting a bit more fat on my faceDuring recovery, to get my calories I have ate an awful amount of sweets because I have deprived myself of them for so long, is that good or badWhat is the ideal weight for someone who is 15 and 163cm tall
