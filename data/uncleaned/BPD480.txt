ÊJust done...I was doing okay today, until about ten minutes ago, when I popped on my online classroom. I have been harassed by this professor over the duration of this term which has caused my PTSD and BPD to flare up. This is the last week of classes, and I was the first person to post my homework assignments in the classroom (which is public for all the other students and professor to see). A few other students have posted since my post, and today I logged in, to find out that my professor took the time to respond nicely to each of the other students while completely ignoring my work. I went from feeling okay to feeling like crap. Feeling completely and totally worthless. On a scale from 0 (feeling nothing) to 10 (feeling like the end of the world), I went from 0 to 9 in the matter of seconds. I'm just done. I have one more assignment, my final paper, worth 10% of my grade and I don't even want to do it. I will do it because I would feel guilty if I didn't do it, but I'm just done. Wish I could disappear forever.
