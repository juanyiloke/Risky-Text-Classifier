vicious circlePosted over a year agoI was treated in my childhood for depression and anxiety. During the same period (my teens) i was being violently abused by my dad. This made my depression and anxiety worse i think and at the time i used to take a lot of recreational drugs and drink everyday to escape my life. This put me on a bad path and in my late teens ended up in me going young offenders institutions and later prison. I ended up in some fairly serious altercations in prison and was once trapped in a cell with 3 men who assaulted me quite severely. At the time i actually thought i was living my last moments. I got out not long after that assault and spent a few months outside and was suffering with very bad anxiety and nightmares of being trapped in that cell. I used to dream often that i was back inside only to wake and realise i was dreaming. After 5 months of being out i slipped up again and ended up back inside for the next couple of years. It was for me then, like living in a nightmare i couldn't awaken from. My anxiety was crippling me but because of the circumstance i had no choice but to put on a facade. I'm obviously out now and have been for about 4 and half years, but my anxiety can be terrible at times, my depression seems pretty severe and because i've lived a fairly strange life i feel very detatched from society and feel quite different to other people. I'm currently trying to get help with all this because i so much want to have a normal life. Last year was a bad time for me though and i started to have my dreams of prison again. It was almost a self fullfilling prophecy because i messed up and now i'm probably going back to prison next month. It's not gonna be as long as before, but it's not the time that bothers me but the heightened anxiety it gives me of going back to a place which holds such difficult memories for me. I don't really know what else to say, but just thought i needed to write this down.
