Anxiety or panic ? Ê13    just had a horrible time the last few hours can someone help please, started the day fine went to work for an hour, can't manage much more ( surgical menopause ) then had lovely afternoon with daughter and drove twenty five miles home, got through door and felt very strange, very nauseas, tingly, numb face with tingly lips, jelly like legs, pounding heart like nothing on earth, almost passed out and do t know how I stopped myself - dropped to floor and stayed there for around half an hour until I slowly felt a bit better, crawled onto sofa and tried to calm myself, it was horrible really horrible, I had something like this a year   when my father died but nothing as nasty since and I don't know what brought it on, I still feel weird and washed out and wobbly, can anyone advise as I don't know if was a panic attack or anxiety or are they the same, I'm scared now and worried that something really bads going to happen to me now, just awful , thanks for hearing me.
