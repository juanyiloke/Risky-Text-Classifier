Spoiling my life with worryHI I am 55 with a 16 year old son who is taking GCSE's this year. I am worried about everything from my health to him dying to me dying before I see him grow up. I am crying as I type this as I so scared. I have had health problems on and off and have now convinced myself I have oesophogeul cancer as I have chest pains and trouble swallowing some foods, GP said it was GERD then a chest infection, but after finishing antibiotics still feel no better. I do suffer from GERD and it could be, but I am so sure I am going to die soon as it cannot be cured. My husband and son are getting so sick or me googling everything, Son said at weekend I have not wasted 1 minute of my life worrying about dying you have wasted thousands. I know he is right, I know I have to stop googling but I am so scared of dying before he grows up properly that it is making life unbearable. I will be telling GP all this later, but am not depressed just anxious. I know I sound pathetic but I am so sad about all this.
