Vacation? I dont need that, Im American!2014-09-24, 09:00 PMRecently I've been thinking about all the hours I've been putting in towards work and that I kinda deserve a vacation. But for some reason, whenever I talk to other people like "Hey how was your summer", they always give boring responses like "nuttin". It turns out that 1)they are either working class without vacation giving employers or 2)dont earn enough to actually go anywhere, so they just spend their time off watching netflix or return it in for cash. It doesnt seem fair that tourists can afford to take time off, fly all the way the fuck over here from Japan, stay here for two weeks, visit all the theme parks, fly all the way back, and still have time left over, when us Muricans cant afford to take time off to visit our backyards...The United States is the only developed country that doesnt have minimum vacation requirements by law. Where European countries get 5 weeks off MINIMUM, we dont get shit! They get to do it and it doesnt effect their economy productivity, how come we dont! >Here is a nice PDF with all the health benefits of vacation: [url]http://www.timeday.org/right2vacation/Compared%20with%20other%20countries.pdf[/url]Here is a funny youtube comment I read from Evil Spock:
