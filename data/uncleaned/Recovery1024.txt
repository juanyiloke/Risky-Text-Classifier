Today!So I spent the day with family that I don't see often, and it turned out to be an amazing experience!! I've got 2 baby nephews that I'd never met before, and I got to meet them for the first time. I spent hours holding them and getting to know their personalities. The best feeling in the world was when I was able to make each one of them laugh. My whole family has tested me twice on being able to tell them apart, because without being able to see, I have to go by the sounds they make, their features, and how they act. So far, I haven't gotten them mixed up.
