recently diagnosed¥	Hi I have posted this elsewhere so decided to post on here too.  I have recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer (Triple Negative).  I have my lumpectomy booked for the 13th April as well as sentinel node removal.  I have been advised my treatment path will then be Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy.¥	I asked about the BCA 1 and BCA2 testing however was advised that I do not qualify as I am 40?  What are other peooples experiences of this, I thought I was relatively young to be honest.  My other issue is my mum had breast cancer and cervical cancer and my dad had prostate cancer.  I really dont understand why I would not qualify for the gene testing.¥	Has anyone got any advise about my treatment path, what to expect and other peoples experiences of  gene testing.  I have lots and lots of questions and am getting more and more anxious the closer it gets to my surgery.¥	I would greatly appreciate any advise¥	xx¥	Birty
