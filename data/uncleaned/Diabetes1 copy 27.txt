How long after eating do you test blood glucoseHello allI've been occupied with other health issues over the last year or so and have very badly ignored my Type II diabetes. Saw a nice but strict new diabetes nurse yesterday and my HBa1C was 111 up from 96 last time. Was 126 upon diagnosis. She wants me on 48 so I've a long way to go - first thing is getting back onto my meds (metformin and glicazide) which I'd stopped taking - I know very stupid of me  . I must get a handle on my blood glucose control or I'm going to suffer the consequences. Anyway, I'm now back on regular testing, my Contour XL is charging and would like to know how long after finishing or starting eating a meal should I test my blood glucose please? For anyone interested, it was 11.8 this morning, not fasting but before eating (woke up with migraine and didn't get up until 10:30).Thank you in advance for your input.
