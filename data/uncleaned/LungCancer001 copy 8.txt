could lung cancer be hereditary?here are some facts I know after many years of life- someone who never smoked was diagnosed of lung cancer- someone who smoked 1 to 2 packs daily lived to old ages and never got any cancerdoes it mean lung cancer could be hereditary?? When someone who does not smoke at all and gets lung cancer, does it mean it is possible lung cancer runs in his family and his family members would have higher risk of lung cancer?OK, let me put it simply, my mum was diagnosed of lung cancer at the age of 47 and died one year after. She was never a smoker and she had never worked in construction site, radiation environment or anywhere that could expose herself to radiation. She was a tailordressmaker before she married, after she married, she became a full-time housewife taking care of us.No other family members have cancer. But my grandma and grandpa (father's parents) died of accidents in their young age, so I have little information about the grand's levelDoes it mean I have higher chance of getting lung cancer or other types of cancer in the future?
