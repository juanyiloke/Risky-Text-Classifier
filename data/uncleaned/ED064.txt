Extremely sick mentally and physically. Don't know what to doAbout 6 months ago I started eating a little more than normal. It started gradually. after gaining weight, im bingeing and purging. I feel awful all the time and stopped getting my period. I don't know how to stop or what to do. I'm depressed because of the weight gain and having been tiny all my life, this is a nightmare. My job is stressful on top of it, and I cannot go 5 mins without thinking about food. Does medication help? It's like a horrible cycle, im depressed over the gain, binge, purge, hate myself, rinse repeat. I keep saying I won't do it anymore but I always do. I know it's a habit and if I could get through a week of not doing it, it would help immensely. Just can't seem to get past that one week. I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this, I guess just looking for any advice possible.
