Medication Question...Are there any medications that target the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia? The reason why I am asking this is because I would like to completely eradicate my negative symptoms, such as the lack of the ability to begin and sustain planned activities. Another group of symptoms that I would like to rid myself of are the cognitive symptoms, such as poor executive functioning - the ability to understand infomation and use it to make decisions - and poor working memory - the ability to use information immediately after learning it. Sometimes it seems that I am not even aware of these symptoms, which is probably part of the illness. However, my symptoms are not that severe right now, and I have come a long way since I was at my worst. I can now study every now and then, whereas when I was at my worst I could not study/learn/memorize anything at all.I used to experience hallucinating and 'hearing things', which, however, I now no longer experience.
