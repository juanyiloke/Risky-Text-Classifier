Grooming: Media influence or Innate disposition?We hear so much about how girls are influenced by the media and they are held up to certain standards etc but how much of that is the media stirring up what is already there?For example, back when I was hitting puberty (early 90's) there was no internet and I was still very much of the generation where you learned from the playground. The one thing I was always compelled to do was to keep my lady garden trimmed. I wasn't aware of porn at the time but for some reason, I just liked to keep down there trimmed. The whole make up thing passed me by. I wasn't bothered by it and to this day (and my mother's shame) I sport the natural luck.My friend has a granddaughter and she is five. From when she was old enough to walk, she was drawn to makeup. She loves lipstick and nail varnish and when I asked her the other day what she wants to be when she grows up she said a makeup artist. I can totally see this child being a very good make up artist. She loves everything about it but she isn't vain or conceited. I have never once heard her saying "am I pretty". She is too young to know that the words "celebrity" or "media" are and if you asked her about any of the current day pop stars, she wouldn't have a clue. She would probably think you were asking about a character in Doc McStuffins that she hadn't heard of.ÊI think it is just her personality and I don't see anything wrong with it. She is a well balanced child who accepts that there are certain times when she can't wear makeup but at other times, she loves playing around with it. A lot of people wouldn't agree with letting a child that young wear make up but I don't think it does any harm.ÊAnyways, I was just wondering about how others felt. I have been subjected to the media's influence my whole adult life and still don't feel the need to wear makeup. This child doesn't even know what the media is, yet for some reason she is drawn to makeup.
