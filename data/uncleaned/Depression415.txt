It Just Keeps Deteriorating SlowlyÊ  edmund_fitzgerald ,Ê05 May 2015PREAMBLE: what follows is going to be a lot of venting because I simply have nowhere else to vent and nobody to talk to.Ê I have no professional help, and family members are largely offhand/dismissive ("deal with it"/"grow up"/"it is what it is").ÊSome people, I am convinced, are simply not supposed to be happy.Ê If they are, that constitutes an upset that has to be restored.Ê Those people are the ones who are always worried / feel guilty and feel like they need to apologize--if not for something they did, for what they didn't do / might do / might not do--in short, for having the temerity to be alive.ÊÊAs you may suspect, I consider myself to be one of those people.Ê I feel like an underachiever, like I'm always a day late and a dollar short no matter what, and that the bar is constantly getting raised so I'm always deficient.Ê Thus, life has had no joy for...well, years.Ê I have no idea how long.ÊÊI hate my life and nearly everything about it.Ê The lone sources of any joy are my grandchildren; any other family members...meh.Ê To be truthful, I've been married for nearly 41 years and for some time it's been largely a shell.Ê Some couples grow together over time; we've diverged to the point where we have nearly nothing in common apart from the grandchildren.Ê I don't talk about my work because it would be breathtakingly boring and incomprehensible to anyone not in the same field of engineering--and frankly, I wish my wife would accord me the same courtesy when talking about her endeavors: I know nothing of what or whom she speaks of and therefore have no appreciation/can't comment intelligently; it becomes so much chatter.Ê It's getting to the point where she's considering changing churches on doctrinal grounds; I'm left with several choices if that happens, all of them unpalatable to one degree or another.ÊMedication is no better than a rearguard action: I'm in a slow retreat and don't expect it to get better.Ê I've tried therapy and found it useless.Ê I see no point in shelling out money to have someone sit there and say "I see...what do you think you should do?" or something similar.Ê I could get that by standing in front of a mirror.Ê (If someone has a suggestion about therapy that may be more concretely helpful, fine.)Ê There are two considerations that prevent something...major, let's say from happening: 1) I'm the meal ticket for my wife (it's doubtful that insurance policies would pay off if the event weren't accidental), and 2) infinitely more importantly, I won't do anything to cause any psychologic harm, no matter how small, to my three (soon to be four) grandchildren.Ê I simply won't chance that.Ê Anyone else...they'd adjust in time.ÊI suppose I have to get enured to a life of constant psychological / spiritual pain to one degree or another--and get enured to the concept that it will only get worse over time.
