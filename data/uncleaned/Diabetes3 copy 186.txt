Work and diabetesHi im a new member and would like your advice. Im a type 2 diabetic and recently my sugars have more than doubled from around 7.2 to over 20 at times. During this time ive had one cold after another and have been feeling fairly rotten. Ive had time off work because of this and partly because i work in health care and dont want to pass my germs on. My employer has informed that i have been summoned to a meeting to discuss my sickness record and this could possibly involve a formal warning. Does anybody know were i stand with this? Can they give me a warning for something that i currently have no control of. Thanks in advance
