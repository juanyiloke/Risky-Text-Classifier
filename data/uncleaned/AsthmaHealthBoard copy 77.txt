Keeping Asthma under control________________________________________I was born with Asthma so I have been used to it's hindrances for some time. I had my Asthma under control with the use of Advair for a long time. My asthma was usually affected by my allergies and would be worse around September of every year. I would usually be admitted to a hospital every year for 1-3 months because of it. When I was 15 I started receiving Xolair, an immune boosting drug and while on it, I never once got sick from my allergies or Asthma. At this time I also was given allergy shots and after four years I was taken off of Xolair after completing my allergy shots. After a while, I also stopped taking Advair. Since then I have had my Asthma in check with breathing exercises and a healthy diet along with regular physical exercise.I think about how I used to be on so many drugs just to keep my asthma under control. I was on Advair since I was about 7. I had to have the 500/50 dose. I also had to have an albuterol inhaler that I had to take before and after any physical activity and when my allergies were too bad. I was on so many different allergy medications as well.I am wondering how others do in keeping their Asthma in check and what they have done or tried.
