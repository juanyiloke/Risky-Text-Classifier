Off Topic Random Question2014-01-06, 04:38 AMI have a stupid random question, it's the middle of the night and I can't text anybody because I'll wake them up. It's -18 degrees outside right now with a high of -12 tomorrow. All state schools are closed, I went snowboarding Fri/Sat/Sun and they are closed. My buddy works outside and they aren't working. But. I work in an office, I haven't heard of it being closed but is it stupid to call in in the morning and be like "hey boss my truck wont start." I'm pretty sure it would start but I also don't really want to park it outside all day when it's that cold just because I can get to work doesn't mean I can get home. Mostly, I seriously just partied way too much this weekend pretty consistently too. I think I drank probably like 14 beers and maybe 12 shots total. It was a party Fri/Sat/Sun but I guess I've done worse. Maybe 6 drinks a day spread out with napping. So I am being a bad employee and my Sunday Funday turned into a Monday noneday and I want to stay warm, eat, sleep, sober up, and go to work like a million bucks on Tuesday when it's warmer out. Is that unreasonable? I mean it's -18 out, he can't be too pissed if I call in and say I can't get to work.
