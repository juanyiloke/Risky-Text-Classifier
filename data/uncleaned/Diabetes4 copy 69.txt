New ResultsGot some new results today, as i have my first "Annual diabetes review" with a nurse at the drs next week. It's not been 3 months since my last test results, and its only been 1 month since i got the libre, and about 5-6 weeks since i last saw the GP about my cholesterol and was reccomended by both hospital dr and GP to take statins.With the threat of statins if i don't get my cholesterol under 4 in the 2 month diet trial period i was given, i've been following the diet sheet i was given by the GP and avoiding saturated fats for a month or so, until today. I've had one day off each weekend but otherwise i've swapped meat for quorn, swapped milk for soya milk, almond butter on sandwiches not a ham sandwich, no butter/margarine/oil/eggs/cheese/beef/pork/fish/meat/etc, soya yoghurt instead of normal yoghurt, drinking the little cholesterol drinks, taking a multivitamin pill and an omega 3 pill, cut out cashew nuts and crisps. Actually it all seems in vain. I've been considering trying a lower carb diet than usual, usually i eat a moderate carb diet untill i've been on the diet sheet the dr gave me.  However i dont think i can risk my cholesterol getting any higher, so my gut instinct is that i should carry on with the diet my GP gave me but stick to it exactly - no meal off at the weekend any more. I've read that the opposite diet can reduce cholesterol, but its exactly against what i've been told to do and i can't let my cholesterol get any higher than it already is. Help?I'm pleased with my a1c and fbg results though, and confident that i can get it into a good place in a few months time.
