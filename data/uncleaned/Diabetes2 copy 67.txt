insulin pump   Hello  I have been diagnosed type one diabetic for three and a half years, since being on insulin my hab1c has always been in range and my consultant would really like me to be on an insulin pump. I am coming round to the idea as my injection sites are sore, I am put off by the visibility aspect, I know it may seem vein but I like the idea that by looking at me you wouldn't be able to tell but in a dress with a pump you would.I would reallyyyyyy appreciate any advice anybody has about insulin pumps.Thank you very much in advance!!
