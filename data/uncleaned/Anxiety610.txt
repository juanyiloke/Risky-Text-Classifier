Hyper awareness of existence and realityI have extreme pure O OCD. 3 months ago I was diagnosed with depersonalization. Two weeks ago I had a sudden realization in the shower which resulted in a panic attack and has steadily gotten worse since. I seem to have become completely aware of my own existence and reality if that makes any sense. It's like I all of a sudden realize I'm a human being in a body with thoughts and apart of this world. I'm obsessing over existential things like how we got here and how we came from nothing. And it just allOf a sudden feels so strange. Reality itself just seems so surreal and strange. It's getting to the point where reality itself is causing panic attacks and depression. I feel so uncomfortable looking around the room and realizing how complex reality is. Has anybody ever had this and recovered? Thank you.
