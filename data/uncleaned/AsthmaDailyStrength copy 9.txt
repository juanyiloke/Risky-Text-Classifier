My asthma was under control for years, (I am 20) I had to take sulbutamol twice a day however never needed my reliever. I unfortunately went on holiday and smoked for roughly 4 days,,,However since then I now have a constant wheeze which my inhalers will not get rid of. I have been to the GP throughout November and December however nothing has helped, been on 2 courses of steroids with little improvement. Am now on 250 seratide and there is some mild improvement however it is not relived breathing as I once had before. Anyone have anything similar after stopping or starting to smoke? I have not smoked anything since. Anyone had improvements. Not sure how to proceed now with getting my breathing back to normal, feeling it will never return to normal again....
