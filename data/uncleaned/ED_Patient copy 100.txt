Ive had Bulimia for 30 yearsI have been bulimic on and off over the last 30 years...started when I was 20 and am 51 now. I know its me mainly trying to control my weight gain.... but whenever I have emotional stresses and things not going as planned.... I just lose it... I have a spell of just bingeing and throwing up and laxatives for a few weeks and things calm down and I feel ok and happy... I have had long spells of psychotherapy...was effective in the sense that I thought I was cured for nearly 3 years and it started again as the scales tipped more and more... Like everyone else on here... I do realise its so damaging for my health.... (last 11 years have lived on my own.)..so bingeing and purgeing hasnt been a problem...no one knows.... now I am in a relationship and it may not be that easy throwing up and getting away with it .. and I feel a little better for it ..thinking I might stop because there is someone else around who I care for... and dont want to worry and cause him concern.... I feel positive at the moment... AND I wish it really STOPS!
