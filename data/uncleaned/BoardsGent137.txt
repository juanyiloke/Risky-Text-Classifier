What's the difference between a wash and cut and a dry cut?I've decided that today, I'm going to finally go to a good hair dresser I've been impressed by, in my case, Bedford Stuy in Temple Bar. Now, this is my first time actually making an informed decision getting a haircut. I've heard a wet cut is better and tends to be more accurate, how true is this? Generally, I'm the type of person to wash my hair right before going to the barbers, as I don't like presenting greasy hair to a barber. So does a wet cut make much of a difference?
