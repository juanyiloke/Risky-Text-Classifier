A different person.Today I had an appoiontment (Child in Need - for my daughter) with Social worker, nursery manager and my mental health nurse. And during the meeting a lot of things were brought up, But one noticeable comment was made. The social worker took a great notice and made referrence to how much more relaxed and brighter looking than I had on previous meetings with him. (He has been involved now for 3 months roughly and the last time I had a meeting with him was a month ago now) They are continue to be involved with some more direct support now they understand what kind of problems are being faced. And I do feel it I do notice the difference in myself, I have more confidence over this job interview tomorrow, I have more esteem in general about myself, and all it took to get me there was the right kind of (uninterrupted) support. Ok it also took me refusing access to Health worker, urgent care... and police (eventually caved and let them in) to get anywhere, but if I hadnt woul I really be in the position I am in today, meds that appear to be working with no side effects, a better feeling, and I am getting more sleep, its just win win for me at the moment.It takes time it takes effort, but it can be achieved. I didnt think it possible, but I think I can say that I am overall feeling the most positive I have ever done in a very very long time.Those who say that it Can't be done, look at what you are doing to benefit yourself, and if you arent doing anything to benefit yourself, look at what you have to change so that you are.Life won't always give you what you want, but it will give you what you need.
