Hair loss decided by mother or fathers side?Hey guys, I have a bit of a receding hair line, it looks ok but defo isnt as strong as it used to be. Would like to stop this if possible. Im 28. My father has lost almost all his hair at this stage. Am I screwed? My mothers side of the family has no history of hair loss, My granddad has a full head of hair at 89. Is it known to come from mother or fathers side or is it a toss of the coin?If its possible to stop this what products are best? Thanks for any info.
