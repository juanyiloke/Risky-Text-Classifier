My mother had schizophrenia, she also had psychic ability. For example she came home and said she saw my sisters baby's face in the concrete then she said the babies dead. 2 minutes later we got a call and that was exactly the case. My sisters and I all have psychic ability to a degree. I immediately know if something is wrong with them and vice versa. I dream if someone is going to die and it's not symbolic I am just told and they do.For example, before my mums death (cancer quite some years ago) I was at home got up and announced at breakfast to my partner that I dreamt dad just knocked on the door and said mum was dying.Then a few minutes later he did. Maybe my sisters and I have a mild form of what she had.Anyway could name a lot of experiences here. Point is I really believe there is a link. I am a very logical person but I cant pretend these things didnt happen. I am not plagued by it...but maybe mum was.If it happened all the time it could send you crazy. My gut tells me there is definatly a connection. Something is being missed with this illness. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? It's the saddest illness any insight would be appreciated.
