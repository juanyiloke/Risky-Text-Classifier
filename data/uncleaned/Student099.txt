Which uni to go to (hard to decide anyway but boyfriend at one of them)by EmsssHi guys so basically I'm deciding between cardiff and sheffield uni to go to in September, the courses I like just as much, but I prefer the cardiff city centre, but prefer the accommodation in sheffield and think it's more sociable.Also to throw another thing into the mix my boyfriend goes to cardiff and will be in 2nd year. Now part of me wants to go cos he's there, but a part of me doesn't cos we're good at long distance and I don't want it to stop me having a fresh new start with new friends.I don't wanna be on a night out and bump into him cos then id not wanna ignore him but id wanna stay with my uni friends too.I also wouldn't like to see him talking to random girls in a club or see him with girls if we break up, so atleast with sheffield I wouldn't have that.We are really happy together and not too clingy but I just don't know how it will be until I get there.What do you guys think? Is it bad to go to the same uni as him? (Ps. I'm not going cos he's there, it's more of a bonus) or should I not considering there's another uni I could go to?Thanks for any help, much appreciated  x
