about meOn Dec 30th I went in for my regular diabetic check up. Got a clean bill of health. Mentioned to the doctor that I have been having shortness of breath since October and it seems to be getting worse. Took an x-ray and said I had fluid on my right lung. On the 31st I went to the hospital and had 1600ml of fluid drained out. Ya that's a lot. Today Jan 3 I got a call from my doctor that he would like to talk to me in his office this morning. The results for the lab test on the fluid drained from me show cancer cells. Monday I go in for a CT scan. As of now I don't know what, how much or location of the cancer. Know very little about the whole cancer issue. Just sitting here very frightened. It took a while to hit home but when it did I just sat on my bed and hugged my dog and cried. choking up a little as I type this. I am married and have adult children and 6 grand kids but feel completely alone accept for my dog. I think I'm going to be hugging her a lot in the next few days. I feel I need a place to vent and this looks like a good place to start. A few people I know have had cancer and survived more have not. All that said I thank you for your time to let me get some of this off my chest(bad choice of words) I understand that my journey is just beginning I just wish I knew where it was going. I am 66 years old, my father just passed away at 92 on December 5th. He would have been 93 in February. Trying hard not to feel sorry for myself but it is hard not to. I will update Monday after the CT scan. Thank you again for letting me air some of this out. I think it is helping. Time to go get another face full of dog slobber Ted
