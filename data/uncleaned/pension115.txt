Care Home FeesI have a relative that has been in a care home close to 3 years with vascular dementia. The fees that we pay to keep her in the home have taken away her life savings and it almost certain we will have to sell her home to enable her to continue receiving care. Although I couldn't ask for anything more of the care home, it have recently been made aware that it should be the NHS funding the care and I can claim back anything we have already paid.ÊDoes anybody know if this is true? If so, how do I go about claiming back the fees and will it have any affect on the care home? Thanks.
