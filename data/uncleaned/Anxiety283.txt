Moving with anxiety...I've found out that I have anxiety this past year and it's made everything very difficult. It has been manageable since I started lexapro to try an keep it at a base level until I can understand my triggers and how to keep it under control. Now I'm moving in a few days and its rearing its ugly head again. I get anxious often but it goes away shortly after, now i have chest tightness and feel awful the way I did when this all started. I know that moving is very stressful and this is my first time doing it. I'm mostly just worried that I'll panic while I'm moving and I won't have my safe place to go relax.. when I get super anxious I always go to our bed room and lie down and distract myself with my laptop...Soon I won't have the option to do that and its scary. I told my boyfriend about this and he just tells me to stop and that Ill be fine, but we all know that doesn't work.Any tips on how to deal?
