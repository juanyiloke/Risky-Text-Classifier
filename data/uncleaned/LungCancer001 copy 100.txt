3mm Lung NoduleHello,I normally have posted a few times to the colon cancer forum since I was dx back in May with a HGD polyp that was not yet cancerous but pre-cancerous. I had a complete removal of my right ascending colon along with 27 lymph nodes that were all non-malignant. Before this dx I was suffering from severe abdominal pain and bloating which led me to the ER and hence a CT scan of my abdominal area. The CT scan discovered a 3 mm nodule that was located either on my lower right or left lobe. The ER doc said to follow up with my Primary Care Physician which I did. She looked at the report and dismissed it as a granuloma or ever perhaps scar tissue from a previous infection or pneumonia which I have had a couple of times during my life. Should I be more diligent about following up on this. This was the only nodule the CT scan dectected but because of my recent dx with the colon, even though it was benign did not know if the two were interrelated. I am not a smoker per say and have not smoked regularly for a very long time now. Should I follow up within a year to see if the nodule has changed in size, etc?Thanks for any inputLaurie
