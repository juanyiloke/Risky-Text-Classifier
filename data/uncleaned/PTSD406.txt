ÊPTSD outta control..So.. I have severe PTSD and its what has ended me up in Psyciatric institutions over 12 times the past 5 years. My symptoms have calmed down a lot until today and right now I am really struggling. My PTSD stems from sexual abuse from my step father and since the last time that happened 5 years ago I have never even been able to get intimate with anyone. Well, I thought I might as well try dating again, right? So I made a POF app and met a guy. I was dumb enough to let him come over to my house and he wanted to watch a movie in my room alone. " just a movie". He wouldnt stop trying to touch me everywhere and kiss me and I had to keep pushing him off and I eventually had to make him leave. I am so upset and crying.. He could have raped me and it all of this was my fault tonight. My paranoia is going on that he will try to come back to my place and I am having major flashbacks and everything right now.. Im scared to go to sleep because I dont want any nightmares.. I dont know how I can ever live a normal life if I cant even get intimate with a guy.. just so upset right now.. any ideas on what I can to do cope or words of encouragement would much be appreciated..
