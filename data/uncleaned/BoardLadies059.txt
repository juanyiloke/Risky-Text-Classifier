Your place or mine?!

This thread could be aimed at anyone not living with their partner, or those who are free and single!

Recently dating a new guy, whether we go to his or mine is usually based on which is handiest, for the night, and for the morning. Tomorrow night we could do either - so I've been considering this!

I'm a very messy person. Sometimes I prefer to go to a guy's place, plainly because I can't be certain what state my place is in. I also like my own habits and comforts, liking to be in my own room than someone else's. Then there's the house sharing versus living alone thing too. I've never lived alone, but have dated guys who did, it was always his place.

I guess for me the deciding factors would be handiness, comfort, privacy.
