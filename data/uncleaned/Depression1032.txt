Motivation is hard to come byHi,ÊI have been dealing with depression for 10 years off and on but in the last year or so it has gotten worse. I feel tired a lot of the time and don't have much motivation to do anything. I am studying at university and I often find it hard to even get to class. I am on anti depressants and have seen a few psychologists about my problems but it only seems to help for a week or so before returning to how it was before. I have tried CBT and ACT and they do help but I feel like I need something else to help me get up and start living my life again. I was wondering if anyone can tell me what I should expect from my anti depressants, when it might be time to try a new one and any other tips I can try?
