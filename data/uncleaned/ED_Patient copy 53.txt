I've recently admitted to binge eating; looking for strategies to help stop. Can anyone help?I'm 22 and have always been someone who over eats. I have noticed I binge when I am going through difficult times. This year, I have been through quite a lot and feel very stressed. Previously to this year I lost a good amount of weight and started feeling happy about myself. Since I have been feeling down about certain things that have happened this year, I have noticed that I have been eating more again. I would like to find some strategies to help me cope when I feel the need to binge. I don't want to put weight on. I am someone who really enjoys healthy eating, and I know exactly what I should be eating, but I have the urge to eat unhealthy, sweet food when I am feeling down. I recently went to the doctors about my eating habbits and they put me on anti depressants to help boost my mood, and therefore take away the urge to binge however, I have always been someone that doesn't agree with taking tablets and I don't like the idea of having to rely on a tablet to make me feel happy.(I don't judge anyone who does take them, it is just a personal preference). I have thought about how I feel before, during and after binge eating, and I have realised that I don't feel happy or satisfied during any point while I am eating, so don't understand why I do it, as it makes me feel so disgusting.If anyone can give me any advice, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance, Lizzy
