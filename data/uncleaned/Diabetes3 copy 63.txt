More bad news :(Thought things could not get worse, but they have  As part of trying to get my blood pressure down from the odd peak of 193 / 167 blood pressure meds were changed for a second time in as many weeks.They were happy with the last weeks blood pressure readings. More blood tests were taken on Thurs to see whats going on and a get a new bass line. Had a phone call today, saying that my kidney function has deteriated and they need to change my meds yet again asap  . New prescriptions done and collected and start the change in meds. Now have to have more blood tests done again at the end of next week. If they show no sign of improvement another change of meds will be required only this time the new meds will effect the glucose levels in some way.As a result of this they aren't going to put me on insulin as they say they need to establish whats going on with my kidneys.It would be nice for once to have some good news.
