Lovely to drop in and meet old friends!I can't believe how long it's been since I was last here as it's been a very eventful year!  I'm very happily settled in my new job but am still having a real struggle to keep on track with the big D.  I eat way too many carbs despite one of my blunt medical team telling me I wasn't going to live to my 80's but could make my 70's with some fundamental changes! I'm hoping you haven't forgotten me and I can still pick your brains for advice.I am only working a six hour day now but the consequence of which is that I'm not entitled to an official break - harsh.  I have no problem testing regularly and can grab a snack when and if I need one but I'm finding it really hard to establish a stable routine. BTW - lovely to be back.
