  So Proud TodaySo today, my 19 month old daughter has her first ever day at nursery. she had no induction and was there for 2 hours and did not cry once. she was fine all day and loved it so much she cried because she had to leave. and then i managed to get her into her own bed tonight and it took me less then an hour. i am so happy about this as up until last night she was still in bed wit me like she has been since birth and she was still breaft fed. fingers crossed tonight goes ok !!!! so so proud right now
