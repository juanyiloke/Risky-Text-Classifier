ÊGetting over the mountain of healingI still have much work to do, but do feel a lot has been processed. My childhood was like the book a Child Called IT in many ways, so there is a lot to work on. I've had unethical T's, who caused more damage than any good. Finally I found a wonderful T 7 years ago who I made a lot of progress with using EMDR and her vast knowledge and experience with treating trauma. She has now become on of the top experts in her field. Having to leave her due to moving, has been so hard on me. It is hard to say good bye but just as hard trying to find someone even half as experienced as she in my new city. She is at least helping me with the transition.ÊI want so hard to tell everyone on how much EMDR has changed my life. Someday I am probably going to write a book about it. While EMDR isn't for everyone, if you are struggling, as I read here so many people in so much pain, it is worth a shot .Find somebody who regularly uses it in their practice, not just somebody who had the training. See a trauma specialist who has advance training in EMDR.ÊThere is so much I want to say, but I am trying to keep myself as anonymous as possible. Being online isn't the safest thing to be doing, with something so personal. I fear for my safety and my kids and husband's safety every day as there is someone who would rather see me dead than to tell my childhood story. But now I have the mental health strength to fight back. It has been really hard to process all my childhood trauma while still dealing with the current threat of my abuser who wants me dead still. My PTSD is complicated but EMDR has helped so much. I was in the same space as many of you many years ago before I found a good therapist to help me.ÊI'm not looking for any pity, but I am hoping to bring some sort of hope to some of you that you can heal. I have more healing to do, some days are really hard, but I have done so much already. Love you guys!Ê
