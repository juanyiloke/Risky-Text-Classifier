Brachytherapy continued By the time John had his implants on 3rd June 2014 his PSA was 6.3.He had PSA results yesterday which showed it is down to 1.8. Seeds are weaker by now but hopefully still doing their jobWe had to go to The Royal London today for John to have  a flexible Cystoscopy as his flow at the last appointment in September was deemed to be slow by his consultant.However, all appears to be well. So we breathe a sigh of relief for now. Onwards and upwards to a follow up in February.
