Do people say things about you being too thin that hurt? TWTalking to a friend of mine who is overweight and has been on a quest to lose weight (and has lost quite a bit) she always says that people don't talk about people who are thin or too thin in the same way as they talk about people who are overweight. I've been trying to explain to her that they do- and what's worse they do it in front of you, often in a really scathing voice. I find any comments about my weight, size or what I'm eating hard, especially seeing as I don't see myself as small at all. Can anyone else relate to this?I'm not saying people don't say nasty or hurtful things about people who are overweight- or short, tall, or any number of other things. Just that being thin is often seen as a desirable but people are also not always pleasant about it either. Personally people need to think what they say full stopI'm sorry if this is triggering or offends anyone. Please delete if it's not allowed
