 What's right with us all - sharing our greatest stengths and what is valuable about each of usHi everyone,It's clear from this forum that we are all struggling with our own battle against mental illness and life in general. I find it difficult to read some of the messages on here at times and would love to share what is going right in our lives despite all the pain we are in. I hope that this would also help us all to remember that life is ever changing and what feels unbearable at one time will not last forever. Please join me in sharing what you really like and love about yourself and the wins you are having in your life. Even if you don't want to share, you might read this and have a very small mental shift away from the dark thoughts and feelings you have.What's right in my life? I have two amazing children who are incredibly bright and emotionally resilient beyond their years, thanks a lot to sharing my experiences with them and them seeing you can live well despite feeling terrible at times. My friends and family take strength from seeing me get through the difficult periods of battling my depression and anxiety. Somehow I can always maintain a sense of humour through anything, including laughing at myself when I'm really unwell. Sometimes I have to give in to the way I feel, but I never give up and that is a huge achievement. Today I cleaned my house and got my children to school on time and I ate breakfast and lunch. So today was a big win for me. Every day I manage to continue breathing is a win for me. I look forward to hearing what is wonderful about each of you and what happened in your day that felt right. Even if it is something as small as you felt a beautiful breeze or a ray of sunshine or you decided to live another day. Wishing you all loving kindness.
