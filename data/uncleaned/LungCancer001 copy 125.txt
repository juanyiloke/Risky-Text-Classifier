  I'm so afraid, please help meHello everyone, my name's Julia I'm from Norway and new on this forum. I just wan't to start off with to tell you that I suffer from Health anxietyhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hypocho...roduction.aspx and have done so ever since my beloved grandmother passed away for some years ago. So why am I here on this forum? I'll tell you. For some days ago we had graduation at our school and after that we had a party in my friends garden. Almost all the boys at the party had decided to smoke cigars. I was at the party for like one and a half hour then I couldn't stand the smell of the smoke any longer and leaved. It wasn't that when I breathed out I could see the smoke but I could clearly smell it. Worth to mention is that I've been exposed to second hand smoke before once and that was in a car, the driver was smoking but all the windows of the car was open and once again I could only smell the smoke.All the propaganda about that smoking kills here in Norway makes me really sad (not because I like smoking, just because I've been exposed to second hand smoke). I feel so dirty and it feels like I'm already doomed, I will die in lung cancer when I'm about 50   I don't know if it's worth to mention but I'm a 17 year old girl, not overweight, have really good condition and I run long distance multiple times a week. I eat healty.
