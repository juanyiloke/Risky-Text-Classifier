Stage after chemo?¥	Me and my mum got told that we won't know what stage the Cancer is at until the operation.¥	However my mum is having chemo first then surgery, so if the chemo shrinks the tumor (which I hope it will) will we know still what stage the cancer was at? All we know so far is that there's a 2.4cm lymp in the Breast and 2 small cancerous lumps in the lymph nodes. She's got triple negative breast cancer.¥	Sorry this might sound dumb, but for weeks I wondered.¥	Also can we know what grade the cancers at? Or is that through surgery as well? The doctors haven't really told us much about the cancer itself other than TNBC.¥	Hope your all feeling fab!
