Want another baby eventually but too scaredI'm a single mother to a 6 year old. My pregnancy was difficult with her but in the end it was all good. I've been dating someone and am at the point where I am thinking about our future. I'm afraid to have another baby because I've been having headaches for about 2 years now which CT scans without contrast have shown that all is normal. I keep reading stories (I try to avoid them but they show up on my newsfeed) of women who had aneurisms while pregnant. Someone please ease my worries  I have constant health anxiety every day. If it isn't about my headaches I'm worried about cancer.
