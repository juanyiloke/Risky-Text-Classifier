I've been on this site almost a month now, most on the hypyothyroidism support group. (I just noticed recently there were more types of groups on here) So anyway... I was diagnosed with bronchial asthma when I was 3 yrs old. It was very severe throughout my childhood. I spent a good 75% or more of it in the hospital due to it. It sucked, I missed out on a lot. Couldn't join soccer (at that time my favorite sport) because of the stress running put on my lungs. Although I did love to run. Couldn't do a lot of normal things kids did because it, so I missed out on a lot. Weather wasn't to much of an issue, I lived mostly in Arizona, the heat was fine on me. At that time, my main triggers were dust, cold weather, running, and anything else that might've made it flare up. (those were just the ones I could remember. When I was about 15-16 we thought it was gone ( i had a aunt who had asthma, and hers went away after many years) Didn't have to use a inhaler for over 6 months no matter what I did. And now, I live with it. I've learned to cope, figuring my limits and strong points. Now my main trigger is cold weather, and overworking myself. I;ve strengthened my lungs through holding my breath under water longer and longer each time (has helped A LOT), Singing (I love to sing) sometimes will get out of breath, but I will start the song over and try again till I get it without issues. Anyway, sorry for the long intro lol, Hope all is doing well :)
