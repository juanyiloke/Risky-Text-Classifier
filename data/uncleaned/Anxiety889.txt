What medications are you on?I've officially been diagnosed with G.A.D. which wasn't surprising in the slightest, I'm more surprised that it had taken so long for me to get the diagnoses. What medications are you taking on for it?ÊI've been on SSRI's for years (Citalopram, Sertraline and Prozac) which seem to do little for my anxiety but help my depression. I'm currently taking 200mg of Sertraline and 15mg of Mirtazapine (which is a NaSSA) at night to help my insomnia.ÊSince I've been taking the Mirtazapine my anxiety has improved. Should I be taking NaSSA's instead? I feel like I should be on a lower dosage of Sertraline and a higher dosage of Mirtazapine or be taken off Sertraline all together.ÊI'm just sick of changing medications -_____-
