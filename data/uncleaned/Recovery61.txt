Personal SpaceThanks to some crazy hyperness from adderall I have started a long overdue cleaning spree. I have a long way to go still because I started rearranging furniture. It really feels different as things move. When I initially moved in where I was, someone else arranged the furniture to help me. Now that I am moving stuff around it is changing how I feel. I have not felt that I have had a home in a very long time. Today, it is slowly starting to feel like one. It is becoming more personal and a little more comforting.
