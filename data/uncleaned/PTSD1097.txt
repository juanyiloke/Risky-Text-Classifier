Growing up I did see a doctor which turned into a psychiatrist. I was always forced to go and medicated against my will. Tomorrow I see a psychologist who manages the medication I need to come off of and I really hate doing it. I've never had a situation where I wasn't screamed at, or bullied and pressured into going by my parents. They would do it until I was too exhausted to keep going. It's become almost a phobia. I'm terrified this will happen again tomorrow. I can't forget the past. I only go for medication management and I have brain fog still so I know that going is a good idea but I'm more than afraid. He's aware of this and tries to give me control but I have to keep going because my meds make me sick. My main problem now is pressure and fear. Mainly pressure and loss of control. I feel stuck
