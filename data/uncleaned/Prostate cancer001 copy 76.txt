prostatitis symptons Hi all.At 54 I was diagnosed with low grade PC ( 3+3 Gleason PSA average 3.2 ) in 2010 and I am on AS.When I had the saturation biopsy in 2010 I unfortunately ended up with an infection in the prostate for which I was on Cipro and other antibiotics for nearly 12 months but without success. I can live with the PC on AS with 6 monthly PSA checks but the Prostatitis is a different story, I have a lot of pain/discomfort, urinary issues, and extremely painful ejaculation which can feel ill for hours after. My urologist has tried different things but has basically said there is nothing more he can offer other than to try and keep the prostate "healthy" with regular ejaculation as this squeezes the prostate and promotes fresh new blood into the prostate, when I said "how often" his answer was " as often as you can ". Has anyone else been given this sort of advice and if so I would really like to understand how many times a week one should try to ejaculate.Thanks.
