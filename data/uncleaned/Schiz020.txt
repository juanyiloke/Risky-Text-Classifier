Can puberty cause any mental illness?by Alexmicheal49 » Mon May 04, 2015 6:10 pmHi, so I was diagnosed with psychosis around 7 months ago and I realized that all of the symptoms started around the age of 12 and I'm 13 at this very moment. I was curious because as I stated the symptoms started to appear when I hit puberty and when I turned 13 the hallucinations got a lot worse and I was thinking if it could have something to do with like the hormones since everything is changing up and things can go out of whack. I saw a Psychiatrist about it around 7 months ago and that's when I was diagnosed with psychosis and I see them once every month and she is convinced That it's Early onset Schizophrenia even though there is no family history of any mental illness except Anxiety. I also goto therapy and the therapist said I pretty much have all the symptoms of schizophrenia which really concerned me. Pretty much the main symptoms I have are both hearing voices and seeing things that aren't there including animals or figures that just stand there along with my surroundings being distorted and moving around as if the walls and floor turned into water. I have also had quite extremely bizarre and really creepy delusions which I think are extremely stupid thoughts now when I look back on them. Also around the time the symptoms started appearing my parents said I've started having extremely bad behavior problems but to me I just don't see it it's how I think I normally act. Anyways is there a possibility that puberty could have sparked all of this up or something around that area?
