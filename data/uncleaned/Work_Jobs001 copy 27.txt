Made redundant from a role that is now advertised________________________________________Hi ,I have a query about redundancy. The background- I was made redundant last year. I took redundancy because I was told my role was gone as part of a restructuring. If I stayed I would have to do a different role with some of my old job activities. As the new role was a more junior role I would no longer report into a senior manager and my title would change. I decided to take redundancy as I felt that taking a more junior role ,career wise was not a good move.My old job is now advertised with exactly the same title,responsibilities and skill requirements.My question is is it legal to make a role redundant and a few months later reinstate it?I would appreciate some advice
