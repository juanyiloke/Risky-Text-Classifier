Has the bottom just fallen out of my world   I have just been told by my GP that I may have T2 Diabetes. I am having a second blood test next week to confirm. Along with all my other medical problems, I did not expect to be told this. My eye sight is fine, although I do wear glasses they are only needed for reading and computer work. I have days where I feel tired but as I have an under active thyroide, I have always put it down to that. From what I have just read, it seems it could be the diabetes that is making me tired. I do have a major problem with my weight, again not helped by my thyroide problems. What can I do. I feel so alone. I haven't even told my family yet but I know they will be devastated.
