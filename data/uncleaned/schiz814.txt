After my recent trip to my doctor, she told me I could have schizophrenia. Seriously? I don't think so. Help me out here. I am doubting my doctor with her methods in making these statements. Here's what happened. I've always had thought insertions, which I wasn't aware of until my doc made me realize that the thoughts that I've been receiving from other people and my thoughts that are being broadcast were not conclusions from my simple logical deduction of events. Sure, I accept that. I do realize that it could not be possible, but when I'm so stressed out whatever I have come to realize as imaginary becomes real and true. So definitely, I can trust my doc when she says I have thought insertions. In terms of idea of reference, however, I guess I wasn't feeling well that time and told my doc that the people in my office are talking about me. I can hear their whispers and I know it's about me. Although I can't hear exactly what they're saying, I can "logically deduce" somehow that it is about me and it's something bad. I may have cried like there's no hope. But now that I am thinking about it, it's stupid. Then after telling me I have ideas of reference, my doc said that I may have schizophrenia. Is she allowed to just say it like that? What about other symptoms? As long as she doesn't prescribe me with anything more powerful than my meds now, it's fine. But I want to be sure that I can trust my doc. Do you think I should trust her?
