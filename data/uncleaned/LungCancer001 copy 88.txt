retuning with the results ( adnocarconmia)I dont have to much to say and still maybe still in a bit of shock this is all happeninglast week I checked into the hosp because I just could not breath well enough to get around my own apt. the next morning after ct results I was urged by a pulmonoligest to get a biopsy - I did this and the cancer was found in both lungs . after a MRI confirmed into my brain as wellI have been told by my dr I am not going to get a cure , but perhaps some shrinking and some more "time" as for this time frame they give me no clueI started chemo ( one round) and now doing radiaton , once a day for ten daysafter that chemo is to restart . once every 3 weeks. I have talked to others who are getting alot more chemo then this. I have not asked my dr why mine is so differnt.I was told my cancer appears more like tiny dots or a cloud so maybe that is why.IDK ,, they ask me if I have questions and my mind just goes blankI have to move to be with family , my breathing wont allow me to work or really even take care of myself. when all this started I was and always have been for that matter a small thin personand now over the last month lost 20 pounds putting me apx 120 at 5'9''so "skinny" to say the least. I have been eating pretty well and try to make my self eat but still I seem to be loosing. trying to stay positivethe point of this post ? IDK ,, get it out there off my chest -tell someone who might understandget some support.. all of the above maybe ...thank you all who take your time to read and replyyour wisdom, thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated
