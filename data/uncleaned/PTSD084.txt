Why Do Only Some Traumas Create Ptsd?Ok so I've been mulling over this since i woke this morning. And I've wondered in a general manner as to why in the case of multiple trauma only some things cause PTSD. For me the things that have caused my PTSD have been sexual abuse as a child by a family member and a rape and sexual assault when I was 14 by a man twice my age. Yet I went on to be raped again several times by a boyfriend when I was 17 in quite a humiliating manner. These last attacks though, have not caused PTSD even though they were more sustained and in my mind were more damaging than what happened when I was 14. Don't get me wrong it had an effect on me but not in the same way that the others have created a disorder with all the fun stuff that comes with it.Why is it that someone can be witness to horrific things and not all of them have the same effect? I understand that things can accumulate and it may be the last straw so to speak. But what about when a traumatic event happen afterwards and don't have the same lasting effect?Any thoughts?
