No one left for meLost childMy life wasn’t typically unhappy until I was about 15 or 16. I had my first heart break, same old story. But ever since then it’s been this little nagging in the back of my head. “Why didn’t you just kill yourself that night?” It always.always. Came back to my mom.i couldn’t do that to her, I couldn’t make her find my body, make her mourn her only child. I stayed strong, went to counseling, tried to be “normal”. But now, she’s gone, the only person in this world who ever truly loved me. I have no one no mourn my loss now. I have no friends, my family hates me and blames me for her death, my most meaningful relationship just ended. For the last year since her death I’ve told everyone how strong I am, and I’m not. I am weak. I can’t make it without her
