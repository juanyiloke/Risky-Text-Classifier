I need advice on what to to about undiagnosed and ignored schizophrenia syptomsI have no doubt that I am schixophrenic. I hallucinate often and I am constantly EXTREMELY paranoid.I ran away for several hours last month because of the voices in my head. I wanted to get away from them and the people I was seeing, but it was unsuccessful. My parents do not see anything wrong, and when I mentioned the hallucinations, they called me insane and insulted me.I don't know what to do. I am also extremely depressed and constantly thinking about suicide (though not suicidal). What should I do?
