My cry for help. (possible trigger)Hello all!One week ago today I got so frustrated that my cognitive impairments (see previous posts) were getting worse, and I felt like the zoloft was making me worse that I reached my breaking point and took 25 1mg klonopin. It was more a cry for help then me wanting to die. I have so much I want to live for, but at that moment I couldn't think of anything but to end the pain I was in emotionally.I was in the hospital for a week. I am now on new medications that I'm hopeful will help get my anxiety and depression under control, and hopefully regain all of my cognitive abilities. My doctor in the hospital did warn me that there could be some permanent damage to my brain from the overdose, but he started me on a magnesium supplement which is supposed to help repair the possible damage.ÊWhile in the hospital I had a bunch of testing done. One of which was an ANA and a C-reactive protein screening. Both of these tests came back elevated. The doctor in the hospital said that the possible causes of these results could mean a number of things including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other auto immune diseases. I have to wait to get a referral to a rheumatologist in the next couple of weeks.ÊI am definitely nervous and anxious about the test results, but learned some new coping methods in the hospital. I've also enrolled in some anxiety support classes. I'm hopeful that everything will work out for the best.ÊI just wanted to check in and let everyone know to have hope and be patient. Anxiety is very scary and you can easily lose sight of you ever recovering, but I'm here to tell you that you WILL recover! It just is going to take a lot of time, patience, determination, and dedication.
