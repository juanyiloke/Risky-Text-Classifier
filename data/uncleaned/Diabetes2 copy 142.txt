Lloyds diabetes testHello everyone,I am wondering about these free tests at Lloyds. Ours is a small local pharmacy and I don't really want to have to discuss things in front of other customers. Do they take you somewhere private? I do have a sibling with Type 2, am very overweight, nearly 50 and for the past week have been feeling woozy and lightheaded for a few hours each day, even when sitting. I do exercise but constantly fail with my diet. This year I have lost 7-10 lbs on three separate occasions but have put it back on each time so I am exactly where I was 12 months ago. I do drink a lot, tea or diet fizzy drinks, but always have done.
