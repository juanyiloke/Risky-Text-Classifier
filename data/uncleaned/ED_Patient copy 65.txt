I need some help for my friend..I'm getting really concerned over my friend, her eating habit is awful, all she eats is cereal and chocolate, maybe the odd time she will have a chicken or egg sandwhich.Lately she's been feeling sick all the time and shaking with back pains, I've told her she needs to eat more vitamins and try new healthy foods but she just won't do it. I just need some answers on why she's feeling like this? I've been her friend all her life and I can see her going downhill and it's getting me worried. Many thanks.
