Glucose monitoring   My son has type 1 diabetes- he was diagnosed 5 years ago now. His HbA1cs have been extremely good ranging from 5.1 to 6.8- these results have been achieved by hard work and careful monitoring of blood glucose at least four times every day. Use of blood glucose monitoring is essential in insulin dependant diabetes- it is the only way (in the absence of continuous monitoring) to get results to work with and detect trends- prevention of complications and dibaetic ketoacidosis can only save the NHS money!!From my conversations with type 2 diabetics I believe that monitoring of blood glucose also allows for the detection of trends and the effect of food and exercise on levels- we are light years behind the US where type 2's routinely test and many people use pumps.
