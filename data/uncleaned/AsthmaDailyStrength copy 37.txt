Hi, Newbie here. A little bit about me: I've always had asthma. When I was little it was pretty severe. I was hospitalized many times. I got into my late teens and it seemed to go away. I got chicken pox when I was 21 (I'm 25 now) and my lungs got scarred and I became allergic to so many foods. I didn't know what was happening at first. Anyway long story I've almost, literally died 3 times and people still don't understand. By people I mean family. They don't understand my allergies because I've never had them before. I help my in laws and family a lot with physical work every year for this event we have every summer. I'm sure that caused one of my hospitalizations and I shouldn't have done it but because no one took my health seriously I wondered too if it was serious. Stupid I know. Anyway I don't want to keep ranting but how do you keep your anger in check? Or deal with people who don't get it even when they've seen you lying in a hospital bed more than once? My MIL and husband understand the most and have compassion but they still don't fully get it. I think it's actually my fault cause I've not stood up for myself.
