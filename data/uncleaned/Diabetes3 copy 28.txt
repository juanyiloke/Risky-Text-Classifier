Help pleaseMy son has had a virus for a few days, cough and cold. Seems to be on the mend, no temperature and eating and drinking normally.As he is on mixed insulin impossible to give correction doses but BS have not been much higher than 12 or 13. However, this morning he is almost 15 and checked ketones and they are high, in between the two darkest on the side of the pot. Spoke to DN who didn't seem unduly concerned but said keep testing and call again. Not sure whether I should take him to A and E
