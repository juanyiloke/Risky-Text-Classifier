Ideas need for weekend with buddyA friend of mine is rather seriously down in the dumps at the moment. I'll spare you the details but basically he has lost his mojo (I don't mean sexually).Anyway, I offered to go away for a weekend with him to try and lift his spirits a bit (I'm not expecting miracles here). Problem is I have no idea what we could do for a weekend together. I asked him what he'd like to do and he said 'I don't care, I'll leave it up to you' (as I said he has lost his mojo).Some guidelines:NOT looking for a dirty lads weekend type suggestions.In general he is not an active type but would not be averse to mild activity.In Ireland and affordable (I know that's relative)ÊThanks
