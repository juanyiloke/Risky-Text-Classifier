Why carry on?When you stare at the same four walls every day, it really makes you wonder why you continue to exist at all. People tell you to hang on for just one more day, but that turns into months, and years, and decades, and you wonder where the time went, and things just get worse and worse. Any way I can think of to get out of this mess, to change my life around, it always seems to come to a dead end. No matter how hard I try, these feelings will not go away. So why continue living a pointless life? Isn't it easier to just give up when you seem to be facing insurmountable odds?
