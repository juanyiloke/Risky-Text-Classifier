I have had major side effects to the inhailer Symbicort. Last year, my old pulmonolgist put me on a low dosage of this. A week after taking this, I was in screaming pain from nerophathy. Went to the ER, and then was referred to a neurologist. For a year, I would go back to the advair until I ran out of the prescription. She just wouldn't listen to me when I told her, that I was having side effects with this drug. Recently, new dr, he gave me a sample to try, we are trying new thing, I mentioned, I didn't like the Sybicort because I thought it was not strong enough, not even knowing that the neuropathy was related. So....I am now on the highest dosage of Symbicort. For two days, I was having shooting and painfull nerve pain in my limbs with twitching of my mucsles and cramping. I was so weak all day yesterday and in major pain. I called the pharmasist. The confirmed, that in less than 3% have nerve pain, fibromyligia, in the limbs with muscle twitching and cramping in the limbs. I immediately called my dr. He said, "THROW IT AWAY!" It has only been out for 5 years and since it is a new drug, there have not been enough studies on it, we will never try that again. Thank God I have a great Doctor! I thought it was funny that every time I took this stuff, I had nerve and joint pain. I am just putting this out there, because someone else my be having these symptoms and not realize it is the Sybicort. I am sure that others won't have this reaction, but if you are that 3%, than you need to know it is the Symibcort and it is not in your head!
