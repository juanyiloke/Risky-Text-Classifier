Have't been around for a whileHithis is my first post in months..this time last year I was just finishing my chemoradiotheray...snce then I've had surgery, with an ileostomy and adjuvant chemo - which was stopped after 4 cycles of oxaliplatin and 6 of capecitabine (didn't finish any of the capecitabine cycles and was admitted nearly every time with explosive diarrhoea)Just had my post treatment scans and oncology appointment and news is good - NED...after what seems like a year thats gone on forever, thats the first piece of good news...I'm now down to see the surgeon regarding a reversal in 3 weeks time..Just wanted to say that a year ago everything seemed to be looming in front of me but, staying positive has helped me get through it and now, finally, there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel
