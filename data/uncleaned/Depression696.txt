Coping with work?Started by heterochromia?, 13-01-15 04:45 PMHow do you cope with work? I loathe it. Last thing on earth I want to do is go to work. Not because I'm lazy but because I just want to stop at home where i'm comortable and safe. I plead with my partner to let me stay at home most days, he thinks I'm always joking but I'm very serious. I have to work otherwise I'd be homeless and I have people relying on me. The government says I'm fine to work and threw me off incapacity benefit. The drudge of working every day just makes things so much worse. It adds to the knowledge that I know there is no point in life and this is all meaningless. Just wondered if any of you had coping mechanisms for it.
