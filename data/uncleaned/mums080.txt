Hi just wanted to ask for some advice on how best to handle and help my DS as his behaviour has changed a lot since we brought home his baby brother.He's 5 years old and this is his first sibling so he's used to being an only child. At first he didn't take to his brother at all, was saying we didn't love him anymore (he mostly seemed to be bothered by his dad's attention) and we've left it to see if it would ease and it has in that respect in that he now will kiss his brother and be interested but his behaviour has changed dramatically.His behaviour has become a mix of being extremely silly and challenging or sullen and withdrawn. He's also become argumentative, is lying a lot about silly things, is often unhappy to talk and is basically either very clingy or won't come near us. He's always been a good sleeper too but the last few days he's been an absolute nightmare to settle!I know he's attention seeking and is probably feeling insecure. We've both been making an effort to have quality time with him and i've been trying to talk to him/cuddle him a lot but we're both finding it hard as of course it's when we're the most tired/stressed with the newborn that he's challenging and our patience can run quite thin.. then the guilt comes!I'm assuming it's pretty normal for their behaviour to change when their lives change like this but would like to know how is best to deal/help him as sometimes I feel so awful and I don't want to get stuck in a downward spiral
