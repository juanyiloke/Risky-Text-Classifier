Friend with an eating disorderI have a friend that has an eating disorder. I try to make her comfortable whenever we hangout. If we eat she always decides what we have so she's comfortable eating. I found out she gets upset whenever we have food when we hangout. I'm trying to be a good friend, but also make sure she doesn't get sick by not eating. What can I do to become a better friend for her? I want to help her do well, but she hates me in a way for promoting her wellness
