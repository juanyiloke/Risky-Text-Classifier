Which UK Universities have the majority of Pakistani, Indian and Bengali people? (Pgs: 1 2 3)by arqi786Hi! I was just wondering which universities (in the UK) have the most Pakistani, Indian and Bengali people and that too with the lowest amount of white people?Do universities like University College London, Kings College London and Bristol have lots of Pakistanis/Indians/Bengalis?I'm only asking because I've never seemed to make many white friends at my previous schools (where the majority of people were white) and now I want to go to a uni where I can actually talk to people, make friends and fit in!! There's nothing wrong with lots of white people but I do feel a bit excluded, mainly because i can't exactly go to many parties, drink etc..
