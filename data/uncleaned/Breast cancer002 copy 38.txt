Lumpectomy done...Hoorah...Onward and upward ;-)¥	Hi everyone,¥	A bit sore and a bit black and blue but relieved to have begun the process finally.So .....  now for the 2 week wait before finding out what next , but at least the treatment has started, so a huge step forward. I was told because it was a large lump that It will probably be Rads, Chemo and Herceptine. Whatever it takes eh people.¥	Thank you for all the Birthday wishes......it was a bit of a weird one this year but next year is going to be a doozy!¥	Hugs xx¥	Ps (Daft  joke)¥	 I went to a zoo the other day and they only had one dog there...I think it was a shitzoo !!!
