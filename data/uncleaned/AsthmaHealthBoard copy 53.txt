Asthma Is Frustrating!________________________________________Whenever it seems I have my asthma under control I eventually eventually start having flare ups. Today, I was fine under I walked to get a veggie burger and fries. It's very humid out and as soon as I went outside again I felt really short of breath even while waiting for the walk light so I used my inhaler which didn't really help too much. I walked around a grocery store and a few things nothing really heavy. To get to my apartment building I have to walk up a slight hill which only made me feel even worse as if there's a weight on my chest. I used my symbicort a few minutes earlier hoping it would help but so far it hasn't helped much. I'm scared to use ventolin(albuterol) again because the last time I didn't space the extra doses apart I experienced chest pain and a very fast heart rate. I'm not sure if it was related to the ventolin or not since another time I had two dosages within half an hour of each other and never had the same symptoms.I don't have a nebulizer. Maybe I'll wait a little longer and try my ventolin(albuterol) if I still feel this weight on my chest. It's harder to breathe with this pressure.
