Severe anxiety Ê17    Hi folks I have severe anxiety both socially and health I'm 30 years old and this is my first time joining these forums.Just wondering has anyone ever overcome this at present I am currently doing CBT and I'm trying to stay away from medication as I have read about the awful side effects. I am considering paying privately for an MRI scan of my brain as I have extreme tiredness, brain fog, my concentration skills and memory is really bad! I have severe headaches where I am unable to focus.As for the social anxiety where do I start I can not hold a conversation anymore I get really nervous and I know that it makes people feel ackward I have now notice that I feel as if I'm swaying when I walk into a room I try to avoid all social gatherings!Please tell me that other people have dealt with similar situations.
