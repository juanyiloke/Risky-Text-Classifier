Chest tightness at start of cold /chest infection  7  I'm 60, had asthma for just over 3 years, which started after a persistent bout of bronchitis. I take Seretide twice daily. I try to run regularly when I'm able, but I'm never quite sure how I should respond at the onset of normal cold symptoms. Once I have any degree of cold infection, I regularly experience chest tightness and discomfort immediately, almost before any cold symptoms have established. I'm not really sure what the best strategy is to get rid of the chest tightness, prevent the cold developing and enable me to continue exercising. I try increasing my inhaler dose, take extra vitC, etc but without great success. I'd really value hearing how others deal with this, is it just a case of putting up with it, or should I be able to nip it in the bud?
