Finding a job...2012-11-15, 02:48 AMI don't know if it's me, but I've never been able to land a better job than telemarketer or dishwasher, and I'm 25. I have had temp jobs at better paying department stores and retail outlets before, though seasonal and they never last. I always get disqualified by those pre-employment screening tests, psychological exams and questionairres. Are there right/wrong answers? If I use cheat sheets, I fail them, if I answer them honestly and consistently, I sure as hell will fail them.What am I doing wrong? That I can't even land a decent sh*tty job...
