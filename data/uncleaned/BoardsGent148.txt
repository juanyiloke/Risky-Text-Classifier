New shoesCouldn't find a thread about casual shoes here but if there is one already someone might post a link please.TLDR: Can someone recommend some smart casual shoes for jeans and a shirt?Recently I have changed my whole style. I wear a suit in work so I always just wore jeans, runners and t-shirts when I was out and about. And just hoodies and trackies at home. I have changed to a smart casual look for when I go out over the last few months and feel better already. Bought some nice shirts, knitted tops, jackets and some quality jeans and trousers. The trouble is I can't find any shoes that I like or feel comfortable wearing and they are the only missing piece.I always hated wearing shoes, even in school and I still hate wearing them in work but going out all dressed up with my girlfriend and having a pair of white runners ruining the outfit isn't good. So guys, any help in the shoe department is appreciated. Black preferably.
