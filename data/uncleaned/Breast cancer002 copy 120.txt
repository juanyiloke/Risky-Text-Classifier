Strange day¥	Hi all, mixed emotions today walking out the hospital having just had my last radiotherapy, i said yes ive done it finished mt treatment, as soon as i got home my son congratulates me and i burst into tears!, so up and down,i feel mentally in a stronger place now having been totally consumed with getting over chemo,i think i have reached that light at the end of the tunnel and can start breathing again. Im working longer hrs now too but im still taking my time and not rushing. Gotta  wait now for the next 10 days of burning  and tiredness to kick in and hopefully be ok. The end of the road feels scary like unknown territory but im happy to take slow steps into the future, at the moment i actually feel like me.....next step reconstruction thx all xbevx
