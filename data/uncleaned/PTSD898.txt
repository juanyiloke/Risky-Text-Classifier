Êfed upI have had PTSD for 5 years, took 3 1/2 years to get referred for help, had to wait for a year on waiting list and by then was such a mess that the 26 weeks treatment the health authority allowed was mostly spent trying to get me in a suitable state for treatment, the aim being for me to have EMDR. Tried a session of it but with buzzy things in my hands not eye movements. Then my allocation run out so got to have 6 months theraputic break before I go on waiting list again but only get 18 sessions this time.ÊI go to a support group for anxiety and depression but gradually I am coping less and less. The group has a mix of people and at least one of the volunteers plainly doesn't like me, one of the group users is a strange woman who seems to disapprove of everuthing I say. I don't think I am being paranoid, so the support I get from the group is limited.ÊTwenty years ago I had very severe post natal depression brought on in the main by my husbands family, we haven't seen or spoken to them for 17 years but suddenly they have popped up and some of them want to be friends again and I can't cope.My PTSD is about doctors/hospitals/form filling/bleeding/vulnerability. Now I feel as though "me" has left the building. Ever since his family reappeared.ÊI feel totally empty inside, can't hold a cpnversation, don't want to speak to anyone in the flesh or on phone, won't go out. If I watch TV then the flashbacks to my PTSD come thick and fast far worse than normal.ÊI have not got the energy for this. Don't understand the logic of spending 26 weeks getting me ready to open up then dumping me and letting me get ill again. Don't know what is happening, why I have switched off, don't know how to fight back anymore.Does any of this make sense to any one?
