GP practice refusal to give repeatDoes anyone else have very rude GP practice?I submitted my usual request online for insulin and received an email back saying that they wont let me have it as my annual checks are due!! I called them and asked why, they said they will do it this once but if I don't have a blood test and see the nurse before the next one is due they will not prescribe any more insulin. I work full time and struggle to make appointments in the day due to location plus they will only prescribe for a month at a time which is frustrating. Can they threaten me like this?ThanksPaul
