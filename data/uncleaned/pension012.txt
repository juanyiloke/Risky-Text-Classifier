Menace on the roads!Once again (down here) a major road shut by the overturning of a caravan. These things really are a menace on the roads. Most "towers" have had no formal training in towing and therefore have no idea what to do if things start to go wrong! Often they come out once a year for that ""holiday" and cause chaos on our roads! There should be a compulsory driving training and test for anybody who wants to tow a trailer or caravan on our roads! That anybody can just drive into a caravan sales area and drive out towing one is plain crazy!
