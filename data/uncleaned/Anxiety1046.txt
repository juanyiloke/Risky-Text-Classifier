Anxiety vs. ParanoiaI have been diagnosed with anxiety for a few years now. I wrote down what I was experiencing in my mind as I was waiting to see my doctor. Reading it a few times has made me question if it's really just anxiety or something more complex?ÊI worry that people can hear my thoughts, feel my emotions. I constantly feel as if someone is watching me. I keep Windows closed, closet open just in case someone is trying to hide. I open the shower curtain to make sure no one's hiding. I will sometimes think my food is bad. It even gets as bad as my cat is really a person under cover or even that someone is on the other side of the mirror looking at me.. I often can't sleep at night because creatures could be hidden in the darkness, I sleep in the day because I feel safer that way. I constantly feel like I'm in a dream and almost as if I'm floating.. I'm slowly losing my grip on reality..Êsorry this is so long.if you don't mind providing me with opinions.
