Eye damage/no eye damage. Confused.So I had another eye test yesterday. Admittedly it wasn't where they put drops in your eyes at the hospital. But she looked extensively to see if there was damage. She couldn't see any. In fact, the only thing is that I'm straining my eyes because of all my computer work and my right eye has a slight stigmatism. But she couldn't see any damage at all. Does that mean that whatever damage they wrote to me about after my last hospital eye scan is so minimal its almost nothing? Becky
