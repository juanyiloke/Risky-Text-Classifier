no longer able to throw upGawd this is difficult. Ok I'm mid 40's  think I'm happy have a ok job, married and enjoy a beer wiv me buddies twice a week BUT for as long as I can remember when ever I'm on my own ie at home I EAT FOR England. I eat 8 plus sandwiches 4 choc bars a micro dinner (throw up) then pasties pies ltrs of coke until I feel like I gonna pass out then throw up an do it again until someone comes home :-(its now come to the stage where no matter how hard I try when I make myself sick only acid water comes up and no food (sorry) I'm obviously piling on the pounds have chronic acid reflux and every few days feel like I'm gonna die. First time I put anything out like this but think its time for advise.
