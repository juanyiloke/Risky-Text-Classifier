What suicide means to me.To me the thought of suicide, while very disturbing to most people, is very much a source of comfort during my tough, depressive times. I'll explain why- Sometimes situations get so tough to deal with when you have severe depression. Your emotions and pain can become so extreme, that no Earthly solution seems to be strong or effective enough to stop the pain. Pretty much every time I find myself getting to this point, the thought of suicide seems to be the only possible solution that would 100% get rid of my pain. Just the thought that there is actually a fool-proof, sure-fire solution to end the depression and pain makes things better for me. This does not mean that I'm going to do it. But sometimes when I'm to my lowest points, I like to lay down, shut my eyes, and imagine that I don't exist, that I'm free of all the pain. It is a very comforting thought for me. I know it seems strange to some, but I'm a believer that we are all individually different and think/see things differently. Suicide is basically the solution to my pain and tough times that I envision when I can't possibly think of a single other solution that would help at all (which often times is the case).The thing about it is though, I believe all or most of us who suffer from severe depression view the thought of suicide as comforting. After all, most of us eventually wind up at that conclusion. That's the whole reason why, when we are to our lowest point, we reach for the solution we think will end the pain, which is often suicide. We arrive at the thought of suicide because it is a source of comfort to our minds. We are looking for solutions to our pain, and the concept of suicide offers them.I'm not endorsing suicide. I'm merely explaining how my mind thinks about it, and why I believe suicide is often the thought/action of severely depressed people.
