Saving for a house in the UK.2014-02-09, 03:47 PMThe discussion of saving money to buy a house soon came up today. To recap I'm 23, and I am 6-7 months into full-time employment after attending University for the past 4 years. My plan is to set up a direct debit that "pinches" the money from my account shortly after I'm paid.ÊWhatever money that I currently earn, I manage to waste within the month, so this shouldn't really be a problem to save. My only concern is, I guess I'm not excited about saving money for it to sit in an account. I want the money that I save to "work for me". Does anybody have any good advice regarding saving?Don't pray when it rains, if you don't pray when the sun shines *
