A Job And Starting PaySo I left a really good paying job (~$60K) a few years ago to explorer other options, as I was burned out in my position working at a computer help desk. I had a lowly admin position at an engineer firm, and then spent 5 quarters studying electronics and PLCs at a tech college. The fifth quarter is when I my relapse stated. I'm recovering now, 2 months into med hell, but think I am close to be going for a job. I really feel that I need to get a job to get me back on my feet, to get me out of the house. Right now, I have morning anxiety and don't sleep through the night, but then again, I don't do much during the day. What I wanted to ask for was opinions. I need to get a job that I can do (40hrs max, in town, no weekend/eve). I do have a BA. At what pay should I be looking at? I do need medical benefits as this self-pay with $4K deductible sucks. Should I resort to retail, or hold out? In some ways I am burned out with computers, as I ended up in computer support the past decade and lost any and all programming or server admin skills. Any ideas of a type of job?Edit: There are no jobs in town for electronics. Or at least that I have found. Can anyone share their experience of being out ill, and then going back into the workforce, and what you had to consider or experienced? Thanks!!!-IB
