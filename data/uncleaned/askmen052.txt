Work attitude vs experience2013-08-21, 01:25 PMCan good attitude/ mindset toward work initially substitute for lack of experience? If you were an employer, would you be eager to employ someone that doesn`t have much experience but is hard working and willing to learn or would you rather employ someone with years of experience?I have read in a book that employers should not only look at employee`s work experience but also at their personality, goals, mindset towards work and how do they treat their co-workers in general. There was also mentioned that if they see that the person is eager to learn and not a slacker, that the "beginner" should be given the same opportunity as an experienced person mainly because skills can be taught over a period of time but personality can`t be changed.What`s your take?
