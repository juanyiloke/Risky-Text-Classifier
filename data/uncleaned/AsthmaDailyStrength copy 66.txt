I went to my doctor last week because I have had a pretty bad cough with activity and he did a breathing test and said I failed it, so I must have bronchitis or something going on. Last year when I had this he gave me an inhaler and a prescription for a home nebulizer. The last few nights when I used the nebulizer I have been shaky, rapid heart rate, and light headed. Is this normal? It is albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide (the medicine I put in the nebulizer). I am supposed to use the inhaler once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I am afraid to use the nebulizer again....it makes me very scared, Should I just stop using it? Does this sound like asthma, upper respiratory infection (no fever) or just plain old bronchitis?
