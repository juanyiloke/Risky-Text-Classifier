Still around! Hi all, its been 2years now since my RP & one or two of you may remember me on the old forum.Well I'm still here with my latest hospital appointment today my PSA is still 0.02. Every thing is good apart from the ED side of thing but muddling thro (more than one way to skin a cat!)Not been on here much as i find this new forum still VERY difficult for me to navigate round. I keep trying since the change but still cannot get the hang of it!Any tips to nav round this difficult forum??????fenman
