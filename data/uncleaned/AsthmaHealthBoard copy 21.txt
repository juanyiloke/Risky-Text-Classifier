Rescue inhaler almost everyday________________________________________HiI am taking a lot of medications on a Daily basis plus I need my rescue inhaler almost everyday.I get short of breath and chest tightness and coughing just from walking.I have already given up x country skiing and curling.I am so tired. I am trying to do some walking at a local mall but I am just worn out. It just seems an effort to breathe after mild exertion.Any ideas or comments.
