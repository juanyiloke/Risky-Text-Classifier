Breakfast and Metabolic Control - T2 (no medication)I've just read the article about this based on recent research and can offer anecdotal evidence to support the findings.I have T2. I'm not on medication.The advice I've had from health people is that I should have 3 small meals a days, consisting of a starchy carb, protein, fruit/ veg, and 2 small snacks in between meals. I was told that this will keep my BG at a steady level but it doesn't work, however careful I am about carbs. What I have found is that if I eat more at breakfast and less throughout the rest of the day I feel better, I don't get hungry so quickly, and my BG levels don't fluctuate as widely. It seems logical to me to eat more at the start of the day having fasted overnight for 10/12 hours.
