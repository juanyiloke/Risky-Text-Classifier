Do I have Asthma please help?  2  So suddenly I woke up the next day with a pain in my chest. The problem is I'm not sure if the pain is in my chest or throat I feel like its between my throat and chest just like lower throat and upper chest. I only feel the pain when I try to take a deeep breath, when I take a deep breath I feel a pain in between my throat and chest but mainly (I think) my throat. I never had breathing difficulties in breathing before. I had rare pain sometimes on my ribs I don't know just slight pain once every 4-5 months something like that. I workout excerise play sport normally without any problem. so please let me know is this a being for Asthma?
