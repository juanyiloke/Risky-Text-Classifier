Hence far, no major moods todaySo it's been a few hours, but i got up early. Managed to get 5 hours of sleep. Saw my nephew, and played with him. (1.4 years)I see my doc today, not to excited there. But i'm not tired/sore. Or dealing with rapid heart beat/energy.Mood wise, it's been fairly base-line, a little higher than normal, but situational "high" i actually feel optimistic for once. It's early, but i'll try to keep it going. Woke up, took niacin with fish oil. By the way, ask your doc/pharmacist before taking any medication/supplements. Been taking that combo for a few days now. It sort of helps with hallucinations for me. Except after no sleep binges. Then it helps negate the severity. But yea, "i can't believe today was a good day"
