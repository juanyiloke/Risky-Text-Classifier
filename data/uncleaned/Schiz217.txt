I haven't been active in a while. I thought I was getting better. And I was in some ways. But I think I might be deteriorating in another way?? While my hallucinaitons are under control and brought to a minimum, my thoughts are completely screwed. I'm having a really hard time writing and typing and forming coherent sentences as compared to before. But this is something that has progressed just in this year. I am dissociating more, a couple days ago I thought I was tripping on acid because I was feeling so strange with no reason.I don't really know if it's possible for only one aspect to get worse over time when the more positive symptoms have reduced?
