OK - I admitted defeat .... and bought a BP monitor!Had it done again today, Systolic in the 150s.  (Diastolic OK 67 was the highest, Pulse consistently low-mid 70s so also OK)So asked for next available appointment - March 16th, Whaaat? So said it was my BP, today at 1.50.So went back after lunch, saw doc, she says too early to make changes and I'd be better off testing at home every 3 ish days, plod through morning, next one afternoon, next one evening etc for a while and then see what that tells us.  Then tells me (no-one has before) that they sell Omrons in the surgery pharmacy at about £!5 !  And Lo they do.  £16.99 to be precise.  It's the Pro- Logic and what they use at the pharmacy and in the Docs anyway!  Takes 4 triple As and I have shedloads of them anyway.Ah well !  back in 3 weeks she says so I forgot to book that, will try online tomorrow.anyway - notices everywhere for 'Important changes at the surgery from Ist April - Ask at reception'.  I asked and was handed two small slips of paper.One says if you want any test results you have to ring on a Tuesday afternoon between certain hours otherwise you can't have them, the other says you can only request Repeat prescriptions in writing or online.  Not by speaking on the phone or asking direct at reception.  If not online, on a form, available on request .... from reception. GP service  ??  What ruddy service is that then ?  I was actually in a Service Industry all my working life.  I'm used to responding almost instantly.  Otherwise -  I got my arse kicked !There is Good News however - see Pump section.
