Hello, I am a student doing research on PTSD/TBI. In the course of reading through a lot of materials and looking for research participants, I noticed that people often have different triggers and react in different ways. But then, it also became clear that a lot of people had not really thought about what actually triggers them. I am hoping to hear what triggers you and how you deal with it. That way, we might be able to help someone else deal with a trigger or similar situation. Thanks! P.S - If interested in participating in my study please check out the research section.
