Trust Me I'm a DoctorThis programme was on BBC2 tonight (15/10/14) & although I wasn't going to watch it as I pretty much don't trust any doctors very much, my Mum phoned me & made me promise I would watch it on 'catch-up'.Now although I already knew about resistant starch & that saturated fat is not the enemy, it was amazing to see it being said on mainstream tv.They even said that all starchy food, potatoes, bread, rice, pasta etc raises everybody's BG's very quickly, incredible
