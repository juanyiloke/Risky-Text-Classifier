Teaching English--don't want to charge________________________________________Have this in another forum also, probably not the right forum again! Feel free to move!Today my work colleague who is Polish asked me if I would help her learn English. I agreed (coz I love languages! and Polish-I try to learn a little!) and (she had asked another girl in work who agreed, then after a week, said she couldn't teach her) So she says, is 10euro per hour enough? I said, no way, I'm not helping you if you are going to charge me..but she is insisting.I really want to help her, but I don't want to get paid for it. I'm not qualified, so it'd be so informal. I said, you can pay me with cups of tea and she is adamant that she will pay me with money.How can I compromise? I don't want money, but I want to help her. Also, I said, sure I'd be learning Polish in return so it's a win win. And I said, you're a friend, I don't want your money. She won't let me help her unless she pays me. She has a house and a family to run. I don't have commitments so I don't need the money. If anything, it gets me out of the house (when I'm not working)Any suggestions/compromises?Thanks
