GAD vs (some kind of) "Panic Attack Disorder" diagnosis?I'm still learning about my "condition(s)"... I'm starting to question my diagnosis, I guess it probably happens quite often, getting a diagnosis label and it may not be always correct?Ê dunno...Ê I'm finding that what I thought I understand about something, i've been confused all this time.can GAD and Panic Attacks go "together", one sparking the other, etc?Ê An event causes a Panic Attack, after which causes extreme anxiety/paranoia? I am not normally a "paranoid" person, but something as simple as having my HOA (lets not get started on how terrible Home Owner's Associations are) tow my car push me to "paranoia" that they and/or other people are screwing with me/my property.Ê this is just the most recent example... but this even going so far as to become agoraphobic?ÊI have a psych apt in about three weeks, and I have such a short time with her I want to try to hash together the conversation before going in
