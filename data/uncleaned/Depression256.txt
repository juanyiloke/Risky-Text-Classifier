 I'm back.  Mrssarawright, 2  So I was told by the gp that I have postnatal depression, all in all I agree with him. I didn't at first but I now look back and realize that I probably do. I have 3 children 6,3 & my youngest being 7 months old. & I love them all lots. I have had spouts of depression over the years since I was 12. I don't even know where to begin, I feel so bad that I'm constantly angry especially at my 6 year old, she doesn't deserve to be shouted at for petty things. My youngest is hard work, she was a colicky baby & a poorly baby (meaning she catches colds like nothing) so she's hard work anyway. I'm being medicated for it but it's not touching it ATM. I hate myself for thinking that my youngest is a massive chore that I have to do. No mother should ever think that about her child so why do I think it. I used to SH and over the years I was able to cope without it. But at this very moment every day is a struggle not to listen to that little voice telling me I'm worthless and should do the deed.  I want to think positive for my 3 children but all I want to do is crawl up in bed and sleep. I can't do this however as I don't have the time. I'm running myself into a hole. I'm finding it really hard
