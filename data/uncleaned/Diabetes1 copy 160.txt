I'm going from Type 1 to Type 2.. bit of a suprise after 2yrs2 yrs ago I was rushed into hospital with all the classic symptoms.. thirst, weight loss etc to be diagnosed as Type 1 and I've been on insulin ever since.I've always had good control except during exercise when I've had to take silly amounts of carb to keep my levels up so after discussion recently with the diabetes team I stopped taking background insulin completely.. my levels stayed as before. They organised some blood test to be sure and the results are in...Seems I'm type 2 not type 1.. be stopping injections and going onto tablets once a day.. that's a bit of a shock I can tell you!!Has anyone ever heard of this before?Thanks
