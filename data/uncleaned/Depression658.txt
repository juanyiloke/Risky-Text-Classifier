Binge eating because of depressionStarted by PS89?, 08-03-15 01:02 PMHi I am new to this but I really need someone to talk to because nobody seems to understand how I am feeling I have been depressed and been on tablets for about 9 years for it and I have always coped before now I joined slimming world a year ago and have lost 7 stone and spend most days in the gym, so I hardly see my friends or family and I am so miserable all the time I don't want to see anyone I just want to spend my time on my own, I feel so guilty when I am sat still like I should be burning calories, I don't eat anything unhealthy, but when I do I lose control I don't know what kicks it off but sometimes I am not happy unless I have got something in my mouth whether it is a drink or food its like there is a rope pulling me into the kitchen and I am not happy unless I am eating and this can go on for hours especially if I have had a drink, I feel embarrassed so tend to eat on my own, I know its to do with my emotions I have so much to be excited about I am moving to Australia for a year in 6 weeks so I haven't got time to go to the doctors for counselling I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this problem and can help me????
