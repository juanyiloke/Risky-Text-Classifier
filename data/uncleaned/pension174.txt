Bank BonusesBank BonusesThe reason that the RBS & Lloyds bank bonuses are unforgivable is not because they had to use taxpayers money to survive the problems caused by their own feckless greed.It is because they have caused real life tragedy to millions of people who are suffering untold financial hardships.This is something that an employed person can never understand.Unemployment brings with it; repossessed homes, broken families, canceled holidays,  means tested benefits & a  loss of self esteem.Giving bankers bonuses is like pouring salt into the wounds of the deprived.And likely to cause enough bitterness & resentment to fire a revolution.
