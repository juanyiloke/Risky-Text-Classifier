ÊIs what we do during Psychosis "the real me" ?Hello.ÊAnother member kindly replied to an earlier thread of mine by saying :- When I was psychotic I did all kinds of terrible things. Things the real me would never even consider doing. I pray that my wrong doings will be forgiven but I understand if they aren't.I mentioned that during psychosis I did things that were totally against my principles and high moral values. That especially if I heard voices or had panic attacks then I often could not control my impulses and I would do something that was wrongful eg not causing physical harm but I would send texts to friends at 4am with cries for help and lots of things that would cause distress to others.ÊPeople I know have said about me that this past year they do not recognise the person I have become because of my totally uncharacteristic behavior. I have replied that when I have been very unwell (psychotic - hallucinations, anxiety - panic attacks) that I am not thinking rationally and what I think and do while psychotic is not "the real me". But they dont understand.ÊDo you ever look back at what you have said or done when psychotic and said "that is not the real me" ? Or am I and the other member wrong and it is rhe real person ? Do you feel the same ?Have you said the exact same words to people ( its not the real me) but they dont understand ?ÊGod bless you for reading even if you dont reply.
