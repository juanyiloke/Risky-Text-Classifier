This isn't going to be a long one at all, just a really quick rant at life. I've had asthma since I was 6, and it has only gotten worse with time. It started pretty simple, just a problem if I run for a long time. But in the past year or two it's gotten to the point where I can't run for more than 10 minutes or so without a full on asthma attack. It makes me feel just so inadequete in gym when I can't do warmups without having to run in to the locker room and sit down. We did the pacer test today, and I got 6 laps in before actually passing out in the locker room. I'm just so pissed that I can't exercise like a normal person without having an asthma attack.
