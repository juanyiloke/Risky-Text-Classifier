Must a therapist report this (YEARS AGO)?by JPOCD » Sun Nov 16, 2014 5:52 amGrowing up, I was talked into sexual acts with teenagers who were family, neighbors and friends. They were all older, but I wasn't a small child. I was probably around 13 and they were usually around 16. They would talk me into blowing them, and others just wanted to blow me. Many times we would do mutual masturbation as well. At that age, it was a time of exploration for me, just hitting puberty. But, like I said, I was talked into doing these things, and each one of us never spoke of it to anyone. Eventually, I was wanting to experiment with my friends who were the same age. It's like I had to have it every time we were alone and they wanted it too. I feel like if I had never been talked into doing these acts with the older guys, that I wouldn't have had to have it later on with my friends whom were the same age. I'm currently seeing a therapist for other things. If I bring this up, will they have to report this? It was over 29 years ago and this is not why I'm seeing the therapist. Due to health problems, I can no longer have sex or even masturbate nor reproduce.
