I've posted this in weaning but thought it might get more traffic here, my 10 month old dd took to weaning brilliantly and will now eat anything and has a huge appetite, the only problem is with finger foods, I think I was maybe overly cautious in the beginning but she hasn't grasped this side of it so well, there's no problem getting food in to her mouth and her pincer grip is great just if I give her a bigger piece of food like a finger of toast or a rice cake etc she just puts the whole thing in then it ends up getting stuck in her throat cue me smacking her on the back! So currently she had toast but broken in to small pieces, just wondering is this a problem or has anyone else had the same? She has no teeth either if that's relevant?
