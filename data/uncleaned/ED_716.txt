New in recoveryHi, i dont consider myself underweight, but i recognize i have an ED, anorexia nervosa. I feel like i have to recover at this point before its too late, im starting to feel the effects on my body and health. I need help and support, cause no one here (family) seems to understand me. My biggest fear is to gain weight again, will i gain weight again?, thats my biggest fear, cause everything started cause i was overweight. My mom and dad want me to eat everything at once, but i dont want to, i want to eat everything but healthy i need help, is my weight so bad? (cause i dont consider that)
