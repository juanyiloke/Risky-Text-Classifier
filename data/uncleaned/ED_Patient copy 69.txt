i've lost myself againI should start off by saying that i used to binge eat for a while then started to binge and purge. After that i started to stop eating and binge when the cravings got too bad every few days. Ive been to therapy for 2 years and it really hasnt helped. I also cut myself very frequently. Now ive just started college and i find myself binge eating all the time. Im upset bc ive gained weight but also because im afraid to tell anyone. I feel like all i think about is food now. my daily thoughts are plagued with this need to eat everything. I share an apartment with 3 girls and i eat their food to the point where theyve gotten upset. i am fat but people say i am average. Please help, i dont know what to do. im sorry..
