ÊHow to talk to your family about suicideI rarely talk to my family about my mental health. Hell, I rarely talk to them at all. It's been weeks since I heard any of their voices. I really only ever talk to my mom and dad. Our conversations are almost always superficial. It seems impossible to talk about real things in my family.ÊThis, the fact that I have no friends, and my lack of any mental health treatment means this forum is basically the only place for me to vent. I can't do this on my own anymore.ÊI don't know what to say to them. While they offer support they never have anything substantive to say or give. I don't know how to bring up suicide around them in any way that would be productive. Most likely it would just make them worry and not lead to me getting any help at all.
