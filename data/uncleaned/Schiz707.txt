 What is this? Label me. Please.Ok. So instead of me labeling myself, I want others to. I will say what issues I have and let you say your opinion.I want your honest opinion. I have a psych appointment in a few days. I just want your opinion and why. I will discuss this with my psych. No worries.-I am always paranoid. I am always paranoid that there are tiny cameras in my room, and I've been like that since 10 or so. -I'm paranoid that someone is watching me-I do admittedly have a high self confidence/grandeur , ONLY when I'm alone. I will talk to myself pretending that rich and a celebrity or something I turned out to be successful in some way (when I cook, I act like I'm on a food network show). Its all pretend I know. But I physically talk to myself only when I'm alone-Ive always been paranoid that my dad and mom go on my computer or something and saw my stuff or they put a key logger on my computer (I have nothing bad to hide, just this type of personal stuff) -I talk to myself. I like me more than others, and I make sense to me-I'm paranoid everyone is talking about me. I ask people if they said anything about me all the time and paranoid about other people
