I don't know what to do...I have been struggling with an eating disorder for several years, trying at points to recover on my own (and for the most part failing) The thing is... I'm happy now. I eventually told my grandma that about this and she said she was going to find me a therapist, but nothing ever came of it and I think she assumed I stopped. Then one day something changed and it just felt like everything kind of snapped back into place. I feel happy, I have fun, I have energy, I got a job and I have a great social life, I even stopped harming myself which is something I struggled with for years, the only thing I haven't managed to fix is my eating disorder. It's not that I think I'm fat or ugly or anything... I actually think I'm really pretty, and I know I'm skinny! I'm very confident in who I am and what I look like.... It's just gotten so bad I don't know what to do. Everything else is so great, except my relationship with food and weight. I can't tell my family again only for them to do nothing, or hate me for causing them so many problems.. It's not that I've not thought about it.. I just can't. I'm terrified of them ever finding out and what they'd think of me if they knew what I do. I WANT to beat this, desperately, I just don't know how... I know the right option would be to seek help, but I don't know if can manage, and I've tried so hard on my own....
