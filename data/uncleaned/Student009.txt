 MSc GIS in Birkbeck?by niamhc119Hey so im an irish student in my final year of my undergraduate geology degree in dublin. I want to do a masters in geographical information science and applied to Leeds, Kingston and Birkbeck. Birkbeck gave me a conditional offer, but i wanted to know if anyone has any experience with this masters in Birkbeck that could tell me what its like? or what is the university like in general?I would also like to know what the general age range of students in this course/university is, as I would be moving to London completely by myself and would like to get to know people around my age. I will be just 23 by the time the course begins. Is there much of a social atmosphere?
