Over Analyzing   yewotc23 , 25 Apr 2015Does anyone else ever take what someone has said and over analyze it and take what they have said to mean something else and drive yourself mad with worrying about it ?Appointment for ESA medical dropped through letterbox the other day and I did end up having a call back from one of the customer service managers at the assessment centre trying to allay some fears and told me alot of what I have read on the internet is just scaremongering and people who have had a bad experience and want to give ATOS or whoever is doing medicals now a bad name. He was very nice to be fair. Gave me his direct line incase I have any more worries or concerns or even if I want to find out where my claim is up to.But what I am driving myself mad with and have actually been crying about is when I spoke to GP about medical and maybe a letter to advise I couldn't go (social anxiety) he has said that its not him being unsympathetic but he thinks actually going would be better as it will show the assessor my anxiety more than a home visit where I would be relaxedI have however took it hopefully the wrong way and got myself in an extremely anxious worked up worried state thinking that GP basically just wants me to go because he thinks I am lazy and should be back at work. Not great feelings to have when I need a.new fit note next week I don't know whether to mention that I have been over analyzing what he said and what I have made out in my head that he meant or whether it will just make me look an idiot
