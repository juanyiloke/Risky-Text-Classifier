health anxiety, or am i really dying!!! Ê13    Soooo iv been suffering from health anxiety for over a year, first started when i had a swollen lymphnode in my groin i was convinced it was cancer, then i had bowel problems and was convinced i had bowel cancer! I was constantly at the docs last year and also a&e as i had a bad anxiety attack in work and thought i was going to die so my boss phoned an ambulance! It took over my life i was so scared of going to bed everynight and not waking up, i taught my daughter how to ring for help on my mobile incase anything happened to me and always left the key in the front door so she could open it incase she needed to get out or paramedics needed to come in (sounds crazy but its not fun to go through), constantly overthinking, tired, intrusive thoughts and i became really depressed so my doctors prescribed sertraline! It took me a while to take these as i was scared of the side effects but i then decided that i couldnt possibly feel any worse so i started to take them and after about 10 weeks i noticed that i wasnt googling every symptom, or feeling around for lumps! But then 4 weeks   my anxiety came back i had pains in my chest and thought i was either going to have a heartattack, stroke or breast cancer, back to docs and she put me on a higher dose of sertraline! The instrusive thoughts are under control but iv been getting really bad headaches all the time, feel like my head is stuck in a vice, have pins and needles in my head, im dizzy, heart palps and im thinking could this be a brain tumour as surely my head couldnt be this sore all the time for no reason, my family think im a hypochondriac so iv stopped telling them and my doctor how i feel! My heads a prison and im struggling to deal with it on my own.....
