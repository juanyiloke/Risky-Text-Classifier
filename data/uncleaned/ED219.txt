ÊThe road to recovery is not far awayHey guys,After a LOT of convincing, my OH has gotten me to ring my doctor for help with my anorexia. I've suffered with it for over 5 years now and only recently was able to admit I had a problem.ÊI'm a little nervous that I'll be judged by my doctor but my OH is making sure I call them no matter what. I've been meaning to for a while but always managed to talk myself out of it.ÊSo, tomorrow, first thing in the morning, I'm getting right on that phone and asking for the help I need! I know it'll probably take quite a long time to fully start my road to recovery, but this is the first step and I'm so excited about this. I'm finally taking control and I'm gonna kick anorexia's butt!!~Alex
