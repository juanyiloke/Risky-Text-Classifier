Why forgiveness is so important.It's important to forgive yourself for anything you've done in your life because you have to accept that making mistakes is natural and unavoidable. You can take steps to reducing the number of mistakes you make, but it is impossible to live your life with the expectation that you won't make any mistakes.If you've made mistakes in the past, think about them now and instead of regretting them, realise and understand the important information from the experience, and you can use that information to avoid making that mistake again. When you make a mistake, it can hurt emotionally and physically, so thinking about mistakes when they hurt less can give you clearer guidance to avoid making them again.You're going to be okay if you remember that mistakes aren't something to be ashamed of. Just breathe in, learn from them and feel proud of using that knowledge to become a better person.
