Deadline... Tick TockMy lease ends August. I have a potential roommate with three pets. He's my ex whose friendship we're both trying to work on. At first I was set on living in Denver. Now it's wherever in the whole state of California or wherever more potential roommates are. We have a mutual friend who's waiting to hear back where her work is based. I feel and know I am dependent for waiting on her. But there's nothing in sight. My family won't help me. I'm also currently living with roommates who are toxic; I say toxic because they don't empathize with my avoidant behavior and social anxiety thus either go into passive aggression or unnecessary confrontations. They're trying to even with me dealing with my own sh*t and it's getting to me. I want out, but then what? Where? I have two months left and I don't know where I'm going. Job search and home search both drain me, and I'm already easily drained to even cook or socialize. This makes me dependent and guilty. While I don't really hate asking for help, and I understand the value of it, I am still not getting the help I need. It's a ping-pong between letting go/having faith and sharp panicky alarms. Advice? Thoughts? Thank you...
