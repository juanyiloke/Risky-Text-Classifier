Caring for new type 2 diabeticMy husband has been told he is Type 2 diabetic and has been given a diet sheet.  He's one of those people who won't discuss their health and will never allow me to attend doctor's visits with him - even when he went into hospital for knee surgery he insisted I drop him at the door and he didn't want to see me until I collected him to take him home.So I am ignorant about this new diet.  He will not hear of me contacting the clinic for advice, saying its all in the leaflet.  But it isn't!On the one hand, I read about the 'healthy plate' consisting of half a plate of carbs and the rest made up from protein and green leafy vegetables.  On the other hand is the view that carbs are to be minimised and vegetables (except roots) protein and some fats should be maximised.Which is correct?
