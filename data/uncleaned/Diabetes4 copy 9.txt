Back in time for dinnerHas anyone else been following this series on BBC?  One British family embark on an extraordinary time-travelling adventure to discover how a post-war revolution in the food we eat has transformed the way we live.  Each decade their home is transformed back to the way it would have been and in each episode they portray each year of the 10 years encapsulated in 1 day in the family's life.It's very interesting and illustrates how our diets in Britain have changed since the 1950s onwards.  All 5 episodes are still available on iPlayerhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05nc5tv/episodes/playerIt does bear out what I have been whinging on about, i.e. that our diet is actually getting considerably less healthy.  Another point it makes is that back up to the end of the 60s and possibly 70s families ate together and the family in the experiment are all saying they preferred it as it made the family more cohesive.The mother drives me nuts, but the dad and the 3 kids are brilliant!
