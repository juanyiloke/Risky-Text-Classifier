I have been in therapy for the past year and a half for PTSD from childhood sexual abuse. I have had some EMDR sessions with my psychologist and I thought they helped, but my PTSD seems to be getting worse as I have flashbacks on a daily basis and can't seem to suppress the horrible visions of what was done to me. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, those visions and thoughts pop into my mind and I am having a hard time functioning at work and I feel my marriage is being impacted negatively. I just need to know that it is possible to recover from this and I won't always have PTSD and these thoughts and visions always popping into my head.
