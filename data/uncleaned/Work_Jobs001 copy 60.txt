Travelling while on Sick Leave________________________________________So I broke my ankle two weeks ago and have been unable to work since as I am on crutches. It was suggested I could return to work, but I work with children so that is not feasible.Over a year prior to my sick leave, I have booked a volunteering trip abroad which will be coming up while I am still on certified sick leave. My GP has said I can travel, but am not able to work while on crutches. For the trip, I will be able to be in a wheelchair and have someone to push me, so it should not interfere with healing etc.Can I travel despite sill being on sick leave? And do I need to inform anyone?Thanks
