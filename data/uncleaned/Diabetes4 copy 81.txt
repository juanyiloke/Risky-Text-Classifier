StatinsWas that Malcolm Kendrick on BBC1 News this morning talking about statins and their side effects?  Wonderful to hear there is a group of doctors who are now brave enough to query the efficacy of statins, whilst telling people quite plainly the side effects, i.e. the effects those of you who were prescribed, and took statins, (muscle problems, stomach problems and memory problems) and then decided that the side effects were unacceptable.  They went into statistical data, and they have decided that the benefits are miniscule.  Not sure about all the stats but I'm sure someone will come along with a better interpretation of what was said.  Pleased to hear this.  At my last meeting with DSN the Doctor had asked her to discuss statins with me with a total chol of 5.3 (breakdown not done).  I now feel I am armed with the opinions of some eminent doctors who are suggesting people take a long hard look before taking statins.  BTW there was also a bit about 'board' (not sure what board) members and pharmaceutical companies!!.  I certainly won't take them - with osteoarthritis I would be mad to do so.
