Hello everyone, I started my maternity leave October 24th. My son was born 2 weeks late on the 26th November. I am a primary school teacher and will be returning to work this September. I have asked to return part time but our head teacher is not very open to part time or job shares. I will be seeing her next week about her decision. I'm trying to be positive! Praying she will let me return part time. I just feel such sadness at the thought of returning but I know I am very lucky as some women have to return after a shorter time than myself. My feelings are not helped though by my sister as she has my 2 year old nephew and hasn't worked at all over the past 2 years and there is no plan for her to look for work. She has been supported by her boyfriend for the past year. This just makes me feel like a bad mum that I'm going back to work. The plan is for my mum to have my son and I appreciate this so much but yet feel quite a burden on her! My husband and I have always worked so hard to pay everything and therefore have no debts, finance ect. I know this is a positive thing and I know that the reality is that two incomes are better than one and I wouldn't expect my husband to solely support us. I just don't want this to be at the cost of my son and I relationship. I don't want him to resent/forget me. Any help trying to pick my chin up from the floor would be much appreciated! Thank you.xxx
