Hi all,I work PT & am generally home weekends as my husband tends to work weekends (shifts). We have a 18 month old son.I find the weekends quite isolating& get a bit stuck what to do. Most of my days off I organise play dates / go out to soft play etc but on the weekends alot of places geared towards my son locally are closed & my friends (I assume) are having family time with their partner & kids.I find the days long & a bit stuck what to do. So today we are about to go for a walk to the bakers & later on I have some shopping to collect from town. Tom morning we will go swimming. But it's just me & LO, & as much as I love it being us 2, two whole days seem such a long time! I struggle with activities at home & find the TV is on more than it should be. He is not walking so trying to help him practice at home. When he does we could go for little walks to the park. Stuff we currently do is colouring, Lego, playing in the garden, & few other little things. Everything has a shelf life of about 10 mins.ÊI do (try) & keep on top of the housework too so I am not lazy or anything. I just a bit stuck what to do on my own with a toddler & no adult company.ÊWhat's triggered my post as I looked at the clock & realised it's 10am, & a little daunted & isolating that I have 2 days of this ahead. Again.Ê
