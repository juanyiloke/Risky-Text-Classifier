My story is a bit complicated. I'm 24. When I was 16 I was put into a hospital (voluntarily) for reckless behavior. The staff was very abusive. I won't go into detail but I was taunted everyday and went through a series of panic attacks. When I got out, I was sick and my anxiety was much worse. I was afraid to speak to anyone at all. to this day it haunts me and I'm being treated for bipolar and PTSD. My problem is I've lost all trust in psychiatrists and I always think they're out to get me. I also had a bad experience with a past psychiatrist for 3 years. I want help for an addiction I have but I'm terrified to speak up. Even though I'm not a minor anymore, I still think (sometimes) I'm still there and they can still hurt me. I want help but I'm so afraid that I panic. My faith is strong so I pray that I can move on someday. What should I do? I would more than appreciate any advice, suggestions or support. Thank you so much for listening.
