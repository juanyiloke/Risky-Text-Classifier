i have fallen deeply in love with a man, the first real true love of my whole life... i am 48. i have had ptsd since the age of 21. have multiple sexual traumas in my past. suddenly i discover my bf is addicted to porn. the 2 words i fear most in this world are rape, and porn. i do not wish to leave this man, we want to heal together. how do i cope with this most intense daily trigger of my life? i recently 'coped' with cutting. do not want to continue. also have the strong urge to injure my head in several manners. i am in both individual and group therapy already. will now go out and find a group for spouses of sex addicts. but until i can find that, i am looking for some online support. anything encouraging will be welcome. thanks.
