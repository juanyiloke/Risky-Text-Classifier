Januvia Sitagliptine and Gout?I was wondering if anyone here had experience of developing gout after taking Januvia.I am also taking metformin and medication for blood pressure. But have been on these two meds for a few years now with no serious problems. It was last Thursday that I started taking the Januvia as well. This morning I woke up with a pain in my right foot which has got worse over time and means I am limping around.So I checked the information leaflet which does not say this can be a side effect. On the internet there are a few articles about people who say they have gout but this was a result of the type 2 diabetes & diet. Like I say, I follow a good sensible diet now and have been getting regular exercise - so the only change for me has been the Januvia.I have not taken my dose this morning as I cant go on taking it unless I can be 100% sure this is not the cause of this trouble. I just would like to know if anyone here has had a similar experience.
