Reversal of diabetiesHi everyone,I was diagnosed with type 2 at the end of April 2014, which was a relief as I had been feeling unwell for a while.My HbA1c was 7.4, 6.7 and now 6.3. I am only diet controlled and as I have recently taken early retirement with my husband I am enjoying cooking fresh food from scratch. we are also getting more exercise now we have the time.I know what I have been doing is working, but I have times when it's all to confusing. I read a book about reversal of diabetics, but different nurses seem to have different ideas. Has anyone managed to reverse their diabetes?
