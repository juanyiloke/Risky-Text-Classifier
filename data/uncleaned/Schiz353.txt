I've been trying my best to be 'normal'. Why I am striving in college and getting extremely good grades, I feel like that is not enough. I've been suffering lately very intense from negative symptoms. I have friends but when I'm around them I feel like I am trapped behind a plate of glass. Being a college age student, it seems like all of the people I know spend their time hanging out late at night usually at parties drinking. I can't do either of these things because of my medication. It's incredibly hard for me to meet new people, because I'm suspicious of them. Lately I've spent the past weeks on my own besides my older brother and family. I picked up bike riding which has helped my mood a bit. I'm hoping that someone can give some advice to be more outgoing. I'm worried if I spend more time alone, my delusions and hallucinations will get the best of me. Thank you for reading!
