How to help myself?by hiddenhurt » Mon Mar 09, 2015 2:49 pmHas anyone got advice for me? I want to be the happy person I used to be but I simply don't know where to start?. I have to wait months before counselling so I am on my own dealing with PTSD. I am losing everyone, I can be fine for months until I'm triggered and then anger comes out like venom, leading to me shutting people out so they can't harm me. My triggers seem to be if I feel shame, unworthy, and/or attacked in any form. It stems back to an abusive relationship where I was emotionally and physically abused. I was locked in a cupboard so I hate feeling trapped or letting anyone close to me. I dissociated at times of abuse and I had to beg my mum to save my life, which creates an unwanted feeling that he the ex or someone else, will someday finish me off. I would love to be the person I once was because I am lonely and scared. I don't know how to stop these triggers, I can't keep hurting people because I have a big heart and it's not the person I want to be.
