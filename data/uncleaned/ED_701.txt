This is becoming hellI only started restricting a week ago and I can't stand this. I'm tired of feeling hungry all the time and all I do is crave food. I can't let myself eat it because I think it'll make me a bad person. I started this now, it's too late to stop. I feel like I'm so stupid because people live with eating disorders for years but I can't even survive a week of eating less. I don't even think I have an actual eating disorder because I feel like if I did I wouldn't have such a strong desire to eat. All I want to do is go and eat something but I can't let myself after coming this far. When I see how much weight I lost I just feel so good, and I want that more. But really I haven't come far at all, it has only been a matter of days. I think forward into the future and I seriously can't see myself doing this everyday for much longer. A person with an eating disorder would be the opposite, they wouldn't be able to imagine not doing this for the rest of their life. So what exactly is wrong with me?? I'm going to talk to my counselor about this tomorrow but I'm going to feel so dumb because it isn't a real eating disorder, I feel like a fake or something.
