ZoloftI'm on the generic of Zoloft and lately since I've been on it I've seen a noticeable increase in my disregard for school work and others. I'm on Vyvanse for my ADD and before I go home after school I have great enthusiasm to work on school projects, homework, and such. When I get home my medicine wares off and I lose interest in doing my work. My Zoloft takes control and I'm relaxed and disregard my work until a day or the morning before it's due, and usually I do it after it is due. How do I handle this? and how do I regain my regard for others?
