Hopelessly DepressedI’ve been depressed for so long, I’m not sure what happy looks like or if its even at all attainable. It doesn’t feel like its ever going to get any better. On top of that, I’ve had severe anxiety. I’m not sure why – I just feel anxious all the time. I’m not sleeping much. I feel a mess. My Dr.’s are not helpful. I do use alternative therapies and meds…nothing seems to help. I don’t know what to do or how much more of it I can take. Is there any help out there? Will I be able to get through this? I feel like killing myself. Help.
