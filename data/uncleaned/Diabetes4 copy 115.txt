National Diabetes Audithttp://www.hscic.gov.uk/ndaI've only just heard about this because I had read on another forum that somebody had been registered as diabetic and I wondered if everybody was. My GP has never mentioned anything to me. Maybe I just lead a very quiet life and nobody tells me anything. LOLOLOne of the benefits is supposed to be and I quote "identify and share best practice". How many people on this forum do you think will get the chance to explain their best practice, especially on the carb front. If you are registered, do you have the chance to give any feedback. It's all very well if the GP records all these people with excellent BG control, but useless if they don't realise that people do more than "keep taking the tablets."
