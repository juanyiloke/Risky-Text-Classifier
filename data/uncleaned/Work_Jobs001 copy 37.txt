leaving work due to anxiety________________________________________I cant go back to where I work because of anxiety. I work as a waitress. I've had sexual harassment from a customer and recently my boss. I cant face going in again. If I don't go back I won't be entitled to any benefits for quitting. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to report the harassment for many reasons. I'm looking for work but it could mean weeks/months without money which I can't afford either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
