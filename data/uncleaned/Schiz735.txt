Ênegative symptoomsHi, I have been taking olanzapine (10 mg) for last few months and I don't know if it worked or not.... because, every now and then I will have these episodes where I think everyone is conspiring against me or talking about me. when I am not having episodes, I have these negative symptoms like lack of motivation, hard time expressing my feelings, hard time talking to even my family members. I am constantly on the edge and restless and I have isolated myself from every social contact because I have also developed social anxiety; I am afraid people will judge me or will misunderstand me. I feel like I have lost my freedom, I am always scared of myself and the world.So, my question is, even though I am taking my medication as prescribed my doctor, I am not feeling that much better... what should I do... how can I ignore above symptoms... how can I cope with above symptoms... I wanna start college again and I am afraid that these symptoms will become a problem...what can I do to get better...please share your views.
