ÊBrother died by suicide.I'm not sure which forum I belong to. I am seeing a psychiatrist, I'm on meds (too much I think but not enough sometimes). I have PTSD, anxiety, clinical depression and personality disorder.ÊSince my brother died by suicide two years ago, I have been getting nightmares, I'm extremely sad and wish I was dead also, but I won't kill myself because I know how much it hurts to lose a loved one by suicide since I'm the only live sibling, I feel this huge responsibility to take care of my parents. My dad is dying of liver disease (caused by alcoholism). Don't get me wrong, I don't drink alcohol because it makes me sick. My anxiety is so bad that my heart hurts.ÊHow do I cope with this pain. I cry everyday. I just want to be with my brother. Life is so difficult.
