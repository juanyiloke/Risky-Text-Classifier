asthma flare continous________________________________________hi - i was hoping for some advice, my asthma was very well controlled, i was using symbicort twice a day and never used my blue inhaler even with exercise, however i went on holiday and smoked quite alot for onlyabout 5 days - have not smoked since. However after 5 days my asthma got worse, my inhalers didnt make much difference and I have a constant tight chest, I was on 3 courses of pred however this made little difference, I am now on seratide 500 and speriver (sp?) this has been going on for two months and still see little improvement - I am worried my asthma will never return back to normal - anyone else experience anything similar when they started smoking? Am getting worried about it now
