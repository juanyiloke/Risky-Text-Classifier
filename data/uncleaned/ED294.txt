ÊViolence towards food?I haven't been diagnosed with anything specific, just generalized "Sucks at eating like a personness". Recently a new and ever-so-lovely thing has been happening.ÊOccasionally I get these seriously violent urges towards the food itself, I'm not exactly sure why it happens, or why it's so intense. On the really bad days I end up mutilating it to the point where it might as well not even be food anymore. On not horrible days it just goes in the trash in a wave of anger.ÊDoes anyone else here experience this? It really makes me feel like I'm losing it.
