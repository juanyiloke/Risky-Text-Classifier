ÊHow to talk about food in therapy?I'd like to ask you for advice. I have a problem with binge eating which started after a period of controlled eating and after I've been for some time in therapy. At first my therapist said we wouldn't talk much about eating. However, at the moment she believes we should work through this issue (and she presses me). So far there were no issues for me in therapy that I could not talk about. Sometimes it was hard but I finally managed that.ÊHowever, when I imagine talking about food, I'm terrified. I'm so much ashamed that it is impossible for me at the moment. She asks me what I eat and how much I eat while binging. I think she's still trying to establish why I'm doing that. I'm curious whether there are people who feel similar about this topic. Do you have any advice for me how I could handle it? I'm sure I need to prepare (what I'm going to say), but it's hard to even think of that.Moreover, I know that I would feel more confident and could handle this topic more easily if I lost my weight. So I decided that I need to control myself again - in this way I'll feel it's "beyond me", as I'm not binging anymore. Though, I know doesn't make any sense and controlling myself again will only mean trying not to admit what my problem is.Do you have any ideas how I can handle this topic in therapy? What could help?
