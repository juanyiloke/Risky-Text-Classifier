A base in the Middle EastThis week our local council announced that it was “rationalising” (i.e. closing) most of the council run day centres and also making all the gardeners in our local park redundant, all as part of cut backs, but we can afford to set up a naval base in the Middle East!! Do we have our priorities right??
