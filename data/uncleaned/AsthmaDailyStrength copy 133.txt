....that I'm not in the middle of an asthma flare, even though my PFT improved by 25% afterXopenex. She thinks everything going on is psych in nature and wants to talk to my pdoc. I just saw my pdoc yesterday and she's not willing to change my meds any. Maybe aftertalking to my pulmo she will change her mind. I'm just tired of having everything be psych just because I have a psych history. I'm tired of the attitude that just because I have a psych history, nothing else can be wrong with me, and then the attitude from psych that she's unwilling to do what works best for me if it's outside her comfort zone. I may just have to go outside the public mental health system to get quality care. I just can't afford going more than once a month and even that is going to hurt in the summertime when temps hit triple digits and my electric bill hits $130-150 a month. I get less than $1,100 a month and coming up with that kind of electric bill hurts. Then add the copay for a psychiatrist and I'm going to be hurting financially. I'm just about ready to give up. Annie
