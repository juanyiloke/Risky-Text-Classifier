Asthma triggersin Retail Work. Hi all, this is my 1st post with the forum and I was wondering how people work with triggers in retail. I work in retail and since Christmas I have struggled with work and home life. My tolerance to any fragrances has hit rock bottom and since the end of January I have off work as I cannot control my asthma when close to washing powders, air fresheners, candles or even customers wearing perfume and aftershave. Has anybody had the same problem and how did you overcome it? My gp has organised an appointment to see a consultant followed by an appointment at a respiratory clinic but that is in April '15. If anybody has any tips or best practices that they can share I would greatly appreciate the help.Thank you.
