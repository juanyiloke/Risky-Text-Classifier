I have been diagnosed with PTSD/Bipolar since December of 2012. My history goes all way back to the age of five. My parents were both physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive, and to make matters worse in October of 2012 I was robbed at gun point. I am STRUGGLING real hard to deal with this PTSD/Bipolar issue, I don't feel rested at all when I wake up, my eyes are red with a burning sensation. I have seen two psychiatrists and nothing seems to help from the consultations to EMDR therapy with my counselor. I have tried numerous medications prescribed from my doctors and nothing has helped, the medicine would turn me into a zombie. In addition, after I was robbed I had a mental break psychologically, I was rushed to a Behavioral Mental Institution were I was there for about five days. I recently did a sleep study regarding my sleeping problem and all they want to do for me is remove my tonsils, they feel my tonsils are interfering with my sleep. I am also taking quite a bit of holistic herbs, vitamins, acupuncture and nothing helps with my sleep. I am going next week to see a chiropractor and see what can be done for me. Can someone please give me some insight that might compare to me?
