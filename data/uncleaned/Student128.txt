University Transfer Queryby AlexGanzI am currently first year studying software engineering BEng at Westminster University (ranked 99 / 115). I have been offered a place to switch to Goldsmiths University (ranked 51 / 115) for second year to study Computer Science Bsc. There are a few factors to take into account: a) Do employers really care which university you're coming from (if it's not top 10).b) I'm well on my way to achieving a First Class Honors in Westminster, if I transfer and find it more difficult and end up with a 2:1, is that worth it? So, overall should I take the offer?Thanks for the help!
