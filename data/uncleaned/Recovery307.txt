A bit of good newsWell, I'm not exactly on the home straight by any means, but something very significant has happened in my life over the past couple of months. Anyone who has read my posts will know that I was suffering with a knee injury for nearly a year and a half. Well, I can't quite believe I'm saying this, but I've now been pain-free for over two months and today I ran 5k for the first time in 18 months - completely pain-free. I've seen so many different specialists over the past year and a half so I still don't really know what has fixed the pain. All I know is that I feel like I've got some hope now and I'm very, very grateful.
