Type 2 Diabetes and the drug Victoza  7  Hi everyone, My husband is 61 and was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes three years ago. He is 5'10 and weighs around 260 pounds or just over 18 stones. He takes Metformin just once a day, each morning and visits the diabetes nurse every six months at our local doctors'. He tells me they are happy with him and that everything is okay....However, I am concerned that despite being asked to try and lose weight he doesn't seem to be able to. I have tried to cut down on the quantity of food I serve him at mealtimes and have also tried to offer healthy meals, but he seems us satisfied and will eat other things to satiate his hunger. I don't want to be a nag, (as we are virtually newly weds) and dont want to jeopardise our relationship if I keep on about his food intake, but I think he could be a prime candidate for a heart attack or stroke. He eats twice the amount of anyone I have previously known and seems to get hungry within three hours following a meal. I'm wondering if he has an addiction to food? My husband has next to no exercise, has a stressful job, works mainly long, unsociable hours behind a desk or is stuck behind the wheel of his car travelling around the country.Today on television we heard mention of a drug called Victoza being used with diabetes and that this also has appetite suppressant properties. Has anyone on this forum ever tried this drug and if so, was it successful in helping to cut down on food intake?  Are there any side effects? And, does anyone know if Victoza is available in the UK on the NHS? Many thanks. LadyPink
