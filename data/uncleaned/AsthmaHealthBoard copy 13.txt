Asthma and surgery________________________________________Just making an observation. Sometimes it is really confusing to me about how medical personnel view asthma. My asthma has been under control for a while now. I had surgery 5 weeks ago (female stuff)...sedation, no intubation. They told me no allergy meds until after my afternoon surgery. I went for pre-op today for a totally unrelated ankle procedure I'm having tomorrow afternoon. I'll have the same type of light sedation. This time, they want me to use my daily inhaler and to use my Albuterol 1/2 hour before surgery as a precaution, as well as bringing my Albuterol with me. Same hospital, different instructions. The same thing happened to me a couple years ago for other joint surgeries. It seems that they really don't follow a good standard protocol. I carry my Epi-pen and Albuterol everywhere so I feel I'm taking care of my needs here, but I worry about those who don't understand their asthma well.
