mass on my left lungLast week I had horrible pain in my mid back around my ribs. I waited two days before I couldnt take it anymore. I had an xray done and was told I had a large mass on my left lung. the e.r. doc said it could be pneumonia well the mass part freaked me out I wanted to just leave and see my dr. So he prescribed me zpack. The next day I seen my dr and the xray it is a large very round mass that looks like it goes past my lung and pushes against my diaphragm. Dr suggest I take my zpack and get another xray in two weeks. Well like most of us I started looking on the Internet for exactly wha5 I seen and felt the only things I can find are mass = cancer. My meds are now done and I can breathe with no pain I feel fantastic. Has anyone experienced anything like this before? I am a mess wondering whats wrong with me this 2 week wait for the next xray is going to kill me. I just turned 39 I smoked for 20 years quit a year ago. I run 3-4 miles about 3 days a week with any breathing problems. Just confused
