raised random blood glucose but pass OGTT   For several years I have been having raised blood glucose after eating e.g a sandwich can cause a spike up to 12mmol/l and may last a couple of hours. Other days I seem to get away with it.I know it is a bit unusual but the reason I have been able to take these measurements and identify which days the sandwich was a bad idea is because but I seem to be able to feel it. i.e racing heart, clumsy, out of control, tired etc., even at relatively reasonable values like 7 to 9 mmmol/l.The Dr. checked that I wasn't gluten intolerant because my biggest problems are after bread and pizza and agreed that some of his random measurements were a bit high.BUT my OGTT was normal.My meter is calibrated and has agreed with Dr. measured values and also agrees with the way I feel at the time.An old way of defining diabetes was if a person had several random readings greater than 11.1 mmmol/l wich makes me definately diabetic but the modern OGTT says I am perfectly normal.Anyone else experienced this?
