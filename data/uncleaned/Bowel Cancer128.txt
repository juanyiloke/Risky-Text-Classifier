Home again!Just popped in to say I came home for the second time last night, My lung had filled up with fluid from the operation so had to have a drain put in for a few days, hoping now all ok and can start to get some energy back, this operation seems harder to get over than the bowel operation or maybe it is me just having a short memory LOLHope everyone is doing ok and hope to get back to the forum and start reading messages in a few daysLoveNicola7 weeks and still illJust popping in to say hello, I am still struggling from the lung operation 7 weeks agoI came home and went back in with fluid on the lung this was drained and sent home again and started to make a recovery and last week my GP sent me back as an emergency for suspected clot, well another 4 days in hospital and they still cannot tell and all the dr tells me is I am a complicated person LOLWell one step forward and 10 back and now being treated for a clot I don't no if I have but been told if they don't treat me it is life threateningI am so weak and in so much main, just curl up sometimes and hope I can fight thisNicola
