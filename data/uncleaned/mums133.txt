My toddler (will be 3 in August) has taken to saying "Don't touch me" any time DH or I try to get her to do something she doesn't want to do. She says it when I change her diaper, when we pick her up because she won't go where we want her to go, that kind of thing.Thing is, this is what we want her to do if someone did try to touch her in an inappropriate way. But when she does it with us, it's embarrassing, especially in public, and especially for DH. Any hints on how to get her to stop doing this with us?
