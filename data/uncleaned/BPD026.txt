Death & my Griefby Dooobie » Sun Jun 07, 2015 7:51 pmMy partner's friend died last night in hospital as he had a tumor and the chemotherapy caused him to bleed out. I can't stop thinking about him and my partner and me have both been really upset but he never lets me comfort him and says he's never been a huggy person. I'm not either and would prefer to grieve alone but I feel so cut off from him as he's the only person I do want to hug and kiss and it's making me very lonely and angry at him. Grief is an unusual and deep hurting. I don't know if I'm not envious of his friend that he is gone and at peace and partly crying for myself- I am impatiently wondering when my turn will finally come and preferably before my parents die to save me from that. I'm homesick for Heaven.....I know how selfish that sounds and like I'm making it about myself when it should not be at all about me today but there's nowhere and no one I can vent these thoughts and feelings to other than on here. I've been with my boyfriend 8 years and I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be alone and lonely than with someone who doesn't 'do' sympathy unless it's for himself. Whenever I am crying, he never comforts me or says anything encouraging- he says nothing at all and doesn't even acknowledge that I'm upset at all. The only time he tries to be affectionate is in bed which is just sex and because of my medication and being a Christian, I am reluctant, numb and dis interested, yet I still do things for him because he feels rejected if I don't. Anyway, I'm sorry to moan on and on (and on) .
