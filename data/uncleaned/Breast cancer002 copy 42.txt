Triple negative¥	Hi all how you doing¥	I have my last chemo this Friday fingers crossed no delays... When I initially saw the oncologist he mentioned that I was borderline on triple negative and if I tested positive to the braca1 gene then I may be able to get onto a trial for triple negative breast cancer I have been referred to the genetics team and I go and see them on 11th may I was wondering if any of you who are triple negative are participating in any trials at present as I'm just gathering info so when I see my oncologist I can ask him more questions xx
