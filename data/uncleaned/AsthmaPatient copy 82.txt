Been taking Montelukast for only a week Been taking the medication for only a week and yes my asthma is already improving and i have already noticed how much less i am taking my inhalers. BUT the side effects, how long do they last??? i am already having trouble staying asleep, dry mouth and feeling really sluggish. With the lack of sleep i am more irritable and thats not fair on my hubby or the kids.I think this medication could really change my life if only i can see through the side effects. call me a wimp but i am already thinking of giving up.take care everyone
