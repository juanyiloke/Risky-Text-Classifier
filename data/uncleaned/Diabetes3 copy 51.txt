Freestyle Libre and some questionsFinally got my email to say I can buy one next week.. So now got to decide do if I want to go ahead with investing in one.I use the accu-chec Combi but since returning to work a year ago, my control even though remains pretty good and my consultant remains very pleased with it. It isn't has good as it was or I feel could be. Purely because at work the dynamics of the day, means that it's hasn't been possible to achieve enough testing to adjust basal or bolus ratio's....I know it's limitations as in it's a flash reader and not a gcm, so no alarms for low/highs and you got to flash it to get a reading to what has happened ect.So some questions,How good is the trend information for adjusting basal rates?What is the accuracy between the meter and sensor, so at meal times you can use it to basically do a guessamate insulin delivery!For those that use the accu-chec combi meter for insulin delivery, have you had any issues with getting your gp to supply both the Avia test strip and what ever the Libre uses..The starter kit, does that come with a small supply of test strips to get you going... And lastly any tips and tricks to get the best out of the sensor, or perhaps down falls there might be.It is likely that I will have to undergo an assessment in work, concerning wearing it, but thankfully due to a new unit head, deputy matron and matron, I now have very good support and understanding, as the deputies sister is a fellow pumper...
