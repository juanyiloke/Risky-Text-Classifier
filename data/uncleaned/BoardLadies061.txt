The Cost of ContraceptionSo I was at the doctor just there, getting my routine injection. I didn't have my medical card because it's not my GP (who I'd usually use) as I'm in college. What left me dumbfounded (other than the fact the doctor was a prick but that's another story) was the price! Û40 for literally 3 minutes of stabbing a needle into my rear end. In fact, would have been half a minute if he didn't spend so long sneering at me and that was with a student discount. So I had a look at the price list on the way out. It's usually fifty euro and that's not the most expensive thing. The implant is Û140 to get in and Û100 to get out. A Cervical Check is Û100! That's ridiculous prices! Is this the same across all doctors or is this one just taking the mick? How can women afford routine contraception at such prices? I use a medical card and I'm very grateful for it at the best of times but now I'm very thankful for it...
