Men who agree with corporal punishmentI have posted on this issue previously in other forums and tend to get a very biased one sided argument mostly from women! I would wonder do men vary much in their opinion of corporal punishment and it's effectiveness as a type of discipline today. Just reading a previous thread on this forum on aggressive behaviour in teens and it seems there's at least some men out there who feel corporal punishment is useful in dealing with it. So lads are we for or against smacking? Is it acceptable? Do we need a return to the days of the belt and the wooden spoon?
