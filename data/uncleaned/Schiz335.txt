I just read a book that everyone needs to read! I just read Anatomy of an Epidemic by Robert Whitaker. I came hone from the library and art museum at noon and I just finished a little after seven. I even stopped for dinner, to take some trash out, and rest. I have to admit that I didn't read two chapters; the ones about the children and how they are unnecessarily being prescribed psychiatric medications. I thought I would get too angry because of children's natural innocence and vulnerability. It is tragic how those so very young are being damaged for life. Some important points of this book are these psychiatric meds have very damaging side effects; including possible death. The rise of the use of these psych meds has lead to a rise in ssi and ssdi. The drug companies hid the side effects and adverse effects from us. Pdocs do get payoffs from the drug companies; especially big name, academic pdocs. The drug companies created a big campaign to convince the public to take the drugs; because they were reluctant. The meds may not stop the symptoms and cause the symptoms to return even if you faithfully take your meds. They can cause other symptoms to emerge. NAMI is in cohoots with the drug companies. There are alternatives to meds and people were recovering and returning to their lives better than before the rise of meds in treatment. There is more in the book. I think that I have been thinking of the similar things in the past two years; but this explained some of my thoughts on this matter. Please go to your local library and check out this book. It is a must for everyone diagnosed with a mental illness or every prescribed psychiatric medications for any reason. Also, it does not advocate for Scientology's point of view or tactics; but, finds it unfortunate that they came on the scene at this time. Please read. You may not agree with what he says; but, read anyway. It will make you think twice before you take that pill again.
