I really hate uni and i think ive left it too late to do anything about it..by elinrjonesim in uni in my hometown but live in halls instead of home, and thats pretty much the only aspect ive enjoyed- the freedom.I dont like my course, im lonely as i dont have any friends on my course or in halls and ive completely lost any motivation, and as a result ive began failing.I have no idea what to do, as even if i could resit this year, i really dont want to but ive wasted so much time and money just for unhappiness and very bad anxiety, so that some days i cant even leave my room until i know there wont be anyone around halls.I really dont know what to do, cant even bring myself to tell anyone, most of all my parents...
