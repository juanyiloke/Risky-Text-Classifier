G'day :)Well...I'm not sure quite what to say. I had a Ct scan one week ago, saw a specialist on Wednesday and go for a biopsy this coming Monday. Boy things are moving fast! I have been told that my CT scan is 'highly suspicious' for lung cancer. A mass that is showing as encrouching on an airway. To say I'm a tad stunned would be an understatement. I live in Canada, in Ontario. I'm 58, happily married, have kids, grandkids and even one great grandkid   Love animals, all kinds and hubby and I have 4 cats. Just wanted to say hi and admit to being scared. Guess that is pretty normal  So...hi everyone.
