Gentleman's Compendium Of The Visual Arts (AKA Television and Films)I'm not sure if there is a thread devoted to this or not already, but I think that this could be a good place for us to share, discuss and otherwise converse about Television and Films. In a sophisticated and gentlemanly manner only, of course. Firstly, I think that no modern gentleman should go without watching HBO's The Sopranos. One of the truest definitions of brilliance ever to emerge from the small screen. The acting, the writing, the characters, the production values. Absolutely everything about this show is just from the very top drawer and it is for this very reason that it is so lauded and so brilliant. I recently invested in the Blu-Ray box set and it is worth every penny. If you haven't watched this already, watch it. It is a long haul (the episodes are all about 50 minutes long and there are 86 episodes spread over 6 seasons), but it is one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever have. Simply one of the best (if not the best) television shows of all time.Currently, I am watching American Horror Story. I am just about halfway through the first season. Weird does not begin to describe at the start. But gradually the fog lifts and it becomes apparent what is going on and so on. It is not genuinely scary (at least not to me), but it is creepy and weird. I'm enjoying it. And I am just stunned that this show has run for 4 seasons so far. It does not seem like something that American audiences would go for and being so non-mainstream. I'm glad, though. Because it is a show that I'm enjoying and I've got a lot more of it to come.So, gentlemen, what are your opinions, inputs and otherwise observations about television shows and/or films that you enjoy or would like to hear about?
