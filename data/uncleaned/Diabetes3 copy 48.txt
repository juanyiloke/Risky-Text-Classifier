Missing in Action! Please let us know how you are doing :)From time to time we notice that people who used to post here seem to have stopped and it's always a mystery why. Hopefully, it's because things are going well in their lives and they are managing their diabetes well, but sometimes it's because they are finding things difficult and finding it hard to look for the help they need to get back on track. Some people perhaps have never posted, but read the forum regularly - it would be nice to have a little insight into your lives. The more experiences we have to draw on, the better the forum functions as people realise that they are not alone with this and there are other out there who can empathise.  Please let us know how you are doing - good or not so good! No-one is here to judge others if things have slipped, we are here to offer mutual support and get the best we can out of our lives, so drop us a line whatever your situation
