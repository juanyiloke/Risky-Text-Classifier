Screw top bottle opener aimed at the population aged over 65.Hi everyone,First of all I have a confession to make, I am not a pensioner. I am however, a 22 year old Product Design Engineering student at The University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and I'm currently doing my final year. My final year project is redesigning the screw top bottle opener which can be used to open large fizzy drinks bottles, jars etc. The current products around aren't that great so I'm aiming to improve that and make difficult to open jars and bottles something of the past.It was actually my Grandfather that gave me the idea for this product and that's why I chose to aim the product at members of the population over the age of 65. I come to ask you for help as I'm required to do several stages of market research and one of those aspects is a user survey. I would appreciate it immensely if you wouldn't mind taking 10 minutes to fill it in, it's only seven questions and most of them are multiple choice.You can fill in the survey, here. (It won't let me post external links, is there any way around this, perhaps if I approve it with an Administrator?)Thank you all for your help, and if you have any questions feel free to ask them as I'm more than happy to answer them.Ewan.
