Hi All I had written about the strep that was going away and the cough that was going away well it's all back and I feel run down, tired and in pain. They gave me penicillin but last night I took a look and the white spots are back on my throat, and my asthma is raging with a deep cough every night and sore throat. Has anyone had this repeatedly? I'm worried that the penicillin isn't working because I started it Friday and I'm getting worse and it's now Monday. I now have ear pain and itching which in the past was indicative of an ear infection. What should I do? I'm definitely going to finish my antibiotics, but I also have symptoms of an upcoming urinary tract infection now too. It's like this will never end. It's been almost a month now that I've been fighting this thing.
