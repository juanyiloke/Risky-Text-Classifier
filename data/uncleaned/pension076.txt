Doomed , we are all DOOMEDI am getting a bit brassed off with all the doom and gloom that emanates from some of the threads within these forum walls.I know we all have the right to have a rant and express our differing opinions on politics and all that comes with that subject, ie immigration, taxes etc. etc. but c'mon where's all the light hearted banter gone. We see the same old names coming up with long winded posts trying to tell us how right they are and wrong and uneducated and misinformed the rest of us"plebs" are. I know a few of you out there enjoy high brow blah blah blah and perhaps many of us don't wish to see thread after thread discussing lets say immigration...why? because there is sod all we can do about it,these immigrants will arrive whether we want it or not. I think a few of you need to lighten up a bit and start looking on the bright side of life ,if that is possible.I know what a few of you might be thinking on reading my post that if i don't like it then go elsewhere and i think maybe a few other members already have, there are a few names i haven't seen in a while.ÊI enjoy ( believe it or not) coming on here i have made a couple of good friends, all I'm trying to put over is does it have to be so serious 95% of the time or am i completely out of order? or missing something ( there you are left myself wide open)I've not set out to offend so hopefully no one has been offended
