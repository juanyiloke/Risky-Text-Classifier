ÊDoes it count as a binge?? D:Starting to think that maybe I binge without having realized that's what I was doing?I mean... typically I don't eat a lot through the day. I'm terrified of using up my allotted calories through the day, so I avoid it. I munch on really low calorie foods, and at the end of the day, I'm way way under where I need to be. At night I'm always ravenous for this reason. Don't get me wrong, I'm still hugely conscious of what I'm eating and how many calories I'm consuming. I add them up before I eat them to make sure that it doesn't go over what I allow myself daily, but it would scare me just as much to be under that. I know how addictive it is for me personally to hit a new low and then need to aim for that every day. I try to avoid that, because it's been happening a lot lately, but if it gets too much lower it's going to get scary...ÊToday I ended my count severely under my 'allowance'. So I had a snack, which was a vegetable bagel with peanut butter (because that was the only way to reach the goal in one shot) and I was still under, so I had a tablespoon of frozen yogurt. I felt horrible even though I was still under my goal (and I still am, but I refuse to have anything else).ÊNow I'm terrified that this could be classified as a binge? Is that true? The thought just really scares me, because I already feel horrible for having eaten this snack... I feel like I'm going to gain all my weight back because of it.
