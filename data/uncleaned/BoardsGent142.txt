Did you have a violent childhood?I was talking with a friend the other day and I was telling her about the number of fights I was in as a child and the number of violent encounters I was part of or witnessed in general. She was shocked and her reaction was a bit of a realization for me in that I never considered that I had had a violent childhood but when I take a step back from things I see that it was extremely violent. I was in fights all the time, although hand on heart I never started one. I was an easy going kid and never messed with anybody, but where I lived(and it was by no means a bad area) if you ventured beyond your own street and into another part of the estate you were guaranteed somebody would try to kick the **** out of you, just for being on their piece of turf. There were fights over football matches, fights in school, there was gang fights, I saw my bother stabbed, there were fights with travelers. I Remember this guy I knew, for some reason started picking on my younger brother, I confronted him and we got into a fight. It was a fair fight........right up until the moment his older brother pearl harboured me and the two of them beat the **** out of me in the middle of the street. Absolutely nothing was done, no gardai, no parents, it was par for the course, or at least thats how I thought things were done.Im just wondering, was your childhood violent or was it fairly peaceful and fight free?
