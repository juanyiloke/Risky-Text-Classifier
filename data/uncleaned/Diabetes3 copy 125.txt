Re CT Scan and Metformin.A couple of weeks ago I posted re the above. I had been put on Metformin the week before so not familiar with it. I read the leaflet in the box and that's when I saw the bit about the scans. I had chat to the chemist and also my doctor neither of them could give me an answer. In the end I contacted the Scanning Dept and was told that the injection is iodine which highlights the blood vessels . I was to carry on with the Metformin as usual but after the scan to leave it off for 48hrs to allow the iodine to clear the system. Perhaps this will help someone who is not sure what to do if they need a scan.
