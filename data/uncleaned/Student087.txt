Discovered mistakes in my final year project write-up AFTER I handed it inby farmy93Says it in the title! Submitted by research project write-up (final year biomedical science) last month after being absolutely sick of the sight of it after working on it for 4 months - however as I have to now present my research I have to keep going back to it and each time I find a new mistake! Luckily no content errors so far, mainly just formatting errors e.g. not putting some parts of the text in italics that I should have done and putting some parts in bold that I didn't need to and forgetting to put the figure number for one in-text reference to a particular figure. However I currently have a conditional offer for postgraduate study at stake that requires me to get a 2.1 (60%+). I am averaging around 75% in my course so far but as this write-up is worth two whole modules I fear I might have blown the whole thing due to vast amounts of silly little mistakes that I glossed over in my write-up as I had been staring at the damned thing for too long (I realise now I probably should have got someone to proof-read it but I didn't feel like I had the time). Should I be making other plans for next year or is this not something I should be losing sleep over like I currently am? Any words of encouragement/advice much appreciated! SHould I be contacting my personal tutor?
