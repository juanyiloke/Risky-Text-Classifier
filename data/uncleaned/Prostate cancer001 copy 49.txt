Back from 18 month post RT consultation Would have put a simpler heading but it was too like so many other previous posts Anyway i've had the latest test results. PSA still continues to drop slowly. 18 months post adjuvent RT it is now 0.028Only in with the doc 5 minutes if that. However she did say I should now go to a yearly PSA test and not to have a sensitive test in future. I declined to question the rationale as I kind of get it. I'd love to be able park this for a year but do feel it may be a tad early. I thought this was a luxury for post 5 year patients.Just for info and to help others here are my PSA scores as I remember them
