Giving up - good or bad?   tryagainDoes anyone ever worry that they are really unhappy and depressed but not facing up to it properly? I have been diagnosed as having depression in the past, and was on AD's for 15 years but im currently not taking anything'. I dont feel anymore unhappy that i have been for the last 15 years, but the way my family are reacting to me suggests that they think there is something still very wrong with me: when I try to take part in conversations etc, i feel like i am doing or saying something wrong. Perhaps I am so used to myself as 'lonely and depressed' that I accept myself that way, and I can't really imagine or remember myself as anything else, which in some ways makes things easier for me to carry on..
