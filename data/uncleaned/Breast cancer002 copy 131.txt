Triple positive - is chemo necessary?¥	Hi, I have been diagnosed with triple positive BC (ER+7, PR+8 and HER2+), path from WLE showed clear margins and clear lymph nodes.  I'm waiting to see the oncologist but my surgeon seems to think chemo will be required because of HER2+ involvement.   I feel this is overkill - does anyone have experience of triple positive and what have you done?  I really don't want to undergo chemo unless absolutely necessary :(  Would it be dangerous to refuse and just stick with radiotherapy and hormone treatment?  ¥	I can't believe that in just a few weeks I now know what these acronyms and figures mean, all this seemed like gobbledygook back in early March.  ¥	Thanks to to all on this great site. ¥	Lee x
