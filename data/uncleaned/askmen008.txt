Investment advice for single people with no kids2014-09-06, 10:13 AMHi! How is everyone? So I graduated last year (woohoo!!!) and have been working full time. I enjoy my career and I'm just happy that all my hard work of going to college etc etc etc paid off. After years and years of studying my a$$ off and living off on student loans and basically living as a broke college kid, I feel like hey I finally made it and now I can breathe and relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor. YEY me! However now that I have a stable income, I get all these advice from different people about how to invest my paycheck. I'm single, never been married, no kids. Apparently that's the worst thing in the world come tax season. Now all I my life, all I did was focus on school and work along the way just tsp I could finish school. Other than that, I rarely thought of retirement and how to invest one's money. But now people are telling me about buying a house, joining the company 401k (I qualify next year), getting term life insurance and getting whole life insurance, buying gold & stocks etc etc etc. I'm bombarded with so much data that I don't know which is which. I did buy an ebook about white coat investing :-) I'd appreciate any advice from the more financially experienced members. P.S. Im using my ipad and I can't seem to break this post into paragraphs.Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it's inspiring.
