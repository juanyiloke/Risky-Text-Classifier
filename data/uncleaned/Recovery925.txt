things look up xHiyaGood news to combat the loneilness and emptyness, I am joining my local mind charity groups, they run self esteem and wellness groups once a week as well arts and crafts, this may improve my self conifdence, combat the loneilness and give me something to focus on as well as improve my social life. Then at least I will have lots of things to keep me occupied during the week, some friends and help with the depression. Then whilst I'm there Im going to enquire about doing some voluntary work, this could also improve my prospects when looking for jobs and whatnot and also help with my career decisions.Ths would also definitely help with my mood, mental health and basically things will start to look up for me rather than down and miserable, then at least my boyfriend won't complain and be miserable and you never things may just go up and up for me.
