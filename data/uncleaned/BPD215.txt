Êwaiting for a oppointmeantGood afternoon all. I have not long been told i have a personalty disorder of the anti Social kind witch i dont agree with.I have got a full assessment a week Wednesday. But the more i have lookedin to what they think i may have the more i look in to it i belive that the personality disorder is more me is the border line one BPD. Has any one else been told they mite have a anti social personality disorder. And have been miss understood. Because i dont want to be stigmatized in that group. I have never been to jail i had a good up bringing. I no my issue's i just cant understand. How easy the woman put me down as anti social personality disorder. When i hate my self more than any one elese. This is my first post sorry for the punctuality
