New Diabetic NurseI am dreading my appointment on Tuesday. I have a new diabetic nurse due to the move and honestly, it has me in knots. I might not get a nice one and that worries me. I know i haven't been very good these past few weeks, i did start off very well but the more we got into the move, the more tired and in pain i got, so i admit i got blooming lazy. So i know if they do my HbA1c anytime soon, it won't be a good result   that is my own fault and i will admit it to the person on Tuesday. But starting today i am firmly back on track
