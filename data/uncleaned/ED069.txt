alcohol and copingHi! So I've been on a wait list for professional help for over 6 months and have been trying to find ways to cope in by he meantime. I know alcohol is a stupid resource but it's a short reprieve giving me some breathing time. My question ismall which is worse (and I dont drink this much often) but is it ok to throw up after a heavy night, even though you know you'll feel better despite the fact it could.be triggerIng. Ideally I never want to throw up again but after accidentally drinking toour much I guess in asking permission?? Sorry, I'm doing the beat with what I have :(
