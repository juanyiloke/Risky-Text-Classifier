newly diagnosed   I am 24 years old and was diagnosed diabetic around this time last year, I am just about getting used to my injections now but still find it very frustrating, I have not been able to talk to people about it much because a lot of people don't understand what diabeties is.My friends are very supportive, and work collegues have been great. I find it difficult sometimes not being able to talk to other people with diabeties because it is something that you can not see, it is very difficult to notice if someone has it.i would love to be able to talk to others who have only just been diagnosed with this as for a while i went into denial and i want to know if this is normal
