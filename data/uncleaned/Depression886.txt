I hate lifeI hate life, plain and simple. Always have, always will. I never wanted to be here. I hate how unfair it is. I hate all the feelings that I get. I hate being human, an animal. I hate having needs. I hate who I am, and I hate trying to make things better. I hate pretending everything's alright. I hate eating, I hate working, I hate sleeping, I hate the way people look at me. Life is so boring to me. There isn't that much in existence to see or experience. People say, "oh well you should travel then". So I'm going to go spend hours driving or flying on airplanes which I hate, then spend a fortune on a hotel somewhere that I am not comfortable in, just to see something other than the "norm". Just different climates, species of trees, maybe some water. Just feeling really negative today.
