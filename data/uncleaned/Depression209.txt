  Intrusive Thoughts  MarlieeBee, 2   12Before I start. I have no intention in doing anything of what I am about to type. These are just thoughts and I know 100% it's not going to happen so please don't worry Over the past couple of days I have had thoughts of me dying in a certain way to the detail. I was lying in bed particularly last night mapping the thought out and thinking about the aftermath of it.Of course I can't go into detail of what is it but it would effect a lot of people and it could actually seriously injure or kill others, that is the main reason why it won't happen because I would never let anyone get hurt or killed by my actions.Of course I have tried all the distractions I can think of but I can't get it out of my head.What I find most weird is the fact that I am perfectly calm about it, relaxed. Maybe it's because I know it won't happen, actually that most likely is the case but having these kinds of thoughts are well, not at all normal but I feel like it's just a normal day to day thought.Can anyone make sense of it, cause I certainly can't?Thank you for readingxxx
