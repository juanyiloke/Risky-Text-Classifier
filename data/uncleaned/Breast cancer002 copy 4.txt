If a nurse doesn't even know.... !!I went to have a heart scan a few days ago and the nurse started asking me questions about my chemotherapy. I was a little confused as to why she was asking me until she revealed that her 55 year old mother had just been diagnosed with stage 4 liver and bone cancer. My jaw dropped. Poor thing!!Her mother had just started EC chemo and was suffering from a lot of side effects including constipation and acid reflux as well as nausea. The nurse had no idea that chemo stripped the gut of it's cells and that was why her mother was suffering from acid reflux. Her poor mother was blaming good old dad for feeding her the wrong food!! She was also confused about being constipated. Of course that's what the drugs do to you.The nurse was shocked that 'they' had just given her mother chemo and not told her about any of these things or HOW to help herself post chemo. The nurse said each time her mother complained, she resorted to Googling it for some help, but rarely found anything useful. I felt so sorry for her.I've seen some posts on here about Chemo Survival and I've even written one myself, on my blog to help people. I gave my nurse the web page address and I really hope I have helped her mom in some small way.If anyone else wants to take a look, here is the link to the page:Lots of Love people! Onwards and upwards.xxxx
