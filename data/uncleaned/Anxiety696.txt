a couple of days of feeling ok..then today bad againJust dont understand it.iv had my first couple of days in ages feeling not to bad at all.then today when waking,its all back again...feel hyper aware of things,everything seems to be in my face.things i look at things i feel.yesterday was a good day for me,i didnt do any internal thinking and felt quite relaxed and my day just went by without any heavy thinking about things.but today its all back.unable to concentrate or feel relaxed..heavy head and foggy feeling and over thinking and worrying about everything and suffering DP which i hate the most,feel like im watching myself like a fly on the wall.why can we have a couple of good days then it switch back on again..i had a good 8 hrs sleep
