One aspect of university that worries me....by CautiousCatNow before I write this I'm in no way a shallow person and I hope that people will understand where I'm coming from and maybe even relate.So I'm starting my first year at university in September and am really worried that I won't get on with my apartment friends. I've always been know to be a guy who gets on with anyone, I'm friendly, have a sense of humour without sounding arrogant.What I don't want are people who are the complete opposite to me and almost shut themselves away from everyone. I feel like if you're living with these people for a year it would make sense to be more out in the open but obviously some people aren't that way incline and I totally understand that. I just get worried that I'll basically have no friends at university and it will be really upsetting and almost depressing.. Anyone relate?
