Identity Theft2014-05-30, 12:36 PMI just got a letter in the mail from my former employer saying their computer system was hacked into and that they have evidence that a hacker has had access to all of our personal information (name, address, phone number, social security number, income, banking information, etc). It said I'm now at risk for identity theft and am supposed to get credit reports and place some kind of freeze alerts to stop people from opening credit cards and things with my identity. But I have no idea what I'm doing or how to go about any of this. Help!
