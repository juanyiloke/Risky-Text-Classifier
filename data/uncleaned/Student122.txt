Help me decide whether to go to Uni...!!!by sandsiiI'm currently on a gap year after deciding against going last year. I have a job, my family close by and a comfortable life but my social life sucks, since all my friends went to Uni last year, I literally have zero friends now. I never intended to go to Uni, I was pressurised by my Mum, school and friends to go and get a good degree, and as a result, a good career but I never felt that urge like most people do. After applying for a second time, I am once again having serious doubts whether to go or not. I hear all the time about how much fun it is but i've never wanted to leave home. My dad, who is divorced and who I live alone with, is begging me to stay and it would be hard to leave him as we are very close, almost best mates. We work together and pretty much do everything together now but I also don't want to stay in my comfort zone with no friends for the rest of my life and I see Uni as my only opportunity to meet new people.I'm sure if I did go I'd make new friends and have loads of fun but I just can't decide/push myself to go. I have extreme moodswings on my thoughts on whether to go or not and its getting me depressed. What is Uni life like? Is it easy to settle in? Can you go home often?Can you drop out easily if you hate it?I need some inspiring words/advice on what I should do as I really cannot decide. If I go i'll let my dad down, if I stay i'll let my mum down and whatever decision I make I can see myself regretting
