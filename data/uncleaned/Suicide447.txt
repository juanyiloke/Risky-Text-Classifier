No hope aheadno hope for joeMy life has no future now because of health and financial issues. First of all, I was diagnosed with hsv when I was younger; therefore, decreased my opportunity for finding a significant other. Secondly, my doctor said I have contacted hepatitis and need to start treatment. In addition, my current debt will not help me in financing the treatment needed for hepatitis treatment. The past year has been attending school and jumping into a new professional field, but it has landed me a job which barely gets me by. I am 42 years old and it appears my health and opportunities have decreased. All in all, my liver may give out, my finances are drained, and my love life is gone.
