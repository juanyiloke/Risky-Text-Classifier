Out of control, controlling myself.Hi,I'm new here, but I needed somewhere to say that I am not in control anymore.I now purge after every time I eat anything at all, even though that may seem normal to some of you out there, this is not normal to me.ÊI am in hospital and they don't know I have bulimia because i am here from a suicide attempt, I am doing much better on that front now though.There's so much of this that is me trying to control everything, and in turn I am controlling nothing.I don't need replies I just needed to know that I had actually admitted it somewhere.thanks.
