How can I learnI was never very good at English language when I was at school, I struggled with verbs and adjectives and spelling has always been my downfall.Ê I do have an English 'O' level but at a lowish grade, I think 4 or 5.I've been thinking of finding a new hobby now I've reached 70 and would love to start English from scratch, revising what a verb and adverb are and where they fit into a sentence.Ê But where do I start?Ê I'd prefer it online as I'd like to fit it into my hectic life, hectic through the fact that my husband has cancer which they're finding hard to treat and we have to spend a lot of time back and forth at the hospital 30 miles away.Can anyone give me any suggestions?
