Do You Catch Flack Over Self-care Or Time For Yourself?I want to get back to taking a little time in each day to work out - not only want to, but desperately need to. When I fell apart in 2012, one good thing came out of it, I was very overweight, eating a terrible diet, and it had been at least a decade since I had purposely exercised for its own sake. I turned that all around nicely and really got myself back on track.Then I fell apart again emotiomally around early March due to a series of stressful and triggering life events - and I am doing all of tne wrong things - very rarely make it to the gym, stress-eating crap, gaining weight.Right now I really am stretched thin in terms of time, almost all of my non-working hours revolve around being a primary caregiver for an ailing elderly relative.I was so depressed for a coupe of months I wanted to try to get myself back on track but couldn't. Now I want to and actually have the energy just a bit, but many days like this morning it's another of a series of non-ending crises where I get a "come right now" call from the nursing home. So that is one problem, crises. Another is just plain time, get up at like 5 or 6 am to go before work, then spend all evening there too, crash into bed late, then lather rinse repeat.But the worst thing is other family members who complain or criticize but don't help - and have no understanding of why self-care is important because they don't do it for themselves
