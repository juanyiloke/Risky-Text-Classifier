with my pdocs encouragement and approval I went off of Invega after weening down four four months. I went four days without meds before my backup antipsychotic script for Abilify could be filled. It's been six hours since I took the first pill, and I feel like the angelic choirs are singing, I'm not all the way back to myself but feeling a lot better. If you are thinking of going off your meds without pdoc approval DONT DO IT. I can tell you from doing it with the pdocs blessing that it was rough, in hindsight, I should have filled the script before stopping the last pill. But I don't think we are going to be trying that again anytime soon.
