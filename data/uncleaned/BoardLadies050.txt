the body clock lectureHi What do you do with the body clock lecture, the one where older workmates talk about you have to be 36 max to have kids, time running out, etc. I didn't want to be rude, I like the two women otherwise. But I was happy this morning until they started talking, in general terms about this stuff again. It pops up every few months. I'm single, now 40 and it'll probably never happen to me. And I'm OK with that till aulder wans start up. People drink, smoke, eat too much. And it's no one else's business. No need for moralising hypothesized, generalized lectures. Coz concern sometimes works out as offensive. I needed to rant all day. I almost got knocked down too. But then the poor people of Baga had it much worse. How do people here handle this, coz it's gonna get worse. Even the doctor said it on a recent visit. Ffs.
