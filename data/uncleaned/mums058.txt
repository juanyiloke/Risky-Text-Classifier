Hi,I wondered if I could ask a question about homework in reception?My son is to be 5 next week. He is a super-keen reader and is on Oxford Reading Tree stage 14, even though I didn't teach him to read before starting school.ÊHe hates writing and drawing (so do I) and any kind of writing homework is treated as an opportunity to act up and misbehave (and finally relent and draw a big poo on the book).We've been so proud of his reading, and just tried to be supportive of the little he could manage in writing. But now suddenly he is getting word lists that he has to copy out, with up to 15 words in the list, twice a week. I did manage to get him through the list today, but it was very very confrontational and not at all a pleasant experience for either of us.ÊI feel that he has years to get to grips with writing and I've no idea why there is such urgency to get him writing well immediately, right now, and without fail.ÊI wondered - is anyone else getting this kind of homework burden as such a young age? Is it Michael Gove's fault? I don't remember any of this kind of frantic-ness when I was this age.ÊAdmittedly I went to a weird fee-paying school where they somehow forgot to give my any reading books until primary 2. (ooops)Any second opinions much appreciated.
