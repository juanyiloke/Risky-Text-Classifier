Eating problemsOk for the last few months I've been unable to keep up a healthy diet. I often eat one meal a day which sometimes I often do not finish. After that is a snack or 2 and then I'm done for the day. This caused problems with my periods, making them go all over the place, last too long or be more painful, or in most cases, stop for a few days and then start again. I have suffered a problem before when I had stomachaches after I ate but I didn't see a doctor about that and it went away after a month or so. I also had a problem with acidic things causing my stomach to hurt. Recently though, I refuse to eat a lot due to stomach aches, or constipation. I'll get constipation for a few days before finally being able to go, but due to the aches it causes, I tend to eat less. I've been to the doctor about it, and she says she thinks it's mental related. I have no care about my weight whatsoever and I blame it on the aches I get. My iron is low and so is my Folic acid. I wondered if anyone might know what's going on with these stomach pains, constipation and my lack of eating? I also feel weak a lot due to I don't tend to spend a lot of time outside.
