I hate my life so much and feel completely trappedHi, sorry if this is in the wrong section, it's a bit of everything so i'd figured i'd put it here.Basically i'm 15 and am not attending school because of a severe anxiety disorder with has lead to depression, social anxiety and binge eating. (if anybody is wondering i'm self teaching myself maths and english with the help of some tutors and am working on an art gcse for now, i'm hoping to take them next year, i have no idea what to do with my life, i want to do photography or some sort of creative thing at university but i'm not sure if i'd get in and i don't really want to think about that right now because it terrifies me)My main problem right now is feeling completely trapped, and not just metaphorically, I live in a crappy area, there are no nearby cafes or shops, I have nowhere to go to keep myself busy when i'm not working, i'm completely lonely and feel claustrophobic stuck in a small house with my family, i hate it and want to move out as soon as possible, which is at least 3 years  everyday i sleep in til 10.30, get dressed, sit on my laptop, do as little work as possible, sit on my laptop, get moaned at by my mum, feel trapped even more and eat, I hate it, it's no life and everyday i feel like  there is no reason to live. I'm not good at anything meaning I have no hobbies, I'm too anxious to get the bus anywhere, i have no money to go out so i just dwell about how bad life is day after day.I can't handle living in a house with 4 other people, they don't understand my illnesses and my parents turn the wifi off at 11pm so I always have to sneak downstairs to use the computer (sounds like a first world problem, but i get so lonely and stressed out without access to the internet, i love to blog and talk to people on the internet and it's horrible when that's taken away from you)to summarise it up: i'm trapped in my house with nothing to do and I feel like I can't handle it anymore, I need to get out, I need to go places by myself and I need to get away from my family
