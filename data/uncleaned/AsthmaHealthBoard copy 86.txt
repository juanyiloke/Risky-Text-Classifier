confused! Asthma or not!________________________________________Hi allThis is my first post. I am a 48 year old female who got a cold in January and just never seemed to beat it. 6 weeks ago I had an ear infection and sinuses were still running. I was given antibiotics and the ear cleared up but while I was on meds I got a cough and OMG it is something. I went back to the Dr and she asked if I was wheezing and I said yes sometimes I am. She heard something when checking my back. She prescribed Advair 125/25 and singular and set up an appointment for two weeks later. Today was the appointment. I have not improved near as much as I had hoped! Still coughing, tight chest and just annoying. The clear mucus is less which is a good thing. She listened again today and she said the right side was not good but the left seemed okay. She prescribed ventolin 4 to 6 times a day for a week and I am continue the other medication. I was also sent off for a chest xray.SO can you have asthma if one side is bad. I am nervous as my dad died of lung cancer though he smoked a ton and I do not smoke at all. Any insight would be helpfulThanks in advanceKatie
