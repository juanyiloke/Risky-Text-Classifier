Hello! If youâÄ™re reading this you must want to know how I cured my PTSD. Well Dr's and modern medicine know how to treat illnesses not usually cure them. I know this from my own personal journey of healing Two Autoimmune diseases and PTSD and IâÄ™m only 31 years old! I was born with an illness that went into remission and awoke as I entered my 20's. I was diagnosed with my first autoimmune disease that was similar to RA- Rheumatoid Arthritis back in 2007. It took 7 years, thousands of dollars and many different types of doctors on two coasts to diagnose and cure me. Since then I have had almost 100% health and I decided I wanted to make a difference and help others with my personal healing story. So I decided to go to school to learn about the methods that cured me. I was cured by an MD who was a whole foods nutritionist as well as a Reiki Master (energy healing). So I went to school and now I am a Nutrition Consultant and energy healer. As I was about to start school my little girls life was in jeopardy. Going thru that triggered PTSD and it took a few months to become diagnosed with pretty severe PTSD. It took about a year and a short but common setback to Completely treat and Heal this illness. A year later I am still going strong and healthier than ever!!! I've graduated school, created a healthy relationship, and now I'm teaching others at my school how to heal themselves in every way- mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. I accomplished all this WHILE going thru PTSD treatment. All of these accomplishments were virtually Impossible a year ago!
