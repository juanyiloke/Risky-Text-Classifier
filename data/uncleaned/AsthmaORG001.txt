best gargling liquid? I've been having problems with my throat and have totally lost my voice (since mid january!).The ENT consultant wanted me to come off seretide cos he said the high steroid content isn't good for the throat. Happily my GP is happy for me to stay on it but i want to be able to show ENT that i can be ok on seretide.Anyway, i realised i didn't always rinse / gargle properly so i've decided that's my next step - is there any solution better than water for getting rid of inhaler residue from the back of my throat? For the past couple of weeks i have been gargling regularly after almost every dose of seretide but wondered if there was anything better than water such as saltwater / mouthwash etc, is cold or hot better?
