This Country Is Ridiculous When It Come To Asthma Does anyone else feel this way? I am from Australia and have severe Asthma and need to carry a puffer with me where ever I go. Now what happens if I forget it at home or misplace it ... just like many people each day would do with their keys? Well I would always just go up and buy a new one from the pharmacy, when I was back home in Aus, no prescription needed.Coming to the UK I have had nothing but trouble, firstly figuring out when I first got here that I had to register with a doctor, then knowing that if that doctor was busy I can't go and see anyone else especially if you work far away (unless you want to sacrifice the whole day and go to a walk in centre), never the less the one doctor I was registered with was crap and the nurse then told me I should not take ventolin I should use the symbicort as a reliever... SYMBICORT SPECIFICALLY LABELS NOT NOT USE IT AS A RELIEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for the near death experience NHS!!!Basically as the sight says every 10 minutes someone has a potentially fatal asthma attack yet if I was required to go into a pharmacy to get a puffer to possibly save that persons life.... I can't nor I I knew one was coming on and I ran out or forgot it I could not get the life saving medication I need.But hey thats alright cause if I want illegal drugs its heaps more accessible over here and at least they would probably even be polite and deliver it (I am not say I take drug I just pointing out the obvious)
