I'm 14 and I've heard voices in my head telling me to hurt myself and that someone will hurt me ever since I was little.I cut myself to see if maybe these voices would stop. Right now it has come to the point where I don't sleep for a whole day. Sometimes I get extremely scared and just remain motionless and stare into nothing hopeing that the voices go away. Ive also starting to feel something pokeing me. Ive told my mom a ton of times but she just tells me that she's gonna send me to a mental hospital.she and my dad also tell me that Im rreally aggressive. Im worried that i might hurt someone again.They say one minute Im happy and fine and the next im angry and in one of my moods when I ignore them. I don't know if im paranoid, crazy or if im schizophrenic I have no idea if I should get help or just ignore it and hope it will get better...
