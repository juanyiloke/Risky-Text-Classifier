ÊDon't know what to doThis is a post mainly about my girlfriend and me trying to help her through it.In short she has a very hard time eating any meal and there is no evident biological cause. Eating makes her feel sick to her stomach. In the mornings (and often through out the day) she purges to feel better. In addition to this she is constantly on edge. If the littlest thing goes wrong I have to convince her just to keep going and not give up. It almost feels like she's given up hope on everything.I love this woman to death and I'm at the end of my wits with what to do or how I can best support her. I've tried brining it up to her and she insists she is getting better, but, she just keeps going In the same cycles. The idea of leaving her isn't even In my mind, I just want to help her the best way I can.
