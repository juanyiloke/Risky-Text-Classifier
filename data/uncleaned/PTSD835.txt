ÊBad bad - f*cking bad - shakingIt's been bad.Last night I had nightmares to do with my brother, situations that weren't nice.Very stressful, woke up feeling knackered.Went back to sleep this afternoon, more nightmares about him.This evening, my neighbour who's been harassing me for a while with trying to get me to have a conversation and who keeps coming out of his flat whenever I go outside crossed the line.I went out earlier to go to the supermarket, as I came out he asked me where I was going. He hasn't done this before - it was weird and quite frankly none of his fucking business.I came back in my car and he came outside walked around the car park with his penis out.I waited in my car for him to go back inside, he didn't.I bailed out and let myself into the building as quick as possible without looking at him.I have called the police and waiting for them to arrive. I hpoe they don't bring up my past mental health stuff and imply that i'm making it up.I'm really shaking, my whole body is tense and I want to pass out. Fuck, it's been a fuckng shit 24 hours.I don't feel real, my muscles are screaming.I went iinto the refuge to get away from my asshole brother who threatened me sexually when I didn't give him money for alcohol.Why is my neighbour doing this to me?
