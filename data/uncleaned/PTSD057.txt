Finally Seeing ProgressI've been away from the forums for probably a year, at least, so I was going to just post another intro, but it wouldn't let me. So anyway, for roughly the past 24 years, I had felt like I had not been living life. I don't know if anyone here has felt this way, but it was almost like I was just going through the motions. Anyway, back in 2013, I got into my first "real" relationship, with a girl I met online, and I feel like that may be what started shaking me out of it. We did the whole online long-distance thing for a few years prior, then she moved in with me for 6 months, during which I had one of the loudest wake-up calls I've ever had. Aside from her being borderline and bipolar, she ended up being just flat out crazy. When she took off in my van one day and left me stranded at home, that was the last straw. I sent her packing ASAP. But I digress, on to the progress...now that I don't have to put up with her anymore, I have found very strange things happening. I got a hair transplant first off, which could have caused all the rest, honestly. I have been updating my wardrobe, keeping my house cleaner, I have been talking to people more for the first time ever. I am actually caring about things that I never once thought I would. The only bad thing is, now that I'm starting to care, I can see how bad things really were, which sort of creates a paradox. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?
