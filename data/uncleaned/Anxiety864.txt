Êgetting a strong 'voice'hello forum users, I have two weeks off work,been drinking too much and I have had anxiety in the past. I saw my doctor but was just not able to say I am getting thoughts in my mind regarding suicide to be blunt.I don't think this is right with anxiety,new to me anyway.I,m trying hard to see the dumb side of my thinking. I have tried to talk(e-mail) Samaritans but it takes 24 hours for replies. I cannot talk to my family, they know of course that I'm off work for my nerves,also worrying about my job of course.I'm really making people fed up too.Just feels better to type it all.
