Diabetes and food  about a month agoi was diagnosed with diabetes feb 2013 and have been on oral medication since August 2014 and it is at the moment well controlled. I have been on a diabetes education day and had several talks with the practice nurse who has had additional training in managing diabetes. However just recenlt I have become confused about mealtimes. Neither the practice nurse nor the education day said anything about the importance of having meals at a set time each day but talking to friends who have been diabetic for many years they all say I have to eat at set times each day if I want to keep my blood sugar stable. However my blood sugar is stable even though I do not have my meals at set times so I am confused. Please could someone give me the benefit of their experience?
