Leaving the nest2014-05-19, 10:09 PMHi all,I just moved out of my parents home about 5 months ago as a 20 year old (just turned 21 in early may). I'm now living in Brooklyn as a free lance photographer and just got back from visiting home and seeing all my friends and family, literally today. For maybe the first time I'm having a lot of anxiety about living on my own and making this 'life' thing work. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for by posting this- I guess any advice you guys might have, personal stories..ÊHow can I keep that home, safe, family feeling without moving back home?thanks for reading guys. I really look forward to your responses.
