Ptsd Diagnosis As EnablingThis post might be a bit controversial, but bear with me. I think it is worth discussion. I have been examining my life pre-PTSDdiagnosis and after, and am wondering if the diagnosis didn't enable me in some ways. Prior to the diagnosis, I engaged in reckless behavior and drank excessively -- both of which are clearly very bad and detrimental. The diagnosis helped me pinpoint why I was doing those things and I was able to regain some self-control after learning the reasons for such behaviors. But I also went through a period (after the diagnosis) in which I sort of molly-coddled myself, giving in to anxiety and hiding indoors for days at a time, avoiding any sort of social interaction. I justified these things by telling myself that it was what I needed and crucial to keep my psyche in tact. Now, I feel like I have found a healthy in-between, in which I don't give in to anxiety and instead I force myself to do things that make me nervous but also avoid excessive drinking and recklessness. I do feel like the diagnosis enabled me for a short while, and that if I hadn't accepted this new job, I might still be stuck in that phase. Has anyone else gone through this? Am i wrong for thinking that the diagnosis could be (and was for me) something of an enabler? it allowed me to tell myself I was weak and broken and different from everyone else ... but is that really a healthy way of looking at it? I don't think so. Perhaps this is just the normal trajectory of PTSD and we all have to find the healthy middleground for ourselves. I don't know. But I definitely think the diagnosis enabled me for a short period and drove me into a self-pitying state. Thoughts?
