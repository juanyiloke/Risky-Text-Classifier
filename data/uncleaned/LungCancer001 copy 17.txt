  Stage IV Lung cancer in an OLD guyI've been along time off-and-on viewer here. I'll be around more now with my new login name. A little background: At 72 I'm in pretty good shape except for myasthenia gravis and stage IV lung cancer.My right lower lobe was removed in 11/09 followed by heavy chemo in early 2010. 2011 CT's showed minor “tree & bud” structures in both lungs which slowly increased. No major mass shown, so washes and guided needle biopsy where just an exercise. Finally got a needle biopsy that worked: Well-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with features of bromcho-alveolar carcinoma. (Still well diffused along bronchial paths' with no major 'mass' anywhere; and I can maintain 96-98% oxygen.) I'll get a full CT in early Jan 2013 to establish a new baseline. I'll start Alimta in January 'cause I did not have any of the markers for targeted treatment. I'd like to hear from Alimta users to know what to expect.Hopefully I'll be hanging around here for a while..
