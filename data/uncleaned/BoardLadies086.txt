Caring for bras!I hate bras. It is rare when you find one that fits perfectly, but recently I have, so over the past two months,I bought six of them. I promised myself that I would start handwashing them so I handwashed my first one this morning! I am hoping that it adds to their lifespan, as I find that the underwire constantly pops out of my bras trying to puncture my heart!ÊDo you do anything special to care for your bras? Handwashing or delicate spin on the washing machine? Or are you like me, where they get flung into the machine in order of the colours they match?
