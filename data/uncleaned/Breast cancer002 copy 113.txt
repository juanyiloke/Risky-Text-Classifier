chemo being stopped¥	Hi  I am new to this, but has anyone heard of chemo being stopped due to there margins being under 3.¥	I was one of those people on boarder line breast cancer, I had a mascetomy in Jan 21st this year and lymph nodes all clear  and then it was my choice to have chemo, so after a think I have had 3 out 6 treatments of FEC, now I am wondering what has it benefited me and have my margins gone down.¥	I see my oncloycist on the 30th april and 4th treatment 1st may¥	just want to see all options before I make my mind up
