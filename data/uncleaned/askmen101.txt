Sticking with your passion or going for the $$$2012-04-18, 07:52 PMI am currently caught between a decision that will have a big impact on my immediate future.ÊI have 1 year left in college and just recently set some great short term goals for myself. I am a Sports Management major and plan on starting my own sports performance company this summer. I also just got offered an unpaid coaching position but it sounds like the experience and opportunity to learn and grow as a coach and person are great for me.ÊOn the flip side I was offered a job in oil service industry that pays very well on a 2 weeks on two weeks off cycle. The window for hiring in the company is open now and it seems like a great opportunity. My uncle works for them and they are an international company that takes good care of their people.ÊI can stick to what I am doing, college, coaching and working on my own business but I am broke....I can put that on the side and go make some serious money, take some online classes to keep the college moving, and work on the business on my two weeks off. This would probably delay my graduation from an extra year or two.ÊWhat would you do? Stay in school full time and push through...or leave it all(most of it all) for a good paying job now.??
