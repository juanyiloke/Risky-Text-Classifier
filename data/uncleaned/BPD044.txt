inpatientby AutumnLeaves » Wed Jun 03, 2015 4:29 pmLooks like I'm on the brink of going inpatient again. I just hate it so much there it's not even the whole experience it isn't like the people and docs suck and that I'm locked in a padded room in a jacket. I just can't have my cell phone or music also can only smoke cigarettes at scheduled times the smoking area is a caged in porch on the 20th floor of a high rise building. They don't understand they are taking away my only devices that keep me somewhat sane. I don't want to stare out into the sky from up there behind a cage I want to listen to my music and be able to talk to my boyfriend because he can't visit me he works during visiting hours and I have no family or friends in this state, last time I had no visitors it made me feel worse the only thing that place does is "keep you safe" I'm getting so tired of hearing that word "SAFE" I don't want to be safe anymore but I'm not keen on hurting more people even in death I have nephews that just would never understand or accept that their Aunt won't be coming back so in all honesty it is my nephews that have been keeping me safe the oldest is only 11 the youngest is 1 and I love them. I am in so much pain. Oh and on top of all that if I did go I'd be the 4th person in my family that died before the age of 30 and my family reunion is starting again for the first time in 6 years since the deaths of all my cousins.
