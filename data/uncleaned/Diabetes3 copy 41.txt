Pump and operationGot to be in hospital at 730 for keyhole surgery on my knee tomorrow , they told me to cut my basal rate to 50% tonight , but haven't really explained what will happen during the op with my pump , having a general does anyone know if I will keep pump on lower basal , rather than be put on a sliding scale that totally makes my bloods sugars go through the roof for days afterwards , has anyone on pump any knowledge of what happens please
