Tips for Summer Research? (Intern Season edition)2014-05-29, 10:49 PMSo I'm interning this summer for a relevant-to-my-future university and want to leave a good impression. It's computer science-y. Going with two other students from my college (by chance and by recruitment), don't know any of the other interns. It's a small group.ÊOnly other relevant thing I can think of is the guy in my class year (who I've known for a while) is someone I dislike- he lies easily (not that I mind; good for him, but can't trust him) and we'll be working together on the same project. He has a history of leeching off me (he'll ask me to do this or that for him and shower me with complements, even offer money but if you haven't guessed he doesn't pay lol and I'm pretty sure he dislikes me point blank). I'm 98% confident that should I go in without a plan he'll wind up taking credit for my work while drinking excessively and showing up late on the reg while contributing nothing much (he does these things anyways). He has fucking *great* social skills. Best "manipulator" of anyone I've ever met. How do I counter this *and* use him to my advantage?Any other tips? From what to wear to what to say to what to do?ÊI leave tomorrow.
