Finishing palliative chemoI decided to stop adjuvant chemo at 10 out of 12 sessions. Need my body to get back to normal or not at all. No compromises. Not good with support, prefer to go things alone, am also combating Cancer through an excellent medical consultant /lecturer with other means aside from chemo. Have twofold plans.1) enjoy the rest of my retirement with my sport, personal training, cardio and stretching plus good holidays given the opportunity2) if worst case scenario become terminal make sure Dignitas or similar provide me an exit when needed. But no palliative chemo for me. No half a life. And no pain. Just end it.
