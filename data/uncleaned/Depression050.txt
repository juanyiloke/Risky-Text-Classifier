My mind feels so heavy Hello, my name is Stephanie, and I think life is amazing, however, I just always feel 'bleuh'! I have a loving family, close friends and a job at a great place and from the surface my life looks great, and it is. This is why I'm finding it hard to understand, I want to travel the world, see it all, take part in activities, do things and give it all a go. I'm the least judgmental person ever and try and remain a moral, loving person. I know there are loads of things to make me happy, like my family, friends, a great book, movie, or music, seeing something amazing, but then I wonder why I even bother, what is it all for, everytime I try and smile my mind brings me back to the darkness, I'm not a serious person, I'm very laid back and enjoy jokes, and compromise and am up for anything, I have no real big plans and so live spontaneously and don't get disappointed, I'm also not easily stressed or worried about trivial things like bills or a break up because life moves on, so why then am I so low? Why do I get told everywhere I go that I'm quiet? Why do people think I'm sad - assuming I've had something bad happen to me fairly recently. I'm always being told to smile and have fun, and yet out of a lot of my friends, I don't moan over petty things like a broken phone, or being stood up, or silliness, but see the whole bigger picture of the world and life. It's amazing, and yet horrible, and sometimes I wonder what the hell is going on... and why?... am I depressed? I've tried to change, to snap out of it, I'm a very motivated person, I don't take drugs and so on, I exercise and studied and look after my body, why can I laugh and smile at things and see the beauty of them and yet feel 24/7 down... I just don't understand, please please help me!
