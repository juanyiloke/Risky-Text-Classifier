Project dissertation reportsby Ybsy75Why do so many people spend so much time on their project reports, especially the literature review and sacrifice exam revision time. I can understand it's important when the dissertation itself is counts towards most of the year but in many science courses it's part of a project. And the report is only worth about 10% of the year which is much less than the total for final exams. Also when it's part of a project, the underlying project work throughout the year etx is worth much more than the report.
