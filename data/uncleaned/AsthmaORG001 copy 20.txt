What just happened?! Hi guysJust freaked myself out a little, can anyone explain this?I've been struggling with asthma all week, brought on by hay fever. I've increased my inhalers but haven't noticed any difference yet. Today has been worse than normal, but then I have been carrying heavy shopping up steep hills all day so that might be it! I've just got into bed and suddenly couldn't catch my breath at all and was breathing like I'd just finished a marathon! It took 4 puffs of ventolin before I felt like I was getting any air in and a couple more puffs before I could have some control over my breathing and force myself to calm down. I still can't take breaths as deep as I want to but I feel ok, just shaky from the ventolin. I really don't know what this was of why it happened. Maybe I'm just being paranoid because I know I'm on my own.I just feel very alone right now and bed some reassurance. Usually the second I have issues with asthma I can message my flatmates and they'll be there instantly. If for some reason they aren't around I have friends who live nearby. Unfortunately I've come back to uni before them and so I'm in an empty flat.Can I have a virtual hug please?
