While on seretide inhaler 125 i had very little use of my ventolin inhaler.This carried on for several years until my practice nurse decided that my treatment should be changed to a new inhaler named symbicort.From day one it was obvious that symbicort was not controlling my condition despite taking up to 8 inhalations daily and of course a massive increase in ventolin up to two inhalers each month.The doctors and nurses were not greatly concerned until recently i had a major chest infection and asthma attack.I am now back on seretide 250,taken 4 times daily and again very little use of ventolin now required
