Any advice?
I feel like my eating is the worst its ever been.... I CANT handle the cravings I have to eat in large quantities to get through the day!! Its awful..... sometimes I feel really overwhelmed with the cravings all of the time. Currently I'm on buspar and I have been on it for 2 weeks... so far it just seems to make food taste better, has anyone else been on it?
I was on Wellbutrin previously for 3 months.... it HELPED so much I was able to handle the cravings and they even started going away! I felt so much better but I want a child.... so I tapered off of it and thought I could handle life on my own because I was getting more done in a day... well I had a relapse. Now I dont want to do anything but sit around the house and eat all day. Obviously I cant because I work full time and because I have a daughter but depression and sugary foods are making things really difficult.
I don't really have anyone to talk to except my husband but it is not helping our marriage thats for sure.
