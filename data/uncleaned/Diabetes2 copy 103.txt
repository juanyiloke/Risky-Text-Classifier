DIABEIS AND TRAVELLING   [size=18:5fb91c7d96][/size:5fb91c7d96][color=darkblue:5fb91c7d96][/color:5fb91c7d96] 8) HELLO i HAVE BEEN DIABETIC TYPE 2 FOR 3 YEARS. i N THAT TIME i HAVE BEEN LIVING ABROAD FOR 2 YEARS BETWEEN ASIA AND AUSTRALIA. MY EXPERIENCE WITH AUSTRALIAN DOCTORS IS DAUNTING! ITS MORE DOCTORS FEEES THAN DOCTORS CARE! i WAS PUT ON DIAMACRON BUT IT MADE ME SO ILL , I WAS HAVING HYPOS ALL THE TIME, IT MADE ME VERY STRESSED. OM MY RETURN TO ASIA, I BOUGHT MY METPHORMINE OVER THE COUNTER AND DISPENSED WITH THE DIAMACROM, i WALK REGULARLY EACH DAY FOR 2hrs, MY BLOOD SUGAR SHOWS AROUND 7 .00 IN THE MORNING BUT FALLS TO A LOW LEVEL AFTER EXERCISE. i THINK i EAT HEALTHY! BUT STILL CRAVE A BIT OF CHOCOLATE OR A BISCUIT DURING THE DAY. i ALSO LIKE A DRINK IN THE EVENING BUT DONT TOUCH SOFT DRINKS OR BEER. i MISS THE CARE THAT BRITAIN OFFERS AND THE SUPPORT OF THE CLINIC. i THINK i AM DOING OK, i LOOK HEALTHY AND FEEL HEALTHY TOO! i JUST FEEL ISOLATED!!
