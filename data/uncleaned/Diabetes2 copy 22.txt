Pre diabetic?  3  In December, fasting blood work where I currently live (Hungary) to keep an eye on my high ALT and GGT turned up a slightly high fasting blood sugar of 6 mmol/l.Advised to excercise and lose a bit of weight (173cm/76kg) and do a checkup in 6 months, I kept up my 2-3 times a week running and went on a 6 week low carb, low cal diet in January. Also bought a home glucose meter.At the end of 6 weeks I had lost ~6 kg (70kg now) but suddenly started to develop severe night time dry mouth, thirst and need to urinate quite drequently and copiously, like a switch turned on in the 5th week of the diet. When I say severe my mouth feels parched and I still feel thirsty after drinking 2 glasses water. My fasting blood glucose in the morning is however consistently in the range 4.5-5.1 mmol/l.Should I be concerned? General health, energy, appetite otherwise good.  I stopped the diet a week ago and am back on normal carbs and (slightly reduced, but normal) quantities. The thirst and dry mouth are however getting worse, the blood sugar in the morning remains around 5 mmol/l. Should I go back and bother the doctor now, or could this be a normal consequence of dieting that needs a few weeks to resolve?
