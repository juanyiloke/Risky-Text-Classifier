Girlfriend moving in with me?by ShapoopyI'm moving into a 3 bedroom house with two close friends for the next year of uni, which is cool.

Would this potentially work out or would we be liable to get into trouble with the landlord? (She wouldn't technically be living there, just there all the time and all her stuff would be there )
