Want to recover but it feels so wrongHi everyone, I am new here. I am from the UK and I'm just looking for a little guidance/reassurance I guess. I have had an eating disorder since I was around 21 (now 24), but still struggle to accept it. I will try to keep things brief, but here goes...!I started off counting calories wanting to lose weight a few years back, it got out of hand to the point where I have been counting every calorie and weighing all my food for a few years now. I am 5'4 and I have never been really underweight. Perhaps that's one reason I struggle to accept I have an eating disorderI restrict calories, and my target over the years has varied. I also exercise fairly often. But starting a new job this week and being more active has made my hunger sky rocket. I am eating more than usual but still feeling hungry.My partner thinks this is my metabolism speeding up, my body asking for nutrients to repair the damage years of restricting have done. This is hard to accept - if I had been a very underweight anorexic, I understand I could need a significant amount of calories to recover, but I'm not. I have the physical symptoms of semi starvation (cold, numb extremeties from time to time, weaker hair/nails, extreme fatigue, foggy brain etc), and I have been having night sweats since eating more. But I still can't accept it. I just feel weak, greedy, and hideously ashamed.I am being seen by the NHS eating disorder service, though there are long waiting lists. I believe this ED is what lead to my horrible bout of depression (just coming through the other side, due to the right medication). It left me self harming and suicidal, and I am scared my current low mood and lack of self worth due to food is going to lead me back there. I guess I am just desperate to know whether this ravenous hunger is actually what my body needs, or something is just going wrong in my head, I'm greedy and going to end up fat.Sorry if that was a bit of an essay :(
