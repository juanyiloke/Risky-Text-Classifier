Textbooks for Uni - When and where should you get these?by oliverollHi all! I may sound incredibly stupid for asking this question (it may have already been asked before) so please forgive me. I have accepted an offer to study Law at a central London university this September, and as I am an international student I'm not completely certain about the administrative logistics of going to Uni. I understand that for law, we will have textbooks, and recommended reading material but as I currently do not live in the UK: 1. Would it be better to buy textbooks before or after reaching the UK?2. Where I would be able to buy Law textbooks? (1st or 2nd hand) But I'm not too sure if we will only be given a comprehensive list of textbooks/recommended reading material once we have started the course. So please, slap me in the face with some reality. Thank you!
