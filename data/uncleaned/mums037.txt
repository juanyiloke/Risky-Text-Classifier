DD is 3. I have just redecorated her room. When we were talking about doing it she said she wanted it to be purple. Now, I wasn't too keen on it being very purple and didn't want overly girly wallpaper. So I've gone for a (I think!) very lovely grey wallpaper with white stars on one wall (this one http://www.gltc.co.uk/wallpaper/gltc-wallpaper-grey-star/gltc/fcp-product/10003400 ) white walls and have painted the woodwork very pale lilac. I'm planning to accessorise with a purple rug, cushions etc and have bought her an elephant duvet cover as elephants are the animal of the moment. When she saw it today (just empty room with no accessories etc, she burst into tears - "I wanted a purple bedroom!!" Now I know she's 3 and prone to emotional outbursts, but I must admit I feel a bit mean now. I mean, I think her room is lovely - very classy and understated, but I don't think she shares this subtlety! Have I been a bit of a meany?!
