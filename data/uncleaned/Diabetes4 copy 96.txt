Cholesterol Testing & Interpreting ResultsHope I'm putting this in the right section.Very interesting video published on Jimmy Moore's blog today. A talk by Dr Ken Sikaris, Pathologist at the Auckland University "Fizz Conference".He explains the importance of the Trigylcerides : HDLC Ratio and why it's the best predictor of CVD.Towards the very end he talks about how closely the A1c test tracks to both CVD and fasting insulin/hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. Apparently to be on the safe side we (at least, Type 2's and those with metabolic syndrome) should be aiming for 5.5 or below.
