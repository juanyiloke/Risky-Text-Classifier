feel like increasing pill on my owni feel like increasing my prozac from 40 mg to 60 mg on my own . the only main stress is that all my doctors and carers will disagree and tell me to wait several weeks until i see the consultant who may put it up to 50 mg. i feel like doing it making my own decision but if i did i would be feeling guilty and as though im in the wrong but ideally i would like to increase it. all the doctors will say wait. i dont think im confident enough to do it what are peoples views and opinions on this?Advice and support please :(Today I have a lot to do and I woke up feeling very shaky and a little but nauseous, tonight I'm having some friends over for Chinese food and games, even though I know I'll enjoy this I feel nothing but dread... I was recently knocked back on my progress with social anxiety after an unexpectedly bad reaction to fluoxetine, since then I've come off the medication but still haven't regained my confidence completely, please give me some advice on how to get through my day of preparations and social encounters!Exhaustion - depression and anxietyI take 40mg of Citalopram once a day and 40mg of Propranolol 3 times a day and I am constantly absolutely exhausted. Some nights I sleep, and some nights I drift in and out of horrendous nightmares. It makes no difference, whether I wake up from 10 hours sleep or 2, I am always horribly tired, with no energy to do anything whatsoever. Is there anything I can take for this? Has anybody else had the same problem? I don't know what to doÂ
