Holding Out Until Therapy StartsHelloI wanted to ask the experienced sufferer (lol) for some insight concerning surviving until therapy starts. I have severe PTSDfrom 20 years of abuse and neglect, deaths and bullying. Since I realized I had PTSD I am not coping so well, (not that I have done much better before) I feel so dimished and hurt by it and have a hard time with accepting it. I live much more in my head and in the past because I cant get it out of my head. I have suicidal thoughts from time to time, but would never do it, as my brother did it before me and I witnessed the senselessness of the act first hand.For stupid reasons, to boring and long to go into here, it will take a long time for me until therapy starts. Probably months or more.What do you think would be healthy things to focus on? One month ago I started doing excercise and focus my energy on that. I do not have alot of energy and live in isolation. The excercise I do at home, 3 times a week. It was fun to learn about it and put it into action. I already feel like I am making much progress and feel better about myself and in mysself. It is fun and fulfilling, things that are in short supply for me.Before I started I was either sitting or sleeping for months and months at a time.I have a boyfriend who helps me alot, so I am isolated but not alone.I also force myself to learn about PTSD, which is hard for me and makes me very sad, and take part in social things online, like this forum and multiplayer games. Feels like a good first step in "resocialising". I also try to live healthy and stopped smoking, and reduced my alcohol intake alot.I have an appointment with a social worker in a few weeks.Do you think I am going about this smartly? Thanks for reading and any input much appreciated.I do not feel like living right now, just surviving. Help is on its way, I think, just a little bit longer...
