  QUestion: Asthma- cats- LITTER!________________________________________Thank you all for your help! I have been managing well because of everything you guys told me and I have followed all the advice I got here. Seems to be working too. Haven't used the Proair in days! But I have a question about my cat's litter box and the type of litter to use. I think this dummy here remembered it wrong, because I went out and bought white unscented clay litter (cheap) as opposed to the usual litter I was always buying (Scoop way - expensive). I thought I read here somewhere to use clay litter...must have read it elsewheres tho I can't imagine where. Anyway...is this no frills litter that I just bought better to use than the expenisve brand name ones. I am trying to find a litter that doesn't aggarvate my asthma when I clean the litter box. This white clay litter I am using sure does kick up a cloud of dust when I clean the box. Anyone know of a better one?Thanks again, youi guys are great!!
