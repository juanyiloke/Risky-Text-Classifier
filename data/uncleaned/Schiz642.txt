ÊAm I seeing Early Signs of schizophrenia in my brother?My brother is almost 21, he has always been an intelligent person who was always up for a healthy debate challenging societal norms with alternative, but rational ways of thinking. Just recently he's gone into a extreme bout of depression (I believe from not properly grieving the death of our other brother 4 years ago). He's dropped out of college and had become withdrawn. A few months ago he described depressive symptoms but also alarmingly told me about depersonalization symptoms of not recognizing his face when he looks in the mirror or not knowing his true identity. Sometimes feeling like he's watching his life like its a movie and he's floating above watching it all happen. At this point he was scared and willing to see a therapist, but never actually went. I know all these symptoms could be many other mental illnesses, but after meeting with him today I'm concerned as he went on these radical conspiracy theorist rants about the government. He believes that our government is brainwashing us and controlling us through media and entertainment. He believes that 9/11, the newtown school shootings, and the Boston bombings were all giant ploys setup by the government. They are all fake and just the governments way to control us with fear mongering and to spread their agenda. He was so irratic, hostile, and angry. I'm used to my brothers debates but this was different. He was irrationally passionate and my mother has disclosed that as the last few months it's all he talks about and is completely obsessed. He hasn't made any claims of auditory or visual hallucinations but I'm curious if all this is a precursor to something more serious.I suffer from GAD and am now in an anxiety attack of worries about him. I know no one can diagnose but I'm curious of people's opinions on what I've described. I know he's not healthy, but I also don't know if I'm catastrophizing his symptoms to worst case scenario.
