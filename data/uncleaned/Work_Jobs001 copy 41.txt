I suspect employee abused sick leave.________________________________________Last summer, one of the employees under my supervision (we work in retail and and annual leave requests strictly have to revolve around certain months of year) requested 2 and a half weeks off to go to Australia in mid-February. I told her I couldnt approve that much as we have a massive account active all of February and we need all hands on deck, she knew this as she is there 6 years now and is well aware of our busy times. She said how about 2 weeks as an exception and I asked the manager of the store for his approval and he said yes but only as a once off. As you can probably guess, she took her 2 weeks and then another week "sick", so she was off for 3 weeks in total. When she came back I invited her for a back to work following sickness interview as in standard for our company. When I asked her for a cert to back up her "migraine" complaint, she said that she was so sick that she didnt make it to the doctors and had nothing to show me, I asked her did she not ring a CareDoc and she got very defensive with me, raising her voice saying "I didnt even think of that, why are you getting on to me so much", I reminded her that sick pay was only if certain conditions are met and she just shrugged and said "Take it out of my holidays". Can I bring a disciplinary case against her for this? Im unsure as I have never faced this situation before. Im pretty sure the boss would back me up but I feel as if all trust is lost now, anyone got any advice?
