Too much Abilify?by Just_a_Zombie » Thu Feb 19, 2015 11:53 amHey there, I've been on Abilify (aripiprazole) for a while now. I'm on the highest recommended dose (30mg) daily, but I've been having non-stop anxiety.. both with physical and mental symptoms.The Abilify is doing its job (mostly) regarding the psychotic symptoms but I'm afraid that it's the cause of my high-strung days and nights. Has anyone else experienced an increase of anxiety on this medication? Is it worth asking my doctor to switch to another one? I've been on ziprasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine all at different times, but they all had bad side effects. what else is there left to try? I'm already overweight, and I've known two people on Olanzepine that gained a tremendous amount of weight.. I don't think I want to try that one. But I feel like I've run into a dead-end.Any help or insight is appreciated. Thanks!
