Have you ever brought food where you weren't supposed to?My husband and I go to a monthly antique fair. There is absolutely *nothing* I can eat there, so I bring my own snacks every month. We always buy a tea or coffee, then I eat what I brought in the cafeteria. Yesterday I saw someone (who worked there) looking at me while I nibbled my cheese and nuts. I wondered if she was going to say something to me, but she turned away. If she did, I was simply going to tell her that I am diabetic and that I cannot eat what they serve (stuffed potatoes, sandwiches, chips, crisps, quiche, pies and chocolate bars). An no, I'm not paying 4 quid for a sandwich simply to eat the *one* piece of meat on it!). The fact that we pay 9 quid to get in and 6 quid for two coffees, I think I can eat my cheese in peace (and I have so far).So that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  Do you ever sneak food into places because they simply have nothing you can eat?
