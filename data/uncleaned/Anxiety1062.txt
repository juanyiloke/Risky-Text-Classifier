Celebrating a VictoryThe year 2014 was horrible for me. I was diagnosed with GAD, depression, possible autism spectrum disorder, possible ADD. I am underemployed.ÊI recently went to a job fair and it went really well. I drove there by myself, which is a huge victory because of my phobia of driving. I was really able to be myself when talking to employers, I stopped trying to be a perfectionist and scrutinize every little thing I did, and I think as a result I came off a lot more relaxed and confident.So this was not only a really good exposure therapy session, but it also was the culmination of a harsh 2014. I made so much progress with baby steps, and finally my confidence has been built and I feel ready to move on to the next phase of my life.I have a tendency to ignore my victories and obsess over my failures, so I am going to try to celebrate this victory. I deserve it.
