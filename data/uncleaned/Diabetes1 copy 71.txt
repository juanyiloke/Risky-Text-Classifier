How do you tell your family you have diabetes?I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was just a kid, so I didn't have to tell my mother I had diabetes -- she was there when the doctor diagnosed me. And when we got home, she told my father. And she also told my grandparents and my teachers. I never had to worry about breaking it to anyone except my boyfriend and that wasn't so hard because at the time, "we" were still new and no one invested anything in the relationship so it wasn't one of those emotional things. But, my best friend is a grown woman with a husband and children of her own -- she's finding it hard talking to them about it. She told her husband, but he had some inkling because he recognized the symptoms (his mother is diabetic). But, she says she doesn't feel comfortable talking to him about it because she feels he won't see her the same way, anymore. She feels like she's a burden on him and not the strong woman he could always depend on when they first got married. She still hasn't told her kids yet, or her parents. Since I personally never had to go through it myself, I was hoping someone here might help. Anyone else go through a similar thing? (Oh, and I told her to sign up, but she says she's "not ready to be a diabetic yet." I think she feels that by registering on a diabetes forum, it makes it "official." Might sound silly, but I know where she's coming from. I know in time she'll come around and will kick herself for not doing this sooner. For now, I'll ask the questions for her -- if she has questions or concerns I can't help with -- and show them all to her when she's ready. Thanks for your help! It means a lot!)
