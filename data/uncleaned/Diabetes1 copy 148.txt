testingjust had a 14 day run of testing with the codefree meter and keeping a sort of food diary not counting carbs or any thing, just what i eat and drink throught the day and testing before and after meals sort of puts a new light on it for me.going to do it for a complete month to what gives me high readings then go from there. readings are all a foreing language at the moment but im figuring out stuff that makes it go higher in my own fashion it will all come with time one thing is my love affair with the sandwich has to come to an end. and another bonous is no side effects from taking actos at all, were as metformin was a nightmarewhat i have noticed is around lunch time i get a bit of sicky feeling till i get somthing to eat wierd never had that before most days i used to skip lunch oh well it will work its self outRiff
