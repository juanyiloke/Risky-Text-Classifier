ÊAnorexia breakdown, please helpI am 23 and for the past year I have been battling with anorexia. In the last 2 months or so it's gotten really bad and I have become totally obsessed. I only eat very little during the day and then a salad or something for dinner. If I can't make it to the gym I freak out to the point where I feel sick with anxiety. I have become sneaky with my food and lie to my family and friends about how much I've eaten. I have always been slim but people around me are getting increasingly concerned about my drastic weight loss, and are encouraging me to put on more.ÊI've just gotten so used to this way of living, I can't imagine going back to a "normal" life. It's not even about losing any more weight, and this is what I find hard to explain. I know I'm skinny, I am not stupid, I can feel the bones. I've just gotten so used to controlling my food, that it seems completely ridiculous to even contemplate eating 3 meals a day, complete with CARBS. I only allow myself breakfast once a week, so I struggle to imagine having it 7 times!! And the worry is that if I start doing that, no doubt I will put on weight, and that is something I am not ready to do.ÊLast night and binge ate (I never normally do this and am still in shock by it). I ate anything and everything, to the point where I couldn't move from my bed - both frozen in disgust and because i was physically in so much pain from my bloated stomach. I know this isn't normal behaviour and has made me realise how completely unhealthy my relationship with food has become.I have no idea why I am posting here but I just need some help/advice.Please help, I feel really alone. :'(
