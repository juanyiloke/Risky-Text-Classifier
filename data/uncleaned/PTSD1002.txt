My name is Patti. A few years ago I lived in a dangerous area. While sleeping one night a bullet was fired into my home missing my head by three feet. Two years ago while resting at home I heard sudden and rapid gun fire. It turned out to be a shoot out. The main shooter shot from a porch twenty feet above my bedroom. The next morning, without warning I basically stopped living. Did not want to eat or anything. I began having nightmares, day area, flashbacks and sensitivity to sudden and loud noises. I am in therapy and am learning coping skills. Does anyone ever recover? I mean a couple of batteries fell onto my hardwood floor once and I doubled over crying. It felt like I was being shot. It's not like I think my way into the reactions. They just happen.
