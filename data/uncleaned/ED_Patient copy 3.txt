Severe hair thinning after RecoverySo I'm now 18, female and fully weight restored after struggling with disordered eating and restricting and exercise addiction. After my mother passing away at the end of 2011 I began to lose weight, initially from stress and trauma but then on purpose as a way of coping, I would eat about 700 calories per day give or take and exercise as much as I could. I'm 5ft 7 and dropped to to 7 1/2 stone down from just over 11, my lowest weight occurred exactly one year ago, since then (So December 2012 onwards) I decided by myself that I wanted to recover and I saw a doctor who told me I needed to gain weight as I had lost my menstrual cycle and was underweight... I didn't see any eating disorder professionals though. I did see a dietitian who helped me with meal and snack ideas and told me how much I really needed to be eating, so I ate the nourishing diet, and still am! I eat really healthy and balanced and now have a healthy bmi of 20 and exercise in moderation BUT 12 months later my hair is still thinning like CRAZY! It's making me feel so down and now want to leave the house, I hardly have any hair left...I'm considering getting a wig. I never go out without a hat. I've had blood tests and my diet isn't deficient in anything, I'm not stressed about anything EXCEPT THE HAIR, my thyroid and liver have been checked and are fine too and my menstrual cycle returned this summer as well. Will it ever stop falling out and thicken up? I take vitamins B complex, Iron, Calcium + vitamin D too. I'm an 18 year old girl, I just need my hair!
