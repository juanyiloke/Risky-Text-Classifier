Jasper Carrott  If you didn’t see Jasper Carrott last night on BBC1 you may want to get over to the iplayer and have a quick peek. I know this chap's not to everyone's taste but it gave my cheeks muscles some exercise. Most of its to do with “us lot” the elderly. I particularly liked the sketch with his daughter with the old and young in juxster position.
