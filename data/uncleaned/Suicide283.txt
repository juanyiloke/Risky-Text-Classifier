when you can't break freeI've struggled with depression and bipolar all of my life. I have had several suicide attempts when I was much younger, and All have failed so far, obviously. I can't seem to feel better, ever. I try every day to tell myself that things are going to get easier, or better, or I'll make it and be happy, but I don't think that's true anymore. I hate myself. I am a culmination of fuckups. The past seven years I have triedto improve, and then, one day, I wake up and realize that my whole life has been lying to myself tthat I'll one day be okay. I'llnever be okay.Normally iI can survive. But I really did it now. I quit my job and moved out of my apartment six months ago to travel with a friend. He took five months to sell his house. Now I am out of money and homeleas and haven't traveled and have nowhere to go. I just want to die. I want to go back home, but I don'thave a home. I ddon'thave money. I ddon't know how to get back on my feet. I'm scared. And my depression set in again, and now I'mstuck. II'm staying with friends, but I know I'min the way, and iI'm sick, and tired, and tired of life. I just want to wander off quietly and die without being an inconvenience to anyone. I'm tired of trying. Life takes so much effort. Living and being happy and keeping up appearences. I don't want to do it anymore. It's been fifteen years or more, since before Iwas in my double ddigits, since I was happy. I'm just tired. I want it to be done. I want to just go to sleep and never wake up. I hate existing so much.
