 Bath or Manchester?by HMontyI'm really torn between the University of Bath and the University of Manchester. I have an offer from Bath to study Politics and International Relations, and an offer from Manchester to study International Management with American Business. While I hate A-Level Business Studies with a passion, I actually think the course at Manchester looks really interesting and it has a year out studying at a University in North America. I visited Manchester, and I really liked it; especially the city feel, and I as someone who enjoys theatre, the two theatres are a bonus!I visited Bath also, and it obviously had a completely different feel, I even sensed a difference in the class of students, which I'm vary about. I am from Northern Ireland and currently attend a Grammar School, but it seemed a lot of people at Bath were from private schools in England and I don't know how well I'd fit in. However, I loved Bath itself, it's obviously a lot smaller than Manchester, but it was beautiful, and as someone with an interest in Classics, it seems like a great place to be. The course also looks interesting as I like Politics, but I'm worried that I will struggle, I recently read an article which said that while Oxford had been making its degrees easier, degrees from Bath are now harder to obtain. The course asks for 3 A's and that is what I'm predicted, but I feel I may not even be capable of that. Manchester is asking for AAB. Writing this I feel as though I appear to be leaning more towards Manchester, but I am conscious of Bath's reputation and if I do go into Politics perhaps Bath would be better for networking.The UCAS deadline is May 7th, so I am running out of time. Does anyone go to either of these Universities and could give me any advice or guidance? Thanks.
