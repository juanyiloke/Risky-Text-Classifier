GP`sNot sure if this is the correct place to post this but here goes. GP`s come in for a fair bit of stick on this forum and, in many cases, deservedly so! but I thought It would be interesting to redress the balance a little by telling you about my GP. When I was diagnosed T2 about 10yrs ago he was extremely supportive and encouraged me to educate myself about the condition as much as possible. Back then the usual advice was simply to give up sugar and eat plenty of carbs, but my doc told me even then that I should avoid pasta and potatoes and eat complex carbs, if I must have bread make it wholegrain and above all try to lose weight. I discovered lchf on this forum (for which many thanks!) and have lost 2 stones, as a result of this his advice was, " well done and keep on doing what you are doing" and he took me off one of my meds. He is always happy to give me strips on prescription and I have never felt the need to see a consultant or dietician. When I read some of the stories on here about some of the GP`s out there I feel very sorry for some of you, and very thankful that I seem to have a good `un. Don`t get me started on pharmacists though!!
