part time work issues.________________________________________So last Oct I started looking for work. Part time. I was working full time waitress and opposite shifts to my husband. So had decided that I'd look for part time day job more suitable to his shifts. So got a job was told be 18 hours per week. The girl who left was full time nd current part timer moved to full time so the part timer was covering 2 days a week so getting 18 hours. For Nov nd Dec I worked 18 hours over course of 4 days which suited as done some waitressing during busy xmas. Since Jan iv been getting 9-13 hours a week apart from 1 week where girl git married nd i done 40 hour week on my own with no lunch break. I'm still doing 1 shift a week in old job to keep money coming in. I'm 14 weeks pregnant. Am I better off getting on with it until baby due. Doubt I'm entitled to much hubby has great wagesI keep asking for contract but not getting anywhere. I feel like they are well able to use me like working 19 hours for few weeks then down to 9 then 2 weeks at 25 den a week at 40 hours. Anyone have any advise. I do really like the job it's retail.
