Really neglected a friend, token apology gift?Okay so the story is that over the Christmas break, I really should have been in contact with a friend but for selfish reasons I wasn't. Unbeknownst to me, someone very close to her died over Christmas. Feeling dreadful about it and would like to give her something small to say I'm sorry about her loss and sorry I wasn't there for her.ÊUnfortunately I'm drawing a total blank on what to get her! Any suggestions ladies?
