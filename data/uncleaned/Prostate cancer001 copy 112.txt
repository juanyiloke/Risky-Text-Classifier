Nearly at the end of my time on AbirateroneHi all,it's been a long time since I  .  Well, 26 months down the road and my time on Abby tabs as part of the Stampede trial finishes next week.  I'm approaching it with mixed feelings, I won't miss the side effects of both the Abby tabs and the Predinolone, it'll be a relief not to have to take an additional 5 pills every day and, hopefully, some of my lethargy and muscle aches will disappear.  Hopefully my digestive system will return to near normal, as far as the lasting effects of radiotherapy over a year ago allow.But, it's been worth it and I'm so glad I've been participating.  I would go through it again.So, only another 12 months of Prostate and then it's watchful waiting.Best wishes, Eric
