ÊComplex ptsd / bpdI'm not entirely sure what to write here. I suppose this is more of a 'musing' thread..The diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder was slapped on me when I was 20.ÊPrevious to then, the CAMHS team said I had 'Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features'.While there is no talk of giving me this as a formal/new diagnosis, my therapist has mentioned that I seem to meet the criteria for Complex PTSD. I've done a bit of research and it says that BPD and PTSD (or complex ptsd) are indeed very similar.So how does someone distinguish between the two?Anyway, I feel that this completely fits into place. All of it. Particularly the fact that when I got my BPD diagnosis, I was actually well in the thick of the abusive situation. A lot of my "BPD symptoms" were a result of desperately seeking a rescuer from the shit I was in. Since escaping the situation, those symptoms have calmed down. I had a very brief period of exhibiting BPD-type behaviour, but that was during a time in which I was seeing a man who, I didn't realise at the time and can only see it now, was very emotionally abusive and controlling.I don't know.The reason i've taken to making a post is I realise just how much I get flashbacks of things (which i've never really spoken about), and just how much of the rest of the time i'm absolutely numb and remember very little.And by acknowledging that fact, I started to spiral a bit about a really traumatic night I had during the time in the abusive situation... so I suppose this is a bit of a distraction from that.ÊIf anyone can relate then it would be interesting for me to know. Thanks for reading. x
