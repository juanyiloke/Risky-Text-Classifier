I'm so angryI just need to vent.I've been having such a hard time with anger. I'm always upset and I just want to scream. I've been struggling lately. Last night I just lost it and I started sobbing while on a drive with a friend. This morning I woke up in a horrible mood wanting to snap everyone's heads off. Now I'm depressed and I want to cut until every drop of blood is gone.ÊI'm finally feeling the anger and sadness for where I was abused.
