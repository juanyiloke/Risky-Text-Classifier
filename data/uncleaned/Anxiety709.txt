Zopiclone WithdrawalHi thereThought I'd start a new thread specifically in regard to zopiclone. I've been on it 5 weeks and want to come off it (I don't know how I'll sleep but too scared to carry on!).ÊI take up to 3.75mg at night, sometimes less.ÊHave been reading about the addiction and know the longer I'm on it the worse it will be to come off so any advice would be greatly appreciated please! I'm seeing the doctor soon but would be very interesred in your personal experience please!ÊAlso taking 50mg trazodone which doesn't help me sleep but as someone pointed out it might do without the zop!ÊThanks xxDon't understand this!Can anyone help me? I'm feeling so troubled now.Ê8 weeks ago I stopped sleeping. Hadn't realised there was anything wrong although I guess there had been some anxiety around since an operation I had last year which led to complications.ÊI'm taking trazodone 50mg at night to help me sleep. It has sent my anxiety through the roof but seemed to get better. Now I'm starting to feel quite down. I still don't sleep well and I guess that's taking its toll.ÊI hate taking medication but I fear now that if I stop the trazodone I won't sleep at all!ÊAny advice please? This is all quite new and scary for me!!
