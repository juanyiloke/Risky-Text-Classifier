Grocery billsI have been looking back over our grocery bills for the last few months and although I had not really noticed it in the weekly bills, I had expected to find some drop in costs because the euro (where much of our food originates) has dropped by 20% against the GBP and oil has dropped  by 50%.  Yet I find no discernible reduction in food bills.  Our weekly costs should have reduced by somewhere around 15% but on average our costs have risen by 1% (within the margin for error as we do not buy the same stuff every week), so where have all the cost reductions gone?
