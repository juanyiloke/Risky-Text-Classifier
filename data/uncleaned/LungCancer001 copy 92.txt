Solitary Lung NoduleAfter pneumonia seven years ago, I had a 6mm ground glass nodule in the lung, along with two other 2mm nodules. Recently after a scan for another reason, I had an 11mm non-calcified lung nodule with ill-defined margins in exactly the same area as the 6mm nodule in the lower right lobe, superior segment. Same wording on both scans. I know ground glass nodules can grow very slowly, and are usually malignant when they do. I am not able to see my pulmonologist until the end of next month. I am extremely worried. Has anyone else had this type of nodule that grew?
