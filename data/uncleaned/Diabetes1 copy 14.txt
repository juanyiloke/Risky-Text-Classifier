Poll results discussed at Hounslow meeting.I sent the poll results for these poll results to the local administrator. and He printed them for issue to the meeting last night, & asked me to talk about them.I did this as there was no speaker arranged, & the report of the previous meeting was:Several folk on statins had muscle problems, but were unaware that that was a common side effect. When I had my chol side effects 10 years ago, & stopped taking them, my Dr immediately confirmed the side effect & advised me not to take them. The pharmacist said they did not warn people of the likely side effects because people would look out for them. Not everyone can read the warning leaflet & understand it. So many suffer, unaware of the established dangers. The organisers introduced me, as one who had taken control by a revolutionary diet contrary to NHS recommendations. I could have sold several of Trudi Deakin's books - they took note of the web site.
