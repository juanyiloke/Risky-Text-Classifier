That awful nausea!¥	Hi all, I just wondered about how effective anti sickness melds have been ? I am about to do 3rd FEC, and took Ondansetron, along with a steroid, for the first 5 days after chemo. I still felt pretty nauseous, though was only sick once, and I began to wonder how much good they were doing, and if it is worth trying a different drug, just to see? Or maybe it is better just to accept that there will be horrible feelings for the first week or so after? ¥	Would love to hear from others who have maybe had more success with melds? Thank you !
