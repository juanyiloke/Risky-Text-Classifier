ÊHIMy user name is Liz1965 and I am new here. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I am 50 years. I still have a rough time with my illness and I have been in the DBT group before, and I think I need to start doing my skills again. My therapist know some of the skills and I know that I will need help with them, my problems is that I forget the skills when I need them the most. Sorry for going on, just nervous. I also have a Learning disability, PSTD and OCD. I just wanted to say hi and glad to be here. thanks
