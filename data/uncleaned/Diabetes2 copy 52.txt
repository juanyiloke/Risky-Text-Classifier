I hate type 1 diabetes. How can I get motivated to want to control my health  9  I hate type 1 diabetes. Absolutely hate it! I am 17 and have had it for 6 years. It basically ruins my life. No one understand my struggle (apart from my family, sort of). People think diabetes is a joke and not serious. I can't be what I have wanted to work as since a child because of my diabetes and I cry my self to sleep every night because I'm so scared of dying young because of my diabetes. In terrified. Dispite  all of this worry and concern I cannot motivate my self to do regular bgls, I'm always running high and I hate the though of what it's doing to my health. But I can't motivate my self to change it
