Regarding test strips and choice of meterHi all, hope everyone is well.I have to meet with my GP practice manager tomorrow and just wanted some back up advice if at all possible.Basically out of the blue I have been sent a new monitor, through the post. The GP practice now refuses to prescribe test strips for my old monitor. From what I can see this new monitor isn't being sent out because it's "better" or "updated" in any way, it's a matter of cost, and from what I read up... they(a) shouldn't just alter the monitor I'm using without consultation with me and(b) this particular monitor should just be used with type 2 without complications, not T2's on insulin.At the moment I'm refusing to change, but I'm rapidly running out of test strips. Anyone know the legal standpoint on this or any other information I can use when I meet with the manager. The new monitor they sent out is Gluco RX Nexus. My old one is a one touch ultra. I did a few readings this morning, the readings I got from my old meter were 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2. The new meter 5.4, 4.1 and 5.7. Same drop of blood, same site. I know that's within their 20% allowance, but really, I'm not happy with that kind of difference.TIA
