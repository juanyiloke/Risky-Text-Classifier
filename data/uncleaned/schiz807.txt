For years, I have felt constantly watched no matter what. It affects the way I live my life and the way I do everything. I feel they are judging me, making fun of me. I can't get dressed without covering myself up fast. Sometimes I refuse to bathe. I hear their voices and I hear them talking. Sometimes I experience some laugh attacks, and really only then do I see them. I've tried to tell someone about it, but they act like it doesn't matter and push it under the rug. It makes me so scared and so paranoid. I always try to look my best, even going to bed, because I'm afraid what they'll say. I've been bullied my whole life, and maybe that has something to do with this. I just can't take it anymore. No one really even cares about it and they act like it's not a big deal. I'm afraid of whatever is talking to me and Ineed help. Does this sound like any kind of disorder or anything that I should propose to a doctor?
