How I Deal With Depression.I didn't really know where to stick this but I wanted to just list the things that I do to try and cheer myself up, and find out what other people do. I don't know how other people think of depression but for me it's like having a giant slug sitting on my brain sucking up all the happiness from experiences before I can benefit with them. Most days when it flares up badly it's difficult to cheer myself up so I just really wanted to see what other people did I guess. I write a blog, which I have found incredible useful. I blogged for the first time about depression today and it made me feel better as I was having a tough week, that is what made me want to sign up on here. If anybody wants to read it, the link is here http://glennasaurus-...blogspot.co.uk/. I know it sounds lame but going outside always cheers me up on my worst days. When I have a flare up I always want to shut myself off from the world and it can be quite difficult but if I do force myself to go outside eventually it will make me feel better. Playing with pets is another thing that always cheers me up. When I'm at my worst I find dealing with people, even people I love, to be frustrating. It can be hard to make people understand what you are going through. Having a pet gives me someone to talk to that I don't really expect anything from but I enjoy the company. What do you guys do to make yourself feel better when you have flare ups?
