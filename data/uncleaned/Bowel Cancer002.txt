scared and angryHi, im mike, im 48 and always been fit and healthy, been in and out of my local doctors for 18months (ish) and just been told i had piles, take some laxatives and use cream, 4 weeks ago i demanded something needed to be done, last monday was told i had cancer, the only treatment being removal of my back passage which they will not be able to connect again so i will have a bag for life! havent had much more info than this with regards to chemo etc hoping to hear this week at some point, i just cant believe its happening, so scared.
