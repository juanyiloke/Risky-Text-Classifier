ÊMaxing out on risperidone Consta Can't trust the NHSI have max'd out the dosage on my consta depot and the added 20mg of olanzapine is not working either. I spoke to my pdoc and she thinks I will get better results from haldol. I am worried about using an older med but anything is better than what I am going through at the moment. Constant voices bickering between themselves working out my level of pain they are going to cause me if I do not comply with their request. I also do not trust the NHS they have been tricking me for months by changing meds giving me placebos so that they can experiment with my mind.Dont know if I am paranoid or just hyper vigilant
