Coud this be Cancer again? So worriedI had Lung Cancer 3 years agao 4 ribs removed (not that it was in all 4 but surgeon wanted to be cautious) Been clear ever since. Unfortunately the last 3 weeks have been a little unsettling for me. I wretched my back sneezing and I am not sure if the pain I had was there before this in the ribs it certainly hurt really bad afterwards. Anyhow this pain did not go away so I checked in at the ER who gave me an X-Ray and said everything was okay and no change from previous X-Rays. Anyhow, I then experienced chest pains accompanied by the back pain so I checked in again at the ER who on Friday last 19 June gave me an X-Ray and said no recurrence of anything and nothing suspicious seen. They wanted to do a Thoracic CT just in case which they did and they said no recurrence or anything suspicious. I was due my bone scan which I attended this Monday just gone and Dr called me to say that a couple of posterior right ribs are changed since my last bone scan 2 years ago, they put on the report this could either be possible recurrence, osteoarthritis or post op changes.(I didn't think it could be that as it was 3 years since the operation). So Dr then said maybe we should get another x-ray of ribs but this was before she realised I had an X Ray as well as CT last Friday 19 June, 2 days before bone scan. She said that it's up to me what I want to do, she was saying maybe not to bother or then maybe to go for x-ray in a month? She doesn't feel that it is recurrence because CT and X rays were all clear. I have tumour markers done periodically and no change in those.Sorry to ramble here, it is a lot to ask of you but I would appreciate any advice/thoughts on everything.Thanks Maddy
