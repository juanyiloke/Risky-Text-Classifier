Help feel so alone!Posted 2 months agoHi, can anyone listen to me and help me feel any better? I've never felt so bad! I was diagnosed by a so called cbt therapist with ptsd weeks ago, I have sadly just had to pull out of my treatment due to the powers that be thinking I'd be better off not treated by them! I was MEANT to be treated for this due to an attempted rape when I was 19, which someone clearly sees as a joke! Can anyone advise me where I go next as this daft therapist has opened up my feelings then left them up in the air! I now feel lost this henious crime needs crushing in my mind but I now feel I have nowhere to turn as this is impacting on my marriage too, I just feel alone, please help I'm so sad and upset!
