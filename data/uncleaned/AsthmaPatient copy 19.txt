Struggling to breath but no history of asthma. Is this the beginning?  3  Hello everybody,I am a 33 year old woman and I have had a chest infection for 2 weeks, on antibiotics...My breathing was a little troublesome, which was normal for a chest infection, but over the last couple of days my breathing has become so very difficult I have been to casualty twice...If I sit still and don't move or talk I am fine, but if I walk across the room, or try to have a conversation is such very hard hard work, I have to sit down panting away with my heart racing until I can catch my breath.  I was prescribed a Salbutamol inhaler which helps but only for a very short time, I am exceeding 30 puffs a day which is making me feel wooozzzy.  I was given 40mg of Prednisolone this morning and was wondering how long it takes to kick in??  I can't face another sleepness night wondering if I should call and ambulance or struggle on for a bit longer...Is this the start of a lifetime of asthma for me, as it seems like a curse.  I do not smoke and i am slightly overweight.  The breathing is difficult blowing out as opposed to breathing in, like it is stuck in my lower throat.  My SATS were fine in hospital 95% o2 so wasn't having an 'attack' but it is so new to me.  Is it possible to have asthma temporarily?? Please help!
