ÊFeeling fed upHi, I'm new to the forum and I really need help with my eating disorder. I didn't want to admit I had one but after seeing myself in the mirror recently, I can't deny how much weight I've lost.ÊI'm anorexic but I do sometimes [moderated] when I feel as though I've eaten too much. For example, this morning all I had was hot chocolate and immediately [moderated]. I didn't even finish the whole cup, only half. It felt awful and Ive only eaten a tiny bit since then and I'm full.ÊI'm lucky to eat a meal a day, it's so horrible to be this way. People at work notice I rarely eat and I feel like people might judge me even though they're lovely people.ÊI just want to be able to be healthy and eat properly and not be stick-thin. I know this is due to being called "fat" in the past but I'm not overweight, I've never been and I've always eaten loads. I have a very fast metabolism but still I feel full all the time now.My fiance and I have been trying for a baby but an eating disorder prevents that from happening, not to mention it would be harmful for the baby if I didn't eat much during the pregnancy. I'm scared I'll never get over this eating disorder and I'll never be healthy and have a baby. The thought kills me. I try SO hard to overcome this eating disorder and my fiance helps me too but it's too hard. I feel so helpless.Does anyone have any advice on where to even start with overcoming this? I only admitted to having this order a few weeks ago but I'm not sure where to start with getting help or anything. My fiance says going to the doctor might be my best solution but would that be a good idea? I'm not quite sure how they would help exactly, I know they'd try their best but in all seriousness, what can doctors do to help this? It seems impossible to overcome even with the help of others.ÊI'm sorry I sound so pessimistic, I just hate this feeling so much, I hate feeling helpless and scared.Ê
