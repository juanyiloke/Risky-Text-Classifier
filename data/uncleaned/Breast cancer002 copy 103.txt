Marker clip and chemo?¥	Hello ladies!¥	Here we go again me with my questions!¥	my mum starts her chemo FEC-T on Wednesday. However, we just received a phone call from the breast clinic telling us my mum needs the marker clip (chip) inserted into her lump... Tomorrow?!!! I asked the lady if that's okay considering she starts chemo the next day and that she'll be on steroids and she said it should be ok but she isn't sure and we need to ask oncology. So I tried phoning my oncology nurse but I think she went home so I phoned the oncology dept. they also had no idea and I think I spoke to 3 nurses and they said they're not sure but to call my mums onco nurse tomorrow! We dont want to go all the way to the hospital if it's something they can't do? Like surely it won't heal properly if she's on chemo? Or am I being dumb? I will deffo call my mums onco nurse tomorrow morning to make sure but it's a bit confusing! ¥	another q: what can my mum eat on the day of chemo? It stars at 2pm. We're stillconfused to what she can or cannot eat.¥	Thanks and sorry for the Q!!!
