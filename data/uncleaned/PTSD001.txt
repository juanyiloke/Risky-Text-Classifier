Feel Rabid When Married Men Come Onto Me...I need to talk about this...Do other women feel LIVID and outraged and so offended when a married man comes onto them, knowing that they want sex?I had a verbal exchange with a man the other day. He has a wife and children. A brief conversation and from what he said it was clear he wanted to cheat on his wife with me. The pig. Kids at home too.I didn't say much because I didn't feel safe... But over the years whenever a married man tries to hit on me I am RAGEFUL inside, while others will LAUGH when I tell them that this has just happened to me, or they say take it as a compliment and I should be flattered.I think I've just figured out why. I take marriage very seriously. If you need to cheat, why stay married? That's my point of view.But I think I've just figured out why I get enraged. It's because I don't want to be mistaken with my mother who was basically a whore more or less, had no morals. To be even remotely be compared to her makes me rage. For anyone to think that I'm 'that kind of woman' enrages me because I equate it with 'her' and I am BEYOND insulted. Plus I think of the wife sitting at home with his kids being betrayed by the pig which enrages me.... And I think of the kids with a pig for a father...It's been over a week since this excuse of a husband came onto me and I'm still so angry... What's my deal? Religion, sanctity of marriage and mommy-dearest... but I'm still so angry a week later...I guess too, that I'm afraid he'll come back and try again.Livid for being disrespected?Maybe I'm livid as well because I didn't say how I felt because I didn't feel safe enough to tell him off...
