ÊCrisis to hopeHello. I am on here to connect with people and to give and receive support from people who are dealing with similar situations. I was in foster care and I want to use my past experiences to help others who are dealing with similar things that I dealt with. I made my first YouTube video yesterday. Feel free to check it out.Êhttps://youtu.be/lR_YgAAn70s. Also, I am writing an autobiography. Not sure if I am going to get it published though, not the best writer, let alone an author. If you would like to connect, I would really like that. Feel free to pm and/or friend me. I look forward to getting to know you!
