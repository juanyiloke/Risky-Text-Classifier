Anyone else who can relate? I am new to the forum. I have had several people close to me die in a short amount of time. (Six.) Hence- PTSD. The VERY worst is the hypervigilance which I think is ruining my life, and just won't let go. I cannot let my guard down. I have not 'relaxed' for years. I cannot. The deaths, but also I literally cannot remember the 1st 10 years of my childhood which was too stressful. Heard stories about it, but can't remember. Anyone else's nerves (and life) gone to pieces from too many deaths? Also- have thought about s. since the last death a handful of years ago. Do other people have this? (There is no support group in the city I live in.) Would like to know if anyone else is suffering from the same, or close to it. I cannot seem to get a grip on life anymore.
