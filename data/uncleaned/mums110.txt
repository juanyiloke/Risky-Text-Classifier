DD is 5 1/2 months, after weeks and weeks of excessive drooling we finally saw the tips of her first teeth coming through on Weds. 'Yay!' we thought... then the screaming started. She's abandoned sleeping for the time being and is instead screaming the house down. Over the last few days we've tried bonjela, Ashton & Parsons, Chamomilla, Calpol and lots and lots of cuddles but little seems to console her. Very upsetting all round .Is this par for the course and if so how long does it usually last?
