ÊHelp pleaseHey guys,I honestly don't know what to do. I have been feeling extremely down with suicidal ideation and a strong urge to harm myself. I am taking sertraline 150mg's but I still feel like shit! I'm also having counselling.I don't know what else I can possibly do. I'm trying to proactive and not just dwell. But nothing seems to be working. I don't know how longer I can go on like this.I don't really want to go back to my GP because they will just up my sertraline to 200mg's and its already effecting my memory. Making me clumsy, forgetful and slow.
