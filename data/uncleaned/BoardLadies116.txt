Selling an angagement ringHas anyone done it? I am wondering if there is much of a market for second hand engagement rings and if so who / where would I go to in order to sell it?I have mine at home and figure its a waste to have it just sitting there so I am going to bring it to a jeweller to get it cleaned and valued. Just not sure what to do with it after that or how much it would fetch.ÊI know the stones are decent and I could always have them reset as a different piece of jewellery but to be honest i;d rather get rid and spend the money on something that doesn't remind me of my ex.
