Anythings possible?¥	Hi ladies I need help! Maybe for my own peace of mind but even how I could tell my mum. She's in hospital due to low white blood cells due to chemo the Doxcetal. She had her CT scan just 3 weeks ago and all came back clear! However because she had a cough shortly just before chemo that turned into a chest infection. However, the doctors like to talk loud outside my mums room when they do consultation. I don't know if I heard right but at the time they were informed about the ct scan, they seemed to say maybe the Cancer has spread to her lung, but when I asked the doc she was like we don't know we can't compare it because she hasn't had any scans done. I was like but she did just 3 weeks ago a whole body ct scan and it was wall clear, safe and sound. So she was like oh ok that's fine and walked out. I feel maybe they're trying to avoid the subject? The xray did reveal a small chest infection in her right lung and she sounds much better than yesterday the doctor said. Is it better if I speak to our oncology doc? They also didn't seem to agree with my mums onco doc that she decided to give my mum the White cell jab yesterday. They were also saying it's unusual for someone to be on chemo like my mum and get an infection? I appriciate the emergency doctors but I feel like the onco Doctor seems more informative. Maybe I'm worrying myself to nothing but with Cancer anything is possible. Have any of you ladies had an experience like this?
