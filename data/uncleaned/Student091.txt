Will transferring for second year affect my loan?by xtinalouiseI started Leeds Met in September 2012, but shortly dropped out, however I had a full years worth of student loan.I then started fresh and came to University of Salford in September 2014. My entitlement to student finance said that they would cover me for the full three years of tuition, however I knew this was my last University they would cover me for, having a previous year of loan and study already.But as I'm now approaching the end of first year, I'm wanting to know if SLC will change their entitlement for me if I was to transfer to a different university for second year?
