anorexic to morbidly obeseHey,Two years ago I started to recover from my eating disorder. I started out bulimic but it quickly turned to anorexia for years. I didn't really want to get better but I did through a mental health team and dieticians. Ever since, I've been eating three meals a day with the once a week treat of a chocolate bar or pudding. (Makes me cringe to write that.)Porridge in the morning (sometimes with chopped banana like they told me to)Cheese and apple wholemeal sandwich or a small bowl of homemade soup for lunchDinner could be anything from chilli with rice or a vegetable stew ( I'm vegetarian) I'd say it was a fair portion, not a pigs plate!In the two years I have morphed into a blob monster going from size 6 hanging off me my hips to a size 14. My leg won't even fit in a skirt I used to wear!I'm good at following diets and very strict. But somehow I've gained all this weight?!! It's seriously making me consider suicide, I'm vulnerable as it is with my mental health so poor. If I got to this weight in two years where will I end up in a few years? It's making me panic.I must admit I do not exercise anymore, I cannot be in public as it terrifies me so I don't walk anywhere. I'm also ashamed of my size. Could no exercise be the problem? Im a musician so i get no exercise working either. Once I start an exercise routine at home I know I'll become obsessed like before but maybe it's the only way?What could anyone recommend? I would be very grateful for some advice
