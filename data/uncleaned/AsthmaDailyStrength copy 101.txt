So I have allergy induced asthma and about 3 weeks ago started with a flare up - deep cough, wheezy chest. I take Flovent 100 mcg twice daily in addition to Allegra once daily. Flare up got bad so went to urgent care 8 days ago. They gave me Augmentin, Prednisoneand Xopenex via nebulizer. Today was the 8th day of the meds and I'm no better. The nebi seems to make it worse - def makes stuff rattle around in there but nothing is coming up and the wheezing doesn't go away. Any advice?
