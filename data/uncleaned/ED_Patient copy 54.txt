No EnergyHi Everyone,I have suffered with anorexia for 7 years, I have been on a weight gain meal plan for about 4 months, but over the past 2 months I have been suffering with total lack of energy to the point that even moving seems like a lot of hard work.I am waiting for blood test results, but I think they will come back as normal.I am very close to a healthy weight, so I am concerned why this has started happening now.I have been told to rest and continue with my meal plan, but this is very difficult for me, I've always been quite an active person, so this is very hard for me to cope with.I'm just wondering if this is completely normal and will my energy levels come back and when will this likely happen?Thanks for any replies
