Need some insight- I'm in trouble on my college campus.So last week I was in my boyfriends dorm, and security knocked on the door and said they had been receiving complaints that his dorm smelled like marijuana. He did have marijuana (and I don't agree with it, I want him to quit but that's another story), but it wasn't causing the smell, his roommate had just left to go home for the weekend and probably rolled up something before he left, and didn't bother to cover up the smell.ÊWell, security came to the door and because I was in the room, they wrote my name down and took my address down and everything. I do not smoke, and I never have. This Thursday I have a meeting on campus with the hall director of the dorm to discuss the situation and my punishment (even though I did nothing). I'm freaking out. I am going to tell the truth and everything I know and hope to God they go easy on me.ÊWhat should I do? ANY ADVICE?
