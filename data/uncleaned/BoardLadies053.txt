Single & Happy....So, Im 35 & single. Spent my entire 20's & early 30s in a long term relationships. I recently had a coffee with a friend who is seperated & too is single in her 30's and we were chatting about how other people seem to have more of an issue with us being single that we do ourselves! Im just wondering what peoples opinions are of this?ÊI am in a really good place now, my career is going well, Ive lost a lot of weight (Needed to, put a lot on in the LTR) and I genuinely am happy. Yes at times, it would be nice to have someone to share things with but Im not just going to go out with anyone so that Im not alone.All my friends are married & keep looking at me as if they feel sorry for me - Im actually getting so frustrated with them!So why is it that society seems to think that being single in your 30s is an issue? I recently had a guy tell me on a night out that Im obviously way too picky blah blah, I didnt even know this guy & it really annoyed me. Why do people seem to have so many opinions on this? Yes I would like to meet someone eventually when its the right person......Does anyone else share my frustration or am I the only person that gets so annoyed by peoples reactions??? So condesending at times, ah sure you're a lovely girl how can you be single - COS I want to be!
