How to stand up for myself at work2014-01-07, 01:36 PMI have a nice job but I don't understand a colleague who I work with directly.When she asks me if I want to do something, she says: May I ask you something? Can I use you next week for this or that? Also asks some things from me, like when it was holiday she asked me to buy her something for work, cause we can get the money back from my work. But I wonder why she couldn't buy them herself, but I said very friendly it was no prolem and that I would do it. What can I do or say if I don't like the way she speaks to me? I would never say to someone If I could use them for something. It's a strange word choice in my opinion, it's like she wants to put me down. At other times she asks my advice, is friendly and does not say these things. What to think of this?
