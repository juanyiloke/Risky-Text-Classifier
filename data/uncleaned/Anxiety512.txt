24/7 Anxiety. Coming upto 4 years nowI've had this physical anxiety in my chest for almost 4 years now.Its hard to explain it, but its like my hearts really tight. when im up and about i normally don't even notice it,but as soon as i sit down or try and relax it comes on straight away. sometimes i get this horrible rush, like a burst of adrenaline, and i have to jump up really quickly.i haven't been able to sit down and relax and watch a film or whatever for so long.its always worse in the evening, when i try to go to bed i just can't breath properly, its not that its hard to breath, its so weird, i have to breath in time with my heartbeatelse i'll get one of those horrible rush's of adrenaline (or whatever it is)im also very aware of my heart, i can constantly feel it beating. it sucks trying to sleep.the only relief i get from it is the first 10mins after i wake up.Also it gets really bad when i see like blood on tv like in horror movies, which is also weird cos i love movies like that, and used to welcome gore in movies.I just thought it would go away after a while.Êid really like know if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?thanks
