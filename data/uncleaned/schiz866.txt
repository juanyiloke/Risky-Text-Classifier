Recently I have been hearing/seeing weird things. Earlier today, I was just writing, and I saw "flames" made of shadow all around my laptop, but nobody saw it. It happened for only a couple seconds, so I passed it off as a trick of the light. Last night, I was listening to music. I heard a high-pitched noise. When I put music on it intensified, so as to still be heard, and plugging my ears intensified it even more. When "Kings and Queens" by 30 Seconds To Mars came on, it stopped. As soon as "Get It / Get It" by Tv/Tv came on, it came back. This lasted about an hour. Its' what I imagine wind on a mountain top would sound like. I did a bit of reading on schizophrenia and a few things I noted was that is was possible to believe someone means you harm when they actually do not. I'm not sure, however I know that I deal with a family that (at least I believe) is mean, jerkish, and bad for my health. Now I think it's possible it has to do with some form of psychosis. I tried asking my parents if that was possible, however they passed it off as crazy thirteen year old imagination. Are there any other tell-tale signs of schizophrenia that could be apparent? I am very withdrawn from society, however I've been like that for years. I also read that withdrawing and isolation from society can be an effect of schizophrenia. Thank you for your time, Eli K (Drizzleheart)
