ÊHallucinations, Delusions, but not PsychosisHi all, I hope someone here can help. I've been suffering from hallucinations and delusions over the last couple of months - it took two weeks for me to be honest with my care coordinator about them because they made me so scared to tell anyone. I spent a month in a psychiatric unit due mostly to suicidality and rather than making steps to reduce the prevalance of the visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations instead they focused on trying to distract me, on giving me medication to reduce the anxiety that the hallucinations cause. I constantly feel watched, that my phone is monitored, that every move I make is watched. Even making a post like this is intimidating for me. But despite all this, with no explanation, the doctors have refused to call this psychosis. They call part of it flashbacks from possible PTSD but much of it is not even close to things I have ever actually experienced so that doesn't explain it all.I guess I just want to know if anyone has any experiences of dealing with what I'm told are delusions and hallucinations, and things which scare the hell out of me, but with an unexplained refusal to call it psychotic.
