Im living in hellHELLIm tired of everything, since when i was 6 years old, im already keeping a diary, i always pray and wished to die already, imagine how early was that. And no that i reached 18 im at the peak. I cant do this anymore. I cant live anymore, theres no reason to keep going. And i dont want anpther day to dawn upon me.od already said goodbye to the one that i only love, through text message, and i know he dont get what exactly im saying.I always lived in hell. The house i live is hell, all the people whom i knew are no good, all experiences ived had are enough to end things now.
