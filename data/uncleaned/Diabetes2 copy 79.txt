Help Type 2 diabetes   Hiya ive had type 2 diabetes for two years now im 34 yrs, when i was diagnosed ive was put on metformin 500mgs x4 daily. In feb this year i went to the drs as i was constantly feeling shaky and starving so the gp reduced tablets to 2 metformins daily.Im again now feeling the same again withe blood glucose readings of 4.4 - 5.1 after meals. Is this normal???? I was told that i would never have those feelings on metformin!!!! Im starting to get scared of what ifs....... because tonight i travelled home on public transport and i cant really remember my 30 min journey home.........
