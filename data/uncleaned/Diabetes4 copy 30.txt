Why you do need to take care of yourselfFollowing Lucy's post about only 16% of young people not getting the full checks I mentioned that I had read a harrowing account of someone who failed to take the proper care of themselves only this morning on Facebook.  I messaged the author (who is his wife) for permission to reproduce her post here as most people here cannot see the posts in Diabetes Mastermind as it's a closed group.  Nancy is delighted that I want to share her post.  I know that we do not subscribe to the "frighten people to death with threats of having feet cut off" method of trying to get people to comply... but I did find Nancy's post extremely touching and she expresses well, and without labouring her own part in it, the affect it's had not just on her husband, but upon her too.
