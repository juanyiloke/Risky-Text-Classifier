Hello from NW Indiana, USAHi, my name is Cindy, and I was diagnosed with stage 1a lung cancer in April, 2013.I spent a little time "lurking" before introducing myself, and am delighted to have discovered such an active forum with members so warm and welcoming, knowledgeable and supportive.I am a childhood renal cancer survivor (Wilms Tumor) and had been cancer free until now. We caught sight of a small nodule on my left lung during a CT scan for something unrelated. WOW! Things started moving really quickly after that! Tests, consults, scopes, biopsies, resection, another scope, chest radiation, mets to my brain, and my newest added radiation protocol that started last week. And this is where I am today! I look forward to meeting everyone, sharing, learning, and, hopefully, contributing. The sun's coming up, and I'm on my way outside to greet it.   newly diagnosed with extensive sclcHi all!I was diagnosed with exstensive sclc on July 5th 2013. My cancer is a little different according to my oncolpgost becaus according to him I only have it in my Lymphnodes and nowhere else. Has anybody else ever heard of this. I am about to start my 3rd round of chemo this upcoming Monday. My side affects were pretty mild at first but have gotten worse I am getting thrush in my mouth which they gave antibiotics for and now I am getting red like pimple sores on my head. I lost all my hair but it seems to be growing back and I'm wondering if it's just ingrown hairs.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank YouCindy
