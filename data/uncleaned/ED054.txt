Advice towards healthy weight gain?Hi, I hope this is okay, I don't have an ED (at least I am fairly sure), but I have in the past year or so experienced extreme weight loss and it's starting to become something I've begun to want to fix. About three years ago I was put on a new medication for my epilepsy. I was around a generally normal weight for me. I then switched medications and one of the side effects was weight gain. I gained some weight and it had me a bit depressed for a bit. I didn't really try all that hard to do anything about it, though, since I was busy with school and I'm awful about motivating myself to go to the gym. Especially once I started to feel all gross and just wanted to stay in my pj's at home in bed when I did have free time.Fast forward to about a year ago with periodic depression episodes from first starting (not due to the medication switch, it's actually supposed to have the opposite effect) and I was back at my normal weight. When I go through these episodes I don't eat very much and just lay in bed all day. Since then my weight has continued to drop, which scares me a bit. I don't have much of an appetite even when I'm not depressed lately.So, um, even though whether or not I have an ED is dubious, I hope some of you who are working towards recovery could help me out even though we may be in slightly different boats? I'd like to gain weight in the healthiest way possible, so I'll probably try to work on muscle weight, too, but, yeah...
