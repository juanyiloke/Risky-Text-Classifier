Could this be signs of asthma________________________________________my parents have told me that I have had a small history of asthma in my infant years but have not had an actual attack since I was two years old. Over the past few years I have been working on getting into better shape by bicycling. I have had no problems and have lost a lot of weight because of it. This year I started doing jogging for workouts as a result of my friend talking me into it. I am enjoying it and it is having a noticeable positive effect on my health, however after every jog I noticed myself coughing a lot. Does anyone know if this could be associated with my past history of asthma, and should I look into getting a prescription for an inhaler to use while jogging?
