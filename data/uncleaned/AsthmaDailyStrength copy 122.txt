I'm passing along news from an article that National Jewish Hospital sent out. I can't takeallergy shots since when they get to a certain concentration my asthma attacks and though they tried to decrease the concentration and then increase it again, the asthma still would not tolerate it. So, the allergist abandoned that method years ago in my treatment. The article talks only about cat allergies, but evidently they are experimenting with a variation of the shots that take less time and fewer shots and also are less likely to cause severe allergic reactions from the shots themselves. This is good news as I love cats and Ihope they are successful because maybe I would tolerate that type of allergy desensitation shot.
