Feel like a fraudPosted over a year agoAfter reading other posts i feel a bit of a fraud. I have been recieving theropy and CBT 4 the last 4 years 4 depression but 6 months ago i started seeing a new therapist. After talkin 2 her and opening up 2 her she told me 3 weeks ago i was suffering PTSD, i was shocked i linked this 2 something u suffered if u was at war.I still not get my head around this no1 eles had even mentioned this 2 me b4. Iv had a few traumatic things hapen 2 me and suffer the flash backs nightmares reliving the events but tried 2 deal with them the best i can and tried 2 avoid talkin about them.Mine seem like nothin compared 2 some. As a child i was passed around, sexually assalted, witnessed fatel RTAs, involved in fatel trafic accidents, best friend died in arms after commiting suicide, attacked with a knife none of wich i had any help 4 and have been carrying around with me 4 at least 25years.Can any1 help me understand this PTSD a little more. Have been on web sites but like i said i suffer depression and cncertration not that good and a full screen of words is a little daunting. Therapist is talkin me through it but it would b nice 2 hear from others goin through it2.Any advice and help welcome.
