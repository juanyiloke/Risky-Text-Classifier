Insulin works! - it suprised me how wellHaving had to go onto insulin last August, (T2 about 9 yrs) I was really curious how my HBA1C would have gone from its previous 9.7.I thought it would be better but as my pre meal tests have still been a bit patchy I wasnt hoping for much better than sneaking under 9, maybe 8.5 at a push, as weight has tickled up slightly (only 1kg).A 7.6 result was well beyond my expectations and the Dr seemed pretty impressed too.  so, onto the next phase, tighter control and the joy of carb counting and adjusting dose for them specifically rather than my current guesswork.The question is (as I havent come on today for morale boostng as can happen at times) which app will help me.I have used myfitness pal before for general calories, but I know some are carb and cal fans.The carb and cal app costs money, not alot I know, but others have also said it doesnt have alot of the branded food available, and due to my hectic lifestlye and slovenly attitude I dont do alot of cooking from scratch - (M&S is my friend!). Does Carb & Cal list supermarket ready meals and is it worth the money.Any thoughts very welcomeCheers allMalc
