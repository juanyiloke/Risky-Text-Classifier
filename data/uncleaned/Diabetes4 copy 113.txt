back 2 sq 1Hi all not posted anything since june, hope all is well with u guys   .  I on other hand we have had a set back everything was great all in well readings below 6 and last mth we got it all cant really go into details but we as a couple have been totally stressed 2 the point of not sleeping much and lost quite abit of confidence & faith in all matters.  It is not finally sorted so we are on the mend, but saying that his diet has gone out the window 2 YES back 2 old eating habits 2 which his readings have rocketed 2 (9)   .  I myself feel very disappointed as i cook & prepare all meals and well my hubby is trying to shut the world out by sleeping most of the day.I know it feels like excuses at the min but doesn't help when both are feeling sorry for ourselves!
