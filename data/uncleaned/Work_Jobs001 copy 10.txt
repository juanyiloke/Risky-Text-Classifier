Been offered full time position - unsure? what are my rights?________________________________________Hi all, going unreg for this...Yesterday after 4mnts of starting my new job, my employer has offered me a full time position, only if l can guarantee him I'll stay til next oct. The thing is l dont know what I'll be doing next year. I work in a bar/resturant and have feck all of a social life. I get on with 99% of the people there, management are lovely, always a good atmoshpere about, good wage and tips...plus l never dread a day going in. There my positives. My negatives is I wont be travelling this time next year (which l dont know will i even have to do as I might have to do it on my own). I put on a good act at work to make people happy when really I just wanna punch them in the face (the rude and awkward ones!!). Plus I find it hard to do any hobbies, like I only get 2 weekdays off and its just hard to try and commit to anything. Maybe I need to realise this is just the real working world? Basically what has me divided about this is that my boss siad he doesnt want to offer me this position, and for my to turn around in feb/march saying I'm leaving. He wants my word that I will stay til at least Oct.....Can he really do this? What are my rights in this? How should I handle this? Should I ask for things on my terms eg finish early on a fri or sat evening....must make up my mind by Saturday...I'm just in a heap over this
