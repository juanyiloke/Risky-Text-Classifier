Medication questionPlease forgive me: I know I have not been very forthcoming about my own condition for a number of reasons and as "we are not doctors" no one might want to answer this. I have had one hospice nurse visit. I thought I was doing "OK." Today she sends this package by their supplier--a plastic clear box containing oral morphine, lorazepam, atropine 0/S, Haloperidol and "compro 25mg supp-Bisacodyl 10mg supp. I am convinced that this is the "end of life" packet but why wouldn't I have been notified? (I know I should get answers from her but I do not see her again until Monday and would like any input sooner.Sorry if this request for info is inappropriate in any way. I do live alone. I never disclosed that feelng embarrassed. I have only one close relative, my sister, and she has been coming in every day to help me with stuff and now the hospice is taking over.Sorry again and thank you. Best to all. Kate
