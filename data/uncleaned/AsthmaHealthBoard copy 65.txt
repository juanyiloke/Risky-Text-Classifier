salbuterol causing racing heart and chest pain________________________________________Earlier i felt out of breath and took two extra puffs of albuterol after having taken two puffs earlier in the day. I usually get a slight racing heart but it goes away quickly. I had a couple of sips of diet coke but not too much. Today, my heart rate went up to 115 and my blood pressure went up to 127/92. I had chest pain and tingling in my arm and hand. Eventually with relaxation and some water my heart rate and blood pressure are starting to go back down. Is it common to suddenly have this type of reaction to albuterol after never having it before? I have high blood pressure and take diltiazem and ramipril for it.
