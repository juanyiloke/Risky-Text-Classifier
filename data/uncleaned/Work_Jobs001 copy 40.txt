  Dismissal - need advice?________________________________________I feel I need to explain the entire situation relating to this job so I apologise in advance for the length of this query. I started a 9 month JobBridge internship with this company back in December 2013, but afterwards I couldn't accept full-time work because of a position on a 3 month training course I'd accepted before the job was offered to me. I told my employer I'd be happy to continue working part-time until the course was over and then see about working full time then. I started the part-time work without a contract and was eligible to start on the Social Welfare's casual docket system, but had to write a letter to JobBridge stating that I had been offered full time work and was unable to accept it so that the waiting period before my boss hired another intern was waived. Around 3 months later another intern was hired for the same position I'd been in and I'd helped to train her in while also continuing my own work on an ongoing project. A few months I found out that I was pregnant and then I told my employer about it 3 weeks ago (I'd wanted to wait until after 12 weeks). However, recently I finished up my work on the ongoing project and then my boss asked to speak to me this morning, explaining that I was being given my two weeks notice. Basically now that the project is finished, there isn't enough work to keep both myself and our intern busy so I'm being let go.Does anyone know if I have any rights to appeal this dismissal? Or does the fact that I worked part-time without a contract mean that my employer was entitled to dismiss delay in going back to work________________________________________Hi all. Need a little bit of advice. I'm a permanent civil servant and have been out on sick leave since last July, suffering from depression. Thankfully I have been great since Christmas and wanted to go back to work in Jan. I had been in discussions with the chief medical officer (cmo) about a date to return to work when I found out I was pregnant. The cmo and my gp decided that I would be better off waiting for a few weeks before going back to work as I had to come off all my meds. So since then I have jumped thru hoops, getting letters from different docs who have been treating me and they all say the same thing, I am fit for work. then the cmo would review that letter and decide he wants a report from a different doc... It is doing my head in! I feel like I am in a vicious circle, my mental health is suffering because I am idle, when I was actually sick the days rolled into one. Now everyday feels like a month. I also have an income protection scheme and have been claiming off that but they have deemed me fit to work so I am been cut off at the end of the month. Financial worries isn't going to do my mental health any favours either! So now I am at the point where I am wondering if I would be better off handing in my notice and getting something else.I Need to work, need some normality and routine Can't take aroutine. f this fighting to go back to work. I have tried to contact the cmo several times in the last week and got no response. Guess I need an outside perspective, would I be able to take a constructive dismissal case against them?
