Hi all, i am new to this site so not really sure how it all works yet, hoping this is the right place to post. Just wondering what age other mums allow their children to go out on a trip with their friends and their friends parents? My little boy was 5 in march and has become firm friends with a boy in his year. He has been to his house to play and was absolutely fine but this morning his friends foster mum asked to take my son out to a local bird reserve/playpark. My son said he wants to go so I agreed but I am now worrying he is too young to go off on his own with another family. He has always been a bit clingy and I am worried he will get upset if I am not there. I know his friends foster mum will ring me if there are any problems and I can go to pick him up but I am just worrying if i have done the right thing in saying yes. What are other mums opinions? I know I am probably just being overprotective ננ
