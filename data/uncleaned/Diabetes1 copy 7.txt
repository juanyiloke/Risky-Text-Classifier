So Confused !I have been diagnosed as a diabetic about two years ago and am still struggling to try to control my diabetes with diet as I am trying not to take any medicine. I must say that I am not following the rules as sometimes I even have chocolate which I know is very bad! Today the problem is that in the morning when I woke up my glucose was 9. Ii only had a glass of carbonated water with some lemon and when i tested again after an hour it was 10. I really do not know what is happening as I thought that after an hour with only a glass of water my sugar levels were supposed to go down not up! Has anybody gone through this? I am so confused.
