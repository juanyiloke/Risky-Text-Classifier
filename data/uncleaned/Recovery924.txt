  I know my purposei dont want to stay alive a lot of the time but i have to.i need to stay alive for my girlfriend. i need to give her someone to look up to, someone to push her to keep going, someone to love her and remind her how loved and beautiful she actually is. i need to stay alive to see she gets treatment, to make sure she is alive........and if things dont work out, to stay her friend. i am confident in our relationship and i will stay alive for her.i believe my purpose in life is to help others. and i want to continue to do that.she said we would work things out together, get through our mental illnesses together....and thats what im counting on.
