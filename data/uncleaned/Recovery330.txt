 Reasons To Be ProudI suffer on a daily basis with depression, anxiety, no confidence and low self esteem and yet there are times in my life when I have done pretty impressive things - - gave birth 3 times with no pain relief - once at a planned home birth and one in a birthing pool - learned to drive and passed my test when I was 6 months pregnant with my third baby - studied from home to get professional qualifications- did a fire walk for charity last year- been self employed for over four years- sorted out a mortgage on a flat when I was 18 years old and lived alone and supported myself for about 3.5 years- been abroad three times despite being petrified of flyingI have done all this and more in the last 17 years, despite constantly struggling.At the moment, my life is manageable, but I want it to be awesome. I don't want to have to push, struggle and fight my way each and every day, I want to enjoy it and have fun. I am so over feeling depressed and anxious all the time, I want to be happyLooking back on some of the things that I have done, I find it hard to believe that it was me, but it was, I did it, we can all do it, we just need love, support, understand, courage and a willingness to fight
