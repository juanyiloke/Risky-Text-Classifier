I am type 1 diabetic with a severe asthma flare! I just finished a medrol dose pack yesterday.. I still have lots of bronchospasms and wheezing and some shortness of breath. My doctor wants to put me on 20 milligrams of prednisone for a week and then 10 milligrams of prednisone for another week. My blood sugars have been as high as 500.. I have talked to my endocrinologist and she doesn't really know what to do to control my blood sugars.. I've been exhausted having to check them every 2 hours.. I'm at my wits end and feeling very anxious and suicidal. I'm scared to start the next dose tomorrow ofprednisone because I don't know what's going to happen with my blood sugars. I can't go to the hospital around here or nearby because they don't know how to adjust insulin pumps. I am so scared and don't know what to do. Has anyone else been through this? I don't think I can stand this emotionally but without the steroids I don't think I'm going to get better.
