A serious eating problem...So I have been lucky in life to have a very efficient and high metabolism. However, somehow, it got into my brain, that since I'm 20 now, I'm going to start packing on the pounds. I'm not underweight. I restrict eating and over exercise. Then I'll get these horrible sugar cravings and can't focus on anything. This leads me to binge.Then I will feel really guilty and hate myself for days. The cycle repeats. I am sick and tired of feeling like crap and punishing myself. I wish I could tell someone, but I am not good with face to face talk and I am really embarrassed. I'm in college and am starting to get distracted from my schoolwork because I can't stop thinking about food. I don't purge. I am still getting my periods too....but I am really scared that this situation is just going to continue spiraling downhill. Recently, my binges have increased in frequency. just can't stop eating no matter how bad it makes me feel. I want to get help, but I can't bring myself too. I don't have money to pay and if I use insurance, my parents will find out, and at this point, I really don't want them to. I'm ashamed that I can't control myself and am really not sure what to do. Thank you in advance for any advice ya'll can give me.
