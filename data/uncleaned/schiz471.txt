Ê[B]Recluse[B]I've become seriously reclusive. I moved to wales in 2010 and find meeting people really difficult. I went to college and the only people I met there took drugs. I have a history of drug abuse. Admitted to hospital with drugs psychosis staying away from drugs is a must. Being english makes me feel different to everyone else. Drop in groups seem to be filled with people who are a lot older than me.Any advice on how to get out more and socialise?
