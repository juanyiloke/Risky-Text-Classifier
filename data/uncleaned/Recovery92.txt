Relaxing Or Soothing Sayings In Other Languages!I think that language is such an amazing, amazing thing.  It has given us the gift of communication.  Of course, sometimes language can be a problem since there are soooo many and not everyone speaks the same one! That's okay though, because I think we should all take some time to learn new languages so we can further connect ourselves with other people from different countries and cultures.  So I wanted to start this thread, to hear what you say in your country, or what you know other people say in other countries, to express relief and comfort and happiness.  I'll start! First, I have heard in England, they say, Please, all Englanders or people with family from England, feel free to correct me or add your own!! Next, in Russian, it is a common thing to say,Anyone else have anything to add? If you are from another country, or know someone from another country, or have traveled to another country, or are multilingual, etc. I would LOVE to hear any common idioms or expressions of comfort in your language! xoxoSunny
