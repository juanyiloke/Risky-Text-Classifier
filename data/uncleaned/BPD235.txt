 intrusive thoughtshi this is the first time I have done anything like this I haven't spoken to anybody outside of my family apart from my mental health team about my struggles.I was diagnosed as bpd back in June last year I have made great improvements with violent out bursts and I feel I'm starting to understand my mind a lot better but at the moment I have been really struggling with intrusive thoughts they are becoming harder and harder to distract my self from they can be very violent some times I feel like I have saw film going on in my head to the point where it makes my stomach turn i am also suffering with intense tension headaches after having intrusive thoughts feel like I have me my mind and the devil in my head but there not enough room for all of them I would be greatful if any one could give me any Advice on how to cope and reduce these intrusive thought thankyou:
