WoweeeeeeeeeeeeeMy granddaughter and d-i-l have not long gone from here after going to Coombe Abbey today where ( Tamsan ) my granddaughter wants to be married.ÊIts all booked for the 22nd of March next year and hubby and I will be getting a ride in a Mercedes.ÊKeeping my fingers crossed now that hubby and I are still here to see our only grandchild have her fairytale wedding to the only lad she has been with since school days.ÊWe will be staying the night at this lovely place and just hoping and praying now that we will both be OK healthwise to attend it.ÊMy lovely granddaughter has also asked me if I would write a poem for her special day to be read out at the ceremony.ÊIt is something to live for and look forward to. Wish us luck.Ê
