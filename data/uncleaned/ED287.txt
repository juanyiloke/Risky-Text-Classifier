ÊTrying to Recover... ConflictedRecently I've been getting a lot of help with my ED. I have a whole team of people trying to help me now. My GP, psychiatrist, dietitian, and this week a therapist will be added to the list. Everything feels like it's been completely insane. My family is treating me like they did when I was sick as a kid. It's very bizarre.Thing is, even with all this help coming at me and all these rules being laid out, something in me feels horrible about all of it. It's as if there's this voice telling me not to listen to them. That they're going to stop caring if I follow the rules and I'll be on my own again. It's like it's telling me, when I'm alone, "you're the only one making yourself eat right now. You could throw that food away and no one would know. If you eat that you're doing what they want, and you WILL gain weight, and they'll stop looking and checking but I'll always be here". That terrifies me. It scares the shit out of me so, sometimes, I DO throw the food away. Sometimes I'll exercise because I don't want the numbers on the scale to go up and because I hate hearing them say "you did a good job this week".ÊI feel fake. I feel fake if I eat- a fake anorexic. It's like that voice is saying "there, you never had a real problem. See?". And if I don't eat, I feel like I'm playing tricks on everyone, dragging everyone through my problems and purposely 'acting out' for attention. I don't want to be that person. I hate myself if I eat and I hate myself if I don't.ÊAnybody else feel like this when they first try to recover? Is this normal? Or am I really so fake?
