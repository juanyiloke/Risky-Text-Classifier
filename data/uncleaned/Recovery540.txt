  overcoming lonelinessI have been so lonely the past few weeks. I even feel lonely when I post on these boards now. I read an article explaining the phenomenon of loneliness and though it's not rocket science, I found that their definition and views on loneliness really hit me.I always  considered loneliness a definite for people who didn't have friends. Since I don't have a lot of friends, a boyfriend or anyone for that matter, it makes me feel pretty  awful like I am just doomed to inevitable loneliness, but I realize now that this isn't true. The article emphasized that loneliness is a state of mind. I find that I need to remember this as I go forward. Just because I am alone doesn't mean I am lonely or that I have to be lonely. Even though i can't think of anyone who loves me or cares , I just tell myself that I am not alone and for now it's working. I've cried a river these past couple  weeks and simply  telling myself I am not alone has helped tremendously. In case you want to read the article, the link is below. It's certainly not inspirational or anything, but it does explain loneliness and its detrimental effects in great detail. Perhaps understanding it will help someone as it's helped me.
