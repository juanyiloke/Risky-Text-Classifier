RisperdolMy son has been on risperdol for many years. However, it does not seem to be working anymore. He seems to be running on high octane. Nothing gets finished yet he's always busy doing nothing. He has lost two jobs in the past year. He has a wife and children and he loves them very much. He just can't seem to get it together. I think he needs to go on another medication or have another medication added to the risperdol. His whole life is turned upside down - and he won't listen when I try and talk to him. I've asked him to see adoctor and he says there's nothing wrong with him. His wife is at her wits end and about to kick him to the curb. He's my son, I will never do that but I need help so that I can help him. Thank you.
