Metforminhad my check up to-day and after being 10 years diet controlled I have been put on Metformin I'm Type 2 by the way. I am to take just one 500mg with my breakfast but not to increase the dose as I believe one usually does. I'm to go back in June after a blood test and to see how I'm getting on. That's fine by me. I've read up the leaflet in the box of pills and while I'm not a drinker it mentions alchol. Does it mean I can't have any at all not even one to wet my great grandchilds head when it arrives. Bit chessed about having to have medication after all this time. I would be pleased for any hints and tips about the effects of Metformin
