Interesting news about aspartame.I remember how pleased my friends were when aspartame received FDA approval, friends who worked for GD Searle, the manufacturer. Mainly because it had been rejected for several years, but Reagan had just become President and appointed a new director of the FDA.  I love a good conspiracy theory, but this is no theory.Now it seems the Americans public in the form of diet Pepsi drinkers have requested it's removal more than anything else and it will be replaced with Splenda or is that Splender?Seems the BBC reported it on 27th April, I missed that. Interestingly in the UK you'll still be able to buy Pepsi with aspartame.
