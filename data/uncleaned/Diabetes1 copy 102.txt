High Intensity Training (HIT) - Dr Michael Mosley (Horizon)A few threads have referred to High Intensity Training which Dr Michael Moseley referred to in BBC's Horzon earlier in 2012. ¥	After a brief warmup of gentle cycling (several minutes), pedal as fast as you can for 20 seconds Cycle gently for 2 minutes to catch your breath Cycle all-out again for 20 seconds, followed by 2 minutes of gentle cycling.Repeat all-out cycling one more time.I've been following this regime using a cross-trainer since the programme aired in February 2012 and it certainly helps me. I still do the more sustained excercise such as long walks but HIT is convenient for my lifestyle. I am certainly far too tight to sign up to a gym!Are there any other HIT fans here?Ref - plenty of links can be found by Googling "High Intensity Training Dr Michael Moseley Horizon"
