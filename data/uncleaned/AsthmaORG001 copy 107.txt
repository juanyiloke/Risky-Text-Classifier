Prescription quantities Had a rather fretful day today collecting my prescription from my new doctor's surgery as they would only prescribe me 1 symbicort inhaler (120 puffs) rather than the usual 3 that my previous doctor prescribed me. Nobody at the surgery would listen to me when I tried to explain that 1 was not enough as my regular dose would only see me through one month but that, at the present time, it will probably only last me about 20 days due to the fact that the symbicort is a smart inhaler which can be used as a reliever too and I am going through a bad stage with my asthma at the moment so require more puffs. My question is whether there is any law governing how many inhalers can be prescribed in one prescription? My new surgery just did not want to listen to what I was trying to say and they wouldn't let me speak to a doctor about it either claiming the doctors were all out and wouldn't be back for two hours !! I was so upset that I burst into tears but the woman just looked at me with zero understanding. I'm determined to go back to them and speak to a doctor about it but just wanted to know if I could throw some facts at them about it. Many thanks. Sharry
