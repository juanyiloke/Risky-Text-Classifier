Men in social situationsIs it true to claim that socially men can get away so much more than women when it comes to being introverted ( or quiet or shy ). For example a guy can spend time on his own like go clothes shopping, go fishing, get something to eat at a restaurant and go for a pint or to watch the match but nobody would blink an eyelid or say its weird. but if a woman did any of this people would say she was odd and friends or acquantances would probably not put her at the top of their list as potential buddies or people who were fun etc.Even when in a group of friends and the company of others eg in the pub, its grand for a guy to say little, just sit there taking it in over a pint or in deep concentration looking at the match.Whereas the women are expected to be talking be interesting be fun be heard and if a quiet woman sat there saying nothing the other girls probably would notice this, would talk about it and use it as a reason not to socialise with her next time.I know a lot of women who are chatty enough, confident etc but don't have much friends or none at all, and I know men who are quiet, don't talk much , sit there saying little in social situations but are a magnet for friends.Is this just my interpretation or does anyone else feel this is true or have encountered similar experiences with people.
