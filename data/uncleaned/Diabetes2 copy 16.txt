Sugar in foods - Benefits being withheld from obese people  2  The latest interest in the amount of sugar in processed foods has made me think about the other latest benefits story (I think I have heard it right) that people with obesity will be penalised with benefits being withheld.  Whether or not this is true I hope the Government intends to ensure that the food industry reduces the amount of sugar they put into processed foods first.  A lot of obesity is due to hidden sugars in food rather than peoples greed.  It is addictive and once addicted there are real problems dealing with this. There needs to be more thought put into these actions before people are penalised for their weight increase.  Not everyone can reduce their weight that easily.  Obesity does have a lot of bearing on whether or not we develop diabetes but come on manufacturers help us out..........reduce the sugar you use in our foods.
