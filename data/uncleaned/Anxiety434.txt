How do I know if the threat is real?So, I've been told that if there is a real threat, I will have an automatic reaction to that threat, so I don't need to worry about it. I still have this feeling (probably anxiety) that if I leave it to my "fight or flight" reaction in the moment, I may be setting myself up for potential threats. I might be vulnerable.ÊFor example, I don't have a car right now, so in order to get where I need to go, I have to take the bus, and then walk the rest of the way to my destination. I keep thinking that by walking the rest of the way (up to 20 minutes), that I will be putting myself at risk to whatever may be "out there."ÊI'm also reminding myself that it's during the day, and I'm not walking through dark alleys, but I'm still worried that something may happen because I put myself out there, and it would be my fault.ÊUgh, any help with this anxiety-induced mess of a thought process?
