British student lifeby irisparisHi everyone, I'm currently applying to various master's degree in Uk and had one offer (still waiting for others though) and as a non-british student, I clearly don't know where I'm going through since the british and french systems are definitely not the same.. I just want to know how classes go, how many exams can do we have per month, etc..And especially concerning the part-time mode, I know that you have 2-3 days per week of study but what else should I know about it please?Thanks
