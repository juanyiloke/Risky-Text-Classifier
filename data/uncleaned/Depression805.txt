Self-neglect -- anyone else?It's gotten to the point this year where my psychologist has had to help me make daily checklists of what to eat, when to eat it (I'm being treated for anemia that got so bad I was dizzy all the time too from malnutrition), plus meds from the surgery I had, my iron pills and antidepressants, and is trying to convince me to let her get some people in to help me with cleaning. I look like I don't give a damn about myself, half the time my clothes are dirtyish at work, I don't remember the last time I brushed my hair (I finger comb it in the shower). I only have a job because nobody else wants to work nights and they look the other way when I call in sick. My finances are such a mess that my salary is being garnished from ignoring it so long, and now I barely make enough to survive. It's pathetic, I'm 32 and I just don't have any self-respect and my functioning is so low. It's actually scary at times. I really just don't care about myself and sometimes disrespecting myself feels good
