Everyone had their quarterly review already except for me?2013-04-06, 09:02 PMI've had a really tough quarter. I was on a project with two other employees and one of them ( a temporary) employee was cut from company and then the other employee that I had working with me switched to a different department. ( This was her voluntary decision.)Needless to say I got stuck in a bad situation and ended up having to pick up a lot of slack. My company works on a quota system but it's understandable why some of my numbers are lower considering I lost people on my project. ( We had individual roles and depended on each other to get our work done).The problem is my department is starting to do their quarterly reviews. It seems like everyone else has been called into my managers office EXCEPT for me. I already confronted my manager about this and he claimed that he is still working on mine and that it would be in a couple weeks. He also said that mine is not the only review that isn't done yet either. I want to belive him but should I?How can I confront him about this? I'm worried that I will be faulted in some way shape or form because I lost people on my project. Please help.
