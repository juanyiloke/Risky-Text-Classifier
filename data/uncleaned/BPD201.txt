ÊJust want someone who know what it's like.Hi all. I'm new to this particular forum but not to the disorder. I've known all my life that I was different and pretty weird. I won't go into all of what made me this way, including heredity but if y'all wanna know something, ask away.ÊMy diagnosis was made about six years ago when I was 40. But I've always had the symptoms, just had NO clue it was mental! Lol. I'm high functioning BPD and also bipolar though the BPD is much more prevalent.ÊI was on antipsychotics until a few months ago. I have a phobia of side effects. And like many before me...thought maybe it just went away. I'm cured...hooray! Lol. I did some DBT. Mostly just let the drug make me an emotionless waste.ÊI have OCD and major depression as well. I'm the typical chameleon. ..wear that mask well. My biggest problem is trying not to let my issues get me fired. I am a cashier for the biggest retailer in the world...guess who. And I have some of the meanest, nastiest customers alive. You can guess how that affects me.ÊWhen looking for a" safe" place on here, I find places for family of BPD ppl. I feel very wary of them. Does anyone else feel" attacked" by them? So I chose this forum because it seems more welcoming to us mental folk. Lol.ÊMy hubby has issues but he doesn't want to discuss any of this. So here I am. I need ppl who know what it's like. I need to be able to talk and have someone listen. I hope y'all will have me...screwed up as I am. Thanks for reading.....
