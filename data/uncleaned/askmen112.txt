MBA or Start Up Business2011-11-05, 02:26 PMI'm in my final year as an undergrad and I really want to start my own internet business upon graduation, I've been working on the business plan for a few months now. Only problem is my parents want me to go straight to grad school, I would like to get my MBA eventually from a top tier school such as Stanford, Mellon, Wharton, Babson, etc. in places with strong networking bases. However, at this time I don't feel i quite measure up to the school's requirements and I would like to get some experience under my belt by whetting my entrepreneurial curiosities. How should I tell this to my parents? I welcome all advice!
