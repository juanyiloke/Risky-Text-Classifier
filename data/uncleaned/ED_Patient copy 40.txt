Bulimia and pulled back muscle?I suffer with bulimia. For the last couple of weeks I've noticed the odd twinge in my lower back while purging (standing and bending over). A few days ago I moved from sitting to standing and my back just seemed to give out causing me to be in a lot of pain when I move, especially between sitting and standing. I saw my GP and he told me I'd pulled a muscle. Is it possible that the purging caused this? I have been bulimic for roughly 15 years but lately I have been binging and purging several times a day (more than usual). I've never had any problems with my back before and, other than a lot of reflux, am generally healthy. I'm 34 and female.
