Out Damn Spot Out!This morning my doctor called and said the x-ray they took Monday for the bronchitis showed a spot on my left lung. They had scheduled a CT for this afternoon.ÊI was a little anxious and I put a call into my T and left a request for a callback. Calling helped and she called back after the test.This afternoon the diagnostic placed called back and said it was negative. I was a "little" relieved. I came to the conclusion though that I feel so numb that I really didn't give much of a crap. I was worried who would take care of my Mom but I only just exist from one day to the next.Not much to look forward to, lonely, and so tired. Seems I just create a void in time and space. No one that I can call about maybe being sick other than my T. I can't even seem to feel happy about not being sick.I feel like George Bailey sometimes except nothing really changes after I'm removed from existence.
