Whether to participate on clinical trial After a voluntary request for a PSA test (with no symptoms) resulted in a PSA of 199 I was immediately (same week) put in for MRI, CT Scan and Biopsi. The prognosis on 7th January was that I has Gleeson 3+4 cancel in prostate and it had spread to Left Hip bones.HT has been initiated. I am told that Radiology is not useful since the Cancer has Metastatised.However I have been invited to participate in an NHS clinical trial.There are 3 groups and I would be randomly alocated to one.1st Group a is control group with HT but monitored more closely2nd Group has radiotherapy on the basis that some studies have shown that killing core cancer also helps reduce mestatatised cells.3rd Group in introduces Zytiga and Xtandi immediately instead of waiting till HT ceases to hold the PCa in check. I'm new to all this and am not sure I want additional side effects until I have to.Does anyone have any experiences they could share with me.Like how long is it before HT ceases to hold the PCa at bay.Thanks for any help and advise
