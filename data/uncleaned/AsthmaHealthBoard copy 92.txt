Multiple Severe Asthma Attacks in the Hospital - Help & Advice________________________________________My girlfriend was diagnosed with mild asthma as a child, but her asthma attacks have recently become very frequent and severe. Currently, my girlfriend is recovering in the hospital ICU after several very severe asthma attacks she had a few nights ago. This has been a frightening experience, and I have since been trying to find more information that will help improve her asthma.A few nights ago, she woke at around 11 pm with chest tightness and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler, which eased her wheezing, and she fell back asleep. About 3 hours later, she woke again with more wheezing and tightness, but this time, her albuterol inhaler only helped for a few minutes. She decided to take medication through her nebulizer machine. After her nebulizer treatment, her breathing improved and I left to make her some hot tea. When I returned, I found her sitting up on the bed, hunched over, and struggling hard to breathe. She had a lot of trouble speaking, her breathing sounded very tight, and I noticed that her ribcage area was sucked in. We decided that she should go to the ER.In the ER, her asthma seemed to finally ease up for a bit after several breathing treatments, but quickly became worse. She had two more asthma attacks while being treated in the ER. The ER doctor said that it was the worst asthma attack he has seen in a long time. She was intubated and hospitalized in the ICU. Two days later, she was extubated. We were told that she would be ready to go home in a few more days. But last night, 2 days before she would be able to come home, she went into another severe asthma attack in the hospital and was placed back on the ventilator. Needless to say, all of this has been frightening and worrisome. I have been trying to find out as much as I can about severe asthma, recovery after multiple severe attacks, how to deal with these types of asthma attacks, and how to prevent future episodes. What do I need to know to better help my girlfriend recover while she is in the hospital and after she is discharged? What can I do to help her during her asthma attacks? Any information or experiences in dealing with and recovering from severe asthma and multiple asthma attacks would be very much appreciated.
