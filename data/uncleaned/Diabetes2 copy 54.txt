diabetes   It is a very serious thing and needs to be monitored ..you must check bloods ..watch diet so very very important .....I have controlled mine for 8 years .....Goodle the things you should eat if you are not sure ....foods that are slow digesting ....(take timeto go through the systum and keep you satisfied from hunger pangs )allowing the blood sugars to run out of control causes nerve damage that can not be repaired .......so take it seriously ........get all the help you can "Diabetes Org" is useful if you are just learning and there are many books on the subject ........Good Luck and Take Good Care of yourselves only YOU can do it ........God Bless Margaret xxxxxxxxxxxxx
