Has anyone experienced disassociation?Can anyone share with me their experience with disassociation? I've recently learned that that thing I do where I space out, or "go elsewhere" and have all these blank spots, has a name.Is disassociation bad? Is it a symptom of something else? ÊWhat can I do?
