Thoughts on symptoms...________________________________________I was diagnosed with asthma about 5 years ago. My 11yo son was diagnosed at around 3yo. We both have cough variant asthma. My 19yo dd was on her way to work and suddenly felt lots of pressure on her chest. She also felt pain, but it was towards her diaphragm. She told me that breathing did not cause pain. Also, she said she could breathe, but had trouble getting enough breath and the problem was with the inhale. I ran up there and let her use my inhaler and she told me that it did help. She was hospitalized RSV as an infant.Obviously, there is a family history.She also has allergies which appear to be getting worse and where I need to have her checked out. They are bothering her a little now, but the season hasn't started yet. She seems to have a big problem with weeds.I have felt the tightness and pressure. I have trouble breathing, but it is on the exhale.I have never had pain in my diaphragm.She was not worried or anxiousShe is petite and in a good weight range.....thin, but not too thin.I was simply wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this. I am able to see an allergist without a referral, but I'm not completely sure if this is asthma related or not. It seems to be since the inhaler did help. I just wondered if anyone else had had the pain and inhaling issues.
