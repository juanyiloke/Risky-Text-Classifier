Might be triggering* Need some supportSo I have an eating disorder for almost 3 years now. I met my boyfriend a year back and once we became official I told him about my struggles with food. I tried for him to do better and eat normally. I would feel tremendous guilt if I had to tell him I slipped so that kept me from letting myself slip. I went from 2 years engaging in Ed actions to 4 months to only struggling a few times. Which I am so proud of. However, I am back to s heavier weight and I mean this in a logical way not in I fell heavier, I am. Well I decided to work out and start watching what I eat. I don't think I know how to be healthy and I need help because the tiniest anxiety can cause me to feel out of control. I'm back to feeling hopeless and I'm having negative thoughts and I want to try and help stop them before I get lost in the grips of an eating disorder again. I don't have anyone to talk to besides my boyfriend but telling him gives me the most anxiety. I would really appreciate a friend or someone to give me advice on the process of recovery. As I just kind of jumped into it unwillingly but really want to stay in it because I know that nothing good comes from an Ed.
