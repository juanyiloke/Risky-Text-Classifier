OneTouch Verio IQ accuracyHi everyone!Is anyone around the forum using onetouch verio iq? I got it from the free giveaway and I really like it, but I've found a lot of opinions that it tends to read higher than other meters... I'm not sure if it's true, I don't remember seeing much difference with my other meter and my DSN knew the Verio and was happy for me to switch to it. I wouldn't give much thought to those opinions online, but my A1C seems lower than what my readings say. For example, according to my CGM average (calibrated with the verio) my a1c should be around 1% higher than it is (yes, my A1C is LOWER than I expect it to be)... Even given the "standard" inaccuracy of the meters 1% A1C difference is quite a lot... or maybe not?Any opinions?
