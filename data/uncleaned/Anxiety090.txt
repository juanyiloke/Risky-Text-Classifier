Please help me, I am so scared! Ê8    Hello all, I have   before, but I got really freaked out this morning, I am so scared something is really wrong! While many of my symptoms have gone away over the past couple of weeks, I still am having some issues.So basically here is the newest story:I was sitting down, getting started on my English final in college, and I got to a section where I did not know what they wanted, did not know the answers, etc and right around then, I suddenly started feeling like I was getting major floaters in my vision, the words written on the white paper just seemed smudged, and I just really freaked out! Then when I got up to turn that section of the exam in, I just somewhat felt weak in the legs and just overall "woozy"....Now that it is over and I am back home, I am feeling a bit better again. Lately I have seen "floaters" here and there (mostly when outdoors), brief tingling in my feet (mostly left) and headaches (either down by left ear, jaw, or upper left (kind of by the temple area), and sometimes I get whooshing sounds in my left ear briefly. I did not have really any of these symptoms except for the tingling up until a month   after I freaked out about things I saw on google. I am just so so so worried you guys, and even though I tell my mom and grandma all of this, they really do not seem concerned at all. I just feel so scared!Ê
