Diabetes and Job applicationsI live in the UK, and have recently been made redundant. Am currently completing job applications and a lot of the online application forms ask the question "are you disabled" to which I have always said no. However the question now includes ... "Are you disabled (including any unseen disabilities, such as dyslexia, diabetes, etc). I don't think diabetes is a disability and it really annoys me. Am I right to be annoyed or does anyone think it is justifiable to ask this?Thanks
