Pet if test negative for dog or cat allergy________________________________________Hello everyone,I have had asthma since I was 10 and am considering getting a dog or cat. I lived with cats from the ages of 10-22 and pet rats for a few years in my late 20s. I have never had allergy symptoms such as postnasal drip, runny nose, hives, and itchy eyes when around cats or dogs, and have tested negative for allergies to cats and dogs on a skin ***** test in 2003 and intradermal testing in 2010. My asthma seems to be triggered by getting run down, exercising in cold air, and being outside a lot when molds or some grasses/trees are prevalent, which have shown up in my skin ***** tests and intradermal tests as well.My new asthma doctor (I moved recently) has no problem with me getting a cat or dog while my previous one advises me not too, saying even if I am not currently sensitive I can develop allergies to a cat or dog if I live with it and it can irritate my asthma anyway. Anyone have experience with this and developing allergies to a pet or having it clearly aggravate your asthma even if you have tested negative for pet allergies? The latter one did say if I absolutely wanted to live with one, my best bet was a smaller dog so I was exposed to less dander, their dander isn't as bad as cats, and I can wash it more often than a cat. I love pets and have always wanted a dog but also don't know how great the risk is of getting worse; maybe an aquarium would be a safer bet. I considering adopting a 36-lb neutered terrier mix with wiry fir that does not shed much but maybe I need to go smaller if I do get one.
