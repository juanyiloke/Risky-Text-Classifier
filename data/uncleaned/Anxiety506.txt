Ughh....muscle twitching in my right arm tricep and a staticWell after last May having my first symptoms come up with a weird feeling in my arm that led to tingling/numbness and then tightening of my muscles I was afraid I had ALS or MS, even though the hospital told me it was most likely carpel tunnel.Ê I had an EMG and nerve conduction done that came back negative for nerve or muscle damage.Ê So the neuro said it's anxiety.Ê Fast forward a year, and things seemed to get better till today.Ê I had a static like shock feeling quickly hit me mid way down my back where my spine is, that dissipated within 5 secs.Ê On top of that, my tricep has been twitching on and off for the last few days, and there seems to be a feeling of heavyness/sluggishness in my tricep.Ê I am worried its MS again, does this sound serious or just the anxiety?
