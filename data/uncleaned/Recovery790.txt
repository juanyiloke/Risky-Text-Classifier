can anyone suggest what they do to help?Hi all,          So I suffer both anxiety and depression, and was wondering what tips can you give me to just help get through the day or even as soon as I wake up for everyday I feel great anxiety to the point I do not want to get out of bed and face the day.I've been told numerous times that meditation works but I honestly just struggle with the concept as I feel more anxious and/or depressed while attempting it. (Obviously have no idea how to do it properly)Exercise makes me feel better, but I am wondering what do people do to get that motivation to get out of bed and live the day for that is what I struggle with?Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thankyou :)
