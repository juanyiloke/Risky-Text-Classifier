New resultsJust checked my results on the Scottish site that lets you look at your test results and things.Hb1Ac was 7.3 (this is personal best for me as my brother puts it) It is the latest in a downward tread since getting my pump    Total cholesterol 5.2HDL 1.12 (pretty low for me)LDL 3.8 (about what I normally get)Trigs 0.6 (lower than normal) As always I'm not really sure on the cholesterol. I know low trigs is good and that my HDL isn't looking as good as it was this time last year. I had a bit of carb creep which I think explains that so I'm lowering them again and adding some more fats.
