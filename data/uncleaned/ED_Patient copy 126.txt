im the person who posted on 7th june 06im now 8st 7lbs. an inch taller (!!!) but suffering from osteoporosis  if i could stop just one person going through this pain it would be worth it. im nowhere near recovered. ive realised my ed started far before i first admitted, and the effects last much longer than it takes to gain the weight back. since my last post i initially got worse but started to recover very slowly. there have been many setbacks along the way (not to mention my 6months in psych units :shock  but it is possible. but that doesnt mean you have to do it on your own. i still have a tretment team, i will probably see an ed team for the next year if not longer, but to be alive makes it worth it.i just wanted to give some hope to people who are struggling. yes, i feel disgusting and huge every single day, but i have far more of a life than anorexia could ever give me.if anyone wants to email me for support ill do my best to help. my email is ****(Sorry but Patient Admin have removed either a telephone number, an email address, and or web address, from this posting, as it is the policy of Patient UK not to publish these on this forum.If you wish to communicate directly with people, you should register, for free, with the forum (click Register in the menu list below the green banner above).
