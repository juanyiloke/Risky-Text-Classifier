Testosterone Total v Free Just got the results of my last blood test and my PSA has shot up from 0.21 to 0.58 ng/mL. This is over a period of only 8 weeks. I stopped taking Casodex 9 weeks ago to see if my man boobs would reduce in size and I’m disappointed to say there has been no change. So it looks as though I’ll have resume taking the Casodex. I had been on 50mg for almost 18 months.I had my testosterone checked, which I don’t normally do, and there are two readings TOTAL which 4.5 ng/mL (15.6 nmol/l) and FREE which is 12.3 pg/mL. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between the Total & Free, I’ve never come across this before, with regards to Testosterone, PSA yes.Cheers,Stu
