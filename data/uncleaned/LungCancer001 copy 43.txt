Here we go again......New to site:I am 9 years post upper right lobectomy because of cancerous tumor. About a month ago started coughing up bloody mucus. Went to my GP who put me on atibiotics. Got a little better them it all came back. He then scheduled a CT of chest. He got results back of a large spiculated mass in superior section of right lung. Right hilar lymphadenopathy susspicious of metastatic disease. He sent me to Oncologist who has followed me since surgery 9 years ago. She ordered PET and Biopsy. They aborted biopsy because mass had gotten smaller and the doctor didnt want to do it at that time. He wanted to wait 3 weeks and do another CT. PET did light up bright as well. So im waiting on another CT scan on the 5th september and then see Oncologist on the 8th sept. Is all this taking too long ??
