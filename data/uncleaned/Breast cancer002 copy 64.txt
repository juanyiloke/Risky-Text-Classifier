Side effects - Tamoxifen and Zoladex¥	Hello everyone¥	I haven't posted in a while but now its time to ask for your advice. I had my mastectomy in December and then started on Tamo in January. All was fine until my oncologist has now put me onto Zoladex injections for my ovaries.¥	The side effects have basically exploded. I am so emotional I am crying at the drop of a hat, I have headaches and the worst thing is the night sweats. I can't remember the last time I slept through the night.¥	I did not have to have chemo and I know this puts me into the lucky category. I know the meds are preventative and I don't want to have a reocurrence but I don't feel myself at the moment.¥	I have an appointment with my hospital psychiatrist on Weds just to talk which will help I know but any advice about night sweats will be very gratefully received.¥	Vicki
