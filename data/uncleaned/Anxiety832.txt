Valentines Day: is anyone else feeling anxious or depressed by this upcoming commercial event?With valentines Day this weekend here in the UK its all roses, cards, chocolates, mini breaks and meals out ...or is it?I have very personal reasons for not celebrating this media fest, but from my anxiety standpoint I always felt ridiculously under pressure to go buy flowers then book a meal in a restaurant where loads of couples will be happily smiling and trying to out do one another.Depression is a lonely beast. Anxiety is a ravenous wolf.Lets not let this Valentines Day be a huge emotional bumfest, eh.ÊHere's to us.Mark
