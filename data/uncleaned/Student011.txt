 Do most students get financial help from parents? (Pgs: 1 2 34 5 …  )by CaptainBananaI have been surprised that in my 2 years thus far of uni, most students I have met and spoken to seem to be getting financial help from their parents.Granted I'm at a London Uni, but it was my understanding that most students were expected to live off of their maintenance loan?I get about a grand over the minimum loan so maybe this is easier for me to do, but I've yet to speak to someone at uni who doesn't get money from their parents.Was I completely wrong in thinking students supported themselves purely via their loan, and is it actually the case that most students are receiving financial help from their parents?I'd be very interested to hear people's answers.
