Hair loss!!Hi everyone, I've been losing handfuls of hair over this last 4 months since my anxiety and panic attacks has flared up. I'm not sure if it's from the stress that caused my anxiety or from the Lexapro that I'm now on. Has anyone else had this? I'm scared I'm going to lose all my hair! I've never had my hair fall out this bad before. Any comments would be great as this is now adding to my anxiety. Thanks. Leah.
