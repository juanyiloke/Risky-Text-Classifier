When i was between about 11-16 I was molested by my brother. At first I didn't know it was wrong, but I did feel uncomfortable and cry when my brother molested me. I realized it was wrong after a while, but I was afraid to stop him because I felt like it was my fault when he was molesting me and I felt my family and friends would be disgusted with me if they found out and I was afraid of my brother telling anyone. Also even though my brother has put me through so much absolute hell, I still don't want my family to hate him. My little brother and him still have a good relationship and I don't want to put my family through any trouble I feel like that would be selfish of me. I'm 20 now and the sexual abuse has stopped, but it has always left me with serious emotional issues. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about it. Anyway, now that you know the backstory here's my problem; I can't sleep in my room anymore because a lot of the sexual abuse occurred in there. I get sick when i spend time in there and I can't sleep well in there at all. I sleep on the couch a lot and it makes my parents angry. They always say "you have a perfectly good bed, you don't need to sleep on the damn couch!" and reactions to that affect. I want to make them understand why I can't sleep in there but i'm just not sure if i'm ready to tell them the reason why. I'm at a total loss of what to do, any suggestions on what on earth I should do?
