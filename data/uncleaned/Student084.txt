What if i pcik the wrong course.by CDanielsIv'e always wanted to go to university, ever since i started school, and that hasn't changed. I definitely want to go to university.I'm happy with the university I've applied for and have an interview for the course I've applied for. I'm about to sit my final A level examinations in a few weeks. However, i'm terrified, utterly terrified that iv'e applied for a course that i'm not going to enjoy. Everyone says pick something you love, but i don't "love" anything, i kind of just think everything is okay. I would like to do a variety of courses at the university but i know you have to pick one (joint honors is an option i guess) but iv'e already applied. Iv'e thought for months and each of the possible courses have scared me and in the end i told my family all of the options and then went with the one they thought would be best. I just don't want to get to university and then find out i don't like my course and i'm stuck with my only option to be wait it out for a year, get 9k debt and then start over again. Iv'e been depressed throughout college and it's hard to find what i "love" So i don't know what to do.Any help would be greatly appreciated, my college doesn't seem to offer much help. All they say is " It's up to you, no one can make the decision for you." I know that. But i just want to know what i can do now.
