Asthma, Controlled? I was diagnosed with Asthma when I was in the army just over 10yrs ago,it was during combat runs wearing full gear that it would affect me, make me wheeze and hyper-ventilate.I still like to keep fit now, by running and going to the gym, but I find it very hard, because when I get into it heavily for a couple of weeks, I end up with a bad chest cold which lasts ages, then my fitness takes a dive and I lose interest, but I always go back to it with the same result.Maybe I have exercise induced Asthma.Whenever I go to the Asthma clinic, there's not really much that I can tell them and I leave with the same inhalers.They have never gave me a peak flow chart or anything to really proove that I'm in control or not, Asthma is hard to talk to someone about because it is hard to know how good or bad it is.How can I get it in control, and be able to exercise continuously without following the same path over and over? And as I get older, keeping interest gets very much harder. I am only 35.
