Some advice on going to the hospital please *somewhat urgent* A little unsure I have a belting chest infection at the moment (my doctor said it sounds like its somewhere between my airways and actual lungs), coughing up a fair bit of bloody phlegm but not a whole lot of anything else but have a violent cough. I saw my GP yesterday and was prescribed amoxicillin and a tapered course of prednisolone. My usual asthma tightness has eased off, but I am increasingly feeling awful - my chest hurts, between my shoulder blades hurt, I feel completely out of it, I seem to be getting shorter of breath easier than I was and I feel like I'm drowning in the phlegm which lives in my lungs when I try lay down despite being completely drained. I'm sleeping with 4 pillows to try keep myself propped up which seems to be making no difference whatsoever. If anything, I feel worse now than I did when I started with the infection.Getting to my question now - if my asthma seems to have settled down but I still feel even worse this early on, is it worth going to A&E, especially if I have a bad history of previous admissions due to my asthma and/or chest infections? I am still normal coloured just about, if there's anything difference, I am noticeably paler than usual but no blueness/greyness/anything like that.
