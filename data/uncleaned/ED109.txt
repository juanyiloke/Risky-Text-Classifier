Another nightToday I got off early from work because of bad weather. I was so happy. I wanted to come home, lay down and watch movies and just relax. Instead I ended up going to a fast food restaurant and then to the grocery to store to get some more food. I came home and immediately wanted to go to sleep, but I couldn't because I needed to throw up. I threw up and eventually I threw up blood. This has happened to me a few times. I am starting to get worried that something is seriously wrong. Should I be worried? Is this normal? I have informed my doctor of this and he said that it could be a tear in my esophagus and that it can heal on its own, but I am still scared. How do you keep yourself from bingeing? I there a way to keep yourself from going over that point of no return? I need help!!
