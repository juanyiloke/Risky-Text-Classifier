Facts About MeHello all. I am new to the forums. I have bipolar. I have been working (seriously) to control it for just over a year now. I want to share this list I just wrote because for the past 10 years I couldn't say one of these facts out loud. I am still not ready to do that. I don't know how many of the posts here begin with something positive. But I want to share this with you out there because if you are struggling know there is hope. You too can find love for yourself. Know it is a process. Know that even though I don't know you I empathise with you. And I care for you.Every one of these facts is real. I deserve to acknowledge them and there is no shame in saying them. Maybe one day out loud.
