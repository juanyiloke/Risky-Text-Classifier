ÊWorking holiday visa to CanadaHello. I am new hereI am a Japanese citizen and I have a working holiday visa to Canada. Today, I talked to my psychiatrist about it and he said that it is risky because there will not be anybody who can see the difference in my daily life. He mentioned it is difficult for schizophrenics to recognize the onset of relapse on their own.ÊI am disappointed to hear that.. I feel like I am trapped and imprisoned , being unable to do what I want to do because of my illness.So I 'd like to ask if there is anybody who works abroad or lives abroad all alone. I would really appreciate if you could give me some advice on this...Thanks,cornemuse
