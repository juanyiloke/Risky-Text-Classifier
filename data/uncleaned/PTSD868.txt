ÊPTSD agonyHere is the 'agony'. I have an online friend that I have known since 2003. She has PTSD from childhood(she is 32). She has never told me what it is from, and I have never asked.Anyway, Her push/pull behavior is classic. She will go back n' forth, between wanting me in her life, to cutting me off.She will also tell me from time to time, F-off, that something is none of my business, or that I know nothing about her(after eleven years, that is impossible).Then she goes on a trip with her controlling boyfriend. Her boyfriend even threatened me a couple weeks ago. Then when recently told her what he said, she apparently told him to back off. He is very insecure.Three months ago, she left him because of their continued arguing and moved 1,000km.How are they going to repair their relationship being 1,000km apart. Sure she has PTSD. But, they are putting the nail in the coffin to their relationship.
