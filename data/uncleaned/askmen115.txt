CareerAdvice-Please only helpful responses2012-05-27, 12:29 PMI'm looking for honest and detailed responses. If you have been terminated from a professional position before; please respond to this post. I am also looking for responses from HR professionals. In 2010, I was terminated from a 3 month long position. I was providing administrative support to a professional corporate executive that was known for offending people. I knew the job (and his personality) was not for me but I tried to stick it out a bit longer. Anyways, I was terminated. Although the administrator informed me that she would provide a professonal recommendation for me in most cases.Since this position was only for three months and shortly after I was termed, I started working long term temporary positons..do I really need to mention this position on my resume and application? I see a difference between the two since an application is a legal document. However they do not always make you fill out one.ÊIf they do not pick up on something negative and realize I was terminated from this position, HR might believe I will leave after 3 months after working this position. I have an interview coming up and I really need to know what to do. Honest sincere responses only please.
