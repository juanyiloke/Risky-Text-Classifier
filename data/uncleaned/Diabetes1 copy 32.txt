Variability in morning readingsI was wondering what the normal range of fasting readings people get is, and how it can vary. The reason is that this morning, at about 6.45 my reading was 8.4, which is the highest for several months. At 7.30 I took it again and it was a much more reasonable 6.6. The only difference was about 2 sips of a sugar free drink and 45 minutes looking at the internet. Is a 1.8 difference in 45 minutes normal? My normal readings are from about 5.8 to 7.2, with a mean of about 6.5. (I do all the stats - histograms, SDs, means etc - just waiting to get to 512 readings to start doing Fourier transforms on it!)
