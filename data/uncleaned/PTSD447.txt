 Any way to react less intense to others pain/emotion?I've spent a lot of time giving others advice and support, and basically severely neglecting my own pressing issues, worsening symptoms and pain.Spending hours even whole days, addressing others problems.I need to put a stop to it if i'm gonna have a chance of dealing with C-PTSD.I mean, as a guy, I cry a shocking amount watching movies, not that i've got a problem with crying, just react too strongly. Or even seeing/hearing a baby cry, can get to me.I can detach, but that puts me back to where i'm trying to move away from.Does the intense emotional reaction tamper down over with therapy?Thanks.
