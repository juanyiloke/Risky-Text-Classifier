Weight loss..Hi,Im 16, from the Isle of Man.So, around 18 months ago I was border line anorexic, 39kg at 14 and 5"6 ish. My mum noticed what was going on eventually, and told my pediatrician. And it went from there really.Pediatricians, counsellors, dieticians..Im now around 50kg, last time I was weighed. I got discharged from my dietician a few months ago, because she thought I was at an okay weight. But recently, I've been getting up late and missing breakfast and basically just not making the effort I should really. Maybe because of a boy being a but of a d*ck and messing with my feelings..Its not that I dont eat, because I do. But my parents keep nagging at me and saying Im looking too thin and that they've seen "more fat on a chip".Personally, I think now that I am 16 it should really be my decision what weight I am. I get that they are worried, but I just want to be the weight I want. But i cant.I do want to gain weight and be able to wear a bikini, and not get the mickey take out of me for my small boylike frame. But, I just find it hard.Any advice or anything would be much appreciated   thank youu
