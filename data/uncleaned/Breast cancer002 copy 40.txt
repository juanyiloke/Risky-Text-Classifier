HAIR AFTER CHEMO !!¥	Hi Ladies¥	I was in the class of 2010 !! 5 years on and doing very well. I know it is so daunting when you start this journey but it's amazing how quick it goes !!¥	I lost my hair with Chemo, since it grew back I have never really been that happy with it.. Tamoxifan has not helped and it's quite fine and thinning - especially on the crown. I have spent an absolute fortune on hair products in last 4 years and whilst some have been better than others, none I gave been really happy with. Whikst looking at Marks and Spencer Website I saw a 3 Step System from company called Swell. They did a trial size for £23.00 for shampoo, conditioner & root complex. So I bought it not really expecting a lot of difference. But I am so pleased with it. It took 3-4 washes for my hair to look better. It has much more volume and stays in the style for longer. My hair also looks thicker at the roots. It is not cheap but for me it has improved my hair. You can only buy it in certain M&S but can order from website. Amazon also sell it. Thought I would just pass this on. ¥	Regards¥	DEBRA
