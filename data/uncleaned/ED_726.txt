unsure what to doI've been cutting my meals down even more as of late, as well as nightly exercise to the point where I'm ready to pass out. I was talking to my boyfriend about it recently and he brought up the future affects of starving myself and overexertion on an empty stomach. I told him I already knew about them, but I was just so desperate to lose weight, but he came back with "well, then what's the point in me planning a future with someone who doesn't care about theirs?" I got really depressed after that and in retaliation I exercised again after already exerting my energy earlier in the evening, and today I ate way less food, on top of another intense workout. I didn't tell him how it affected me, but I think maybe I should have. I feel kinda guilty about retaliating by upping the efforts to lose weight. Although I feel like I'm getting nowhere. I've been hovering around the same weight for months now, even though I'm eating less and less and exercising a lot. And I feel like it's not as big a deal as my boyfriend's making out of it. My parents don't seem to think it's a big problem. I haven't started losing hair or anything. My periods have been infrequent, but that's been since before I even started skipping meals. I'm just a fatty and I need to do what I can to lose the weight. But when I try to explain that to him he always says I'm a perfect weight, but I know I'm huge and he's just trying to make me feel better. I don't know how to get him to see that, and admit it to my face instead of lying and saying I'm pretty when I'm obviously ugly and fat. Help? :/
