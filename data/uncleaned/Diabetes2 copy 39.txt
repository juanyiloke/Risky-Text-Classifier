Please help glucose in urine but not in blood and pain in stomach  6  Hello So I have been having pain in my pelvic area for the past week that has got progressively worse! I have previous history of recurrent miscarriages and have also suffered from pelvic inflammatory disease so just thought maybe it was something going on down there until I started experiencing dizziness, headaches, nausea, pins and needles in my hands and arm, pain in my breast and the pain started going under my ribs!! So I went to my GP who sent me for blood test basically testing everything thyroid, diabetes (I fasted for this) hormones ect.Te results came back on Friday with high hormone level, prolactin levels and low folate levels. She has requested I get an ultrasound scan in the week but over this weekend the pain became worse and started to spread to my back!! So I went to the out of hours today who did a urine sample that showed high levels of glucose in my urin, high PH and white blood cells?? So if I'm not diabetic as my blood glucose levels were fine could this mean something is wrong with my kidneys? I have googled my symptoms and after diabetes it's kidney disease, does anyone know anything about this? Or had the same?
