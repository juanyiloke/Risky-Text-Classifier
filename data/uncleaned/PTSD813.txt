ÊPregnant and scared for my kidOk let me start with saying i am pregnant with my 3rd child in less than 3 years. My first two are 18 months apart and this one will be 18 months from my second child as well. I have been having very paramoid feelings about everyone with my children. Im scared someone is going to physically or sexually abuse them. And i know thats a fear of evety mother but it consumes me. I dont like leaving them alone with anyone... Including my husband who is the one person i know i should trust. And this is why Im seeking some answers. It ruined my mothers marriage because she thought her husband was hurting me but he was a wonderful man from what i remember as a child. Just as my hudband is. Just as everyone in my family is. So why am i having these feelings toward everyone? Is it because Ive gotten pregnant to close together and havent let my hormones balance out? Or is it because I was hurt as a child by a close relative and Im afraid it could happen to my kids? Please give me some input before I ruin my marriege. Also my mother and grandfather have thyroid problems which i know makes you feel paranoid. Im just looking for a rational solution here.
