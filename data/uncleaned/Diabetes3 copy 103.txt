New GP AppointmentI finally got to meet my new GP today after the diabetic nurse asked me to go see him. My goodness, i love the flipping guy. It went well, we talked about all my illnessess and how we are going to work on them all etc. The only thing he has changed is i am now on 20mg Simvastatin. Not because i NEED it, it's because it is 0.3 higher than it should be and he asked if i would go on it so i don't wait for something to happen to need to be on it. His approach to everything is going to prevent long term damage with any of my issues, so not waiting around and waiting for levels to go awol or something to happen. If he thinks i need a little help then he would rather i get on the treatment etc.I told him about my slip up, i never hide them or anything. He completely understood, told me it does happen and as long as i get back on the horse it's ok. Although he has told me to try and find something which will help me to no turn to food when anxious/stressed. But he is willing to help with that as well.But otherwise, i love the guy
