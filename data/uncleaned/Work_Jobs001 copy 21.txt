Would you say its unfair?________________________________________Hi all,So I am working in my current job for last 1.5 years meaning I am on a permanent contract. I have been noticing that the management have been trying to get me somehow. The job where I work sell electronics , due to which I have developed a habit of buying new tech every week or two and selling it on the likes of Adverts/Donedeal when I am done with it. Recently I got an email saying this is a breach of my contract as I am doing the same thing as the company, selling electronics. Now I do this in my own spare time and not during the company time.Secondly I recently attended an interview for a better position in a competitor store, I was honest about it to my current employer and told them that I did attend the interview. Again this was in my own time. I didnt call in sick or went home early to accommodate the interview.So after a couple of days I heard from the management that it was also breach of my contract due to confidentiality reasons. The thing is the competitor is in the same business and obviously asked me where I work and what I do at my present job. I did tell them about it and made sure that I did not mention anything about my current employer that is NOT in the public domain.There have been several HR issues with us not getting payslips on time. We just got payslips for December two weeks back despite asking for them every week. I was getting the feeling that they are not happy that I keep asking for these.We were recently asked to give customer feedback to the management and when we did we got a reply saying that we are being negative all the time.We are constantly under pressure and every single staff member in the particular branch is going to a stressful phase, with all of us suffering from depression due to the work environment.So these reasons and the current atmosphere in work is leading me to believe that they might let me go soon due to one of the above reasons. So my question is , would any of the above would be a fair reasons/dismissal?Thank You.
