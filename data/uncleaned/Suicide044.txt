My lifeA broke insite to my existance,I've had depression and ocd since I was 15 and psoriasis since I was 21 I've probably had every therapy and medication going,I don't have a life I have an existance,I cannot bear my existance but I'm unable to do anything to harm myself as I don't have the courage and have a conscious towards my family,I've failed in every single aspect of my life school,college and my career I have nothing to offer the world sadly it's accurate to say I'm worthless and that's not me belittling myself it's fact,I've basically given up I've begun to self medicate in the last couple of weeks with a litre of vodka a night and I also consume approx 50g of tobacco a day I'd say it's also a kind of self harm as I now experience chest pains and it makes me feel good to know I'm damaging myself.
