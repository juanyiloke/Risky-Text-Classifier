Career women - avoiding the b***h clicheHi ladies!I could really use some advice at the moment, I'm in tears after work again today...so I don't think I'm doing it quite right. I've read some great threads here in the past so I'm hoping some of you might have experience in this area that could help me....I seem to have trouble with maintaining balance in my working relationships. I'm starting to see a pattern, so the problem could very well be me.When you are female, have a soft voice and are by nature quite shy - how do you progress in your career without forcing yourself to play a role?How can you be helpful - without being a pushover?And how can you be assertive - without people branding you as a bitch?How do you stop being too sensitive, and stop letting what other people think of you matter so much?Do other women have these problems too? Or is it just me?
