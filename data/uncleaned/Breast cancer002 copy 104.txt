Was all going so well¥	Just out of hospital following a weeks stay¥	it all started to go horribly wrong last Monday, 3 weeks post mastectomy and LD reconstruction everything was starting to feel really good, all wounds healed and no problems, short trip and chemo arranged and feeling positive.¥	last Monday evening started to have pain around the new breast and spiked a temp, GP called and advised admission. 3 days of IV antibiotics not working and starting to feel really unwell, surgeon decided the implant had to be removed and the infection gradually resolved.¥	at home now and feel really low, scared to start chemo in case of further infection, wondering what else could go wrong¥	Anybody else been through this sort of thing, or any positive thoughts great fully received.¥	Fiona
