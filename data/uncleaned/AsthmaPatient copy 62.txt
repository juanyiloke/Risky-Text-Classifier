Asthma, chest infection or allergy? For the past 5 yers, I have driven to the Algarve in Portugal, to spend 6 winter months there.Every year, within 2 weeks of arrival, I have bad breathing problems making even walking difficult. I have to visit the local clinic where I am put on a nebuliser and given antibiotics, which seems to clear thing. The worst part of this is the inability to lay down at night without coughing up gunge, and therefore have to sit and sleep as best you can. I have none of this problem at home in the UK. I rarely even have a cold.!! Does anyone have any idea what is causes this and maybe know a way to avoid it ( Please don't tell me not to go there!!) Thanks MCC
