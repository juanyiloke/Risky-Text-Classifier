English Identity?My name is Noel Thompson and I am at Kingston University and currently conducting a study into Cornish identity. The study is trying to discover the strength and depth of Cornish national identity, through an online questionnaire. It is in three parts and takes about 8 minutes altogether. It requires no personal information. I need as wide a range of people from Cornwall as possible, so please log on if you have the time.If you have any questions on the study, feel free to contact me at noel-thompson@hotmail.co.uk or if you have any concerns about the study, please contact Dr Annie Hughes at the Kingston University geography department.The questionnaire can be found at cornishidentitysurvey.blogspot.com.Thank you,Noel Thompson
