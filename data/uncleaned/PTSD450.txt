ÊFailing a class because of PTSDRight now, today is Sunday 4/12. Tomorrow is my final exam in my Maternal nursing class and I need to score a 90%+ to pass the class. I have been getting low and so-so grades in this class from the beginning and it finally grew into a head. I have a 92% in my medical-surgical 1 class and my GPA is 3.6 (the last time I checked). I have low self-esteem but I know I know my nursing knowledge. My problem on why I am failing this class is completely based on my abuse.During my abuse, my biggest fear was to become pregnant. The first time I was abused literately happened the day after getting the talk for the first time at 5 so I automatically equated sex always leading to pregnancy. My abuser was underage and in the beginning, wasn't old enough to produce sperm. When he started producing it, I was even more terrified. Thanks to my years being abused by him, the whole process of having sex, getting pregnant, carrying the baby, and delivering it is absolutely repulsive to me. And I did not know this until I started the class. I would be triggered each class so I started tuning the professor out which prevented me from gathering notes and being able to study effectively.ÊMy classmates think that I am a inexperienced, sheltered virgin. My professor is also the nursing chairman of the program and she is very cold. I doubt she'll care. I have been studying hard but It is hard as I have to take many breaks to avoid crying, getting sick, or puking. I feel like the most pathetic nurse ever. I can handle blood and gore and everything else but I can't stand talking about making babies. Idk what I'll do if I have to sit in that class again.
