Seborrheic DermatitisI wasnt sure where to put this... but I think it might be OK here.I found out last week I have seborrheic dermatitis. Not that it really matters what the doctors chose to call it as I have being successfully treating it with selsun for years now. Amongst my social circles Im the only person that has it (or anything close to it). But what has gotten me curious is the experts reckon Im not alone and that its actually a very very common ailment, and a lot of times, remains undiagnosed for decades.Since its apparently so common I thought maybe Id ask here, does anybody else have it? Is it really that common? What are you using for it? Hows it working out? Any hints/tips or tricks to share?Ê
