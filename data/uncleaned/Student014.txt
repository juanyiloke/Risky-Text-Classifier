Should I leave uni?by nutterbutter3005Basically, I am studying to get a French and Spanish degree. I have had various personal problems, which forced me to retake my first year (I gained a 2:1 in the end) but this year I have had severe anxiety and self esteem issues and havent attended uni. The work and exams i've done in 1st semester i scraped a 2:1, but haven't handed in some of my essays this semester. I've recently started getting help for my problems but it is a bit late to pass my exams etc now and Obviously I haven't got the funding to resit another year. I have also got a placement in France next year.On the other hand, I applied for some apprenticeships and have managed to secure one with the civil service on 18,000 a year, and I have an interview for one around 20,000. would it just be the better option to give up on uni and go into a job?any advice is appreciated. Thanks
