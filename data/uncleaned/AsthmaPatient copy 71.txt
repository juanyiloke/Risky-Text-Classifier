symbicor 100/6 the doze idicator faulty?? Hi I have been taking symbicort for around 8 yrs which has been good and helped a lot.. the last two inhalers I have noticed that when it was showing 40 doses left I believe that I have not been getting the dose as on both occasion when I started my new one bad systems dissapeared within 24 hours.. my systems have been tiredness.. breathless.. weariness and just a feeling heart jumping a beat.. I am wondering if the inhalers have been faulty showing 40 doses left but could it be empty?? I wonder if anyone else has noticed this recently with there inhaler..
