  QuestionsHi, I am new to this .... every bit of it.I have had a PET scan done which showed a spot on my lung and on my liver. The oncologist said based upon the PET scan I had advanced lung cancer. They did a biopsy on the spot on my liver and it came back negative. But he still believes that it is advanced lung cancer. I am going to another doctor for a 2nd opinion and also because I just did not feel comfortable with this doctor.Has anyone else ever heard of advanced lung cancer even though the liver biopsy came back negative?
