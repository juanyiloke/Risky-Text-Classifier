Reversal surgeryHiI have been lucky to only be diagnosed with a Stage 1 rectal cancer and have had my surgery for a temporary illeostomy. I met with the surgeon this week to discuss the next stages including my reversal surgery. I was concerned regarding the possibility of incontinence following my surgery and was wondering if there were any patients who had experienced this following reversal surgery. I am selfishly concerned as I am due to get married in November and was wondering if I should delay my reversal surgery until after the wedding although I didnt want to get married with my stoma.Any advice would be greatly received.Thank you
