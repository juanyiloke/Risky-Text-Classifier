Yet another hospital apptSpent most of today up at Raigmore, at the chest clinic to have my breathing checked, SATs almost back to normal, then the memory clinic for a reprise of the stuff they did two years ago. The geniuseseses reckon it's stress. Ya think!!? I'm being referred to a psychologist*, which should be fun as I'm one myself, lol! Any bets on who will drive whom to a nervous breakdown? The idea is to measure the levels of depression and find ways to deal with it that don't involve happy pills, which I refuse to take.Oh, and I've mislaid another 1.5 kilos somewhere in the past two weeks.
