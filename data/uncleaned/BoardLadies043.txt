Woman/Women That You Most Admire?I thought it might be a nice idea to start a thread exploring the women the women in the ladies lounge most admire. Why you are drawn to them and what do they represent for you? The two women that I would have to say stick out to me most would be the activist Aung San Suu Kyi and the author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. They are different women in what they do but they are both to me captivating. It was only through chancing about a film about Aung San Suu Kyi, after previously having glanced over an article reporting about her, that I discovered who she was. I admired so much her strength, will and yet grace in such adversity, frightening adversity. I am doing Americanah as part of my FYP. I thoroughly enjoyed the book but when I searched on YouTube for interviews that she had done I was even more obsessed with her. She's a brilliant, intelligent speaker and a great writer. I just want to emulate her. I must have watched every interview she has been in. For me those women really stand out and I highly respect them.  What about everyone else?
