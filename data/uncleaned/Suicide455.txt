Quick way to go…LomdonerDon’t know where to start…Depression/bi-polar just zapped the life from me. Thinking about suicide for few years (26 now) but only recently took it from a thought to action.I want to kill myself using a method that will be:1. Painless2. Non-hazardous to others3. Easy to achieveI saw a post regarding disposable BBQ method; Have my fave meal, bottle of Hennessy, hot bath and some Lana Del Rey.Life’s pretty shit, can’t find work, pushed away everyone so find myself alone and on verge of becoming homeless (which is the last nail for me) . I need a reliable method. What should I do? Has anyone tried Co2 method? Are there any other ways?Thinking of the gas boiler but don’t want to cause some explosion.It’s kinda strange, I thought no point of mopping around in my last days so surprisingly I don’t feel so sad. Maybe it’s just the relief that the end is near. Fucked up when you want to die for so long you finally want to give life a try but it’s already too late.
