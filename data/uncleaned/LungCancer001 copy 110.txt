Scared of this cancerBeen reading through a lot of the signatures and scaring myself silly.What are the benefits of meditation/ visualization techniques in getting better?Have been reading every single book on cancer I can get my hands on and the best thing I believe I can do for myself is to eat sensibly and take more exercise. Before my diagnosis , I had a very poor diet.Reading one book at present about the mind /body connection and how repressed emotions can influence the onset of cancer. What does everyone think of this?Also has anyone heard of Louise Hay? She 'cured' herself of cancer , after finding out she had it, she had a diet of pureed cabbage for a couple of months and the cancer went into remission.Going for my first session of chemo tomorrow - wish me luck!!!
