New to forum - losing my wayHi everyone - I am new to this forum and new in general to trying to assess my life. I'm a relatively successful person and by most people's accounts, I'm easy to get along with, honest, upstanding citizen that tries to do the right thing.At the same time, over the last few years I've been drinking alcohol excessively, working too much, and having sex outside my marriage (sometimes fueled by the alcohol). My marriage is suffering because of it, obviously, though she doesn't even know about the sex. It is just clear that there is a problem.All of this makes me feel terrible about myself. I have very high standards for myself, but I choose to fail them all the time. I'm so disappointed that I hurt my wife - she is a good person who loves me very much and wants the best for me and for us.I don't really know what I'm looking for. I am not someone that people would think is very emotional or depressed or even stressed. I have a very relaxed persona. All of this is going on and people don't even know.I'm not sure what I should do....so I just wanted to share and learn and talk.Thanks for reading.
