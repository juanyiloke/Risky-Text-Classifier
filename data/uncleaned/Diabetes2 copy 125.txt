Update of previous forum discussion re high blood sugarSince I last write on the forum about my concerns about my constantly raised blood sugars things have changed so I wanted to let all the people who responded what the situation is. I was in hospital on an unrelated matter (mild heart attack) and my blood sugats were tested 4 times per day and they were never below 11.8 and went up to 22.9. The ward staff were very concerned and referred me to the diabetes consultant who saw me on Friday just before I was discharged.He said that contrary to what my GP said, I do need to be testing every day, at least once but at the moment whilst it is so high it has to be tested 4 times per day and the hospital have given me the relevant number of testing strips.The consultant has also told me that, contrary to what a number of people on the forum have told me, poorly controlled blood sugars are not always caused by too much sugary food and drink. in my case the raised sugar levels are due to the long term use of steroids (because of uveitis) and the particular form  of Type 2 diabetes I have which can cause quick deterioration. I have 2 other friends with type 2 diabetes who had to start using insulin after only 2 years as a disagnosed diabetic. It looks as though I may soon have to go onto insulin myself if the blood sugars. does not start getting to safe levels. In my case after talking over my medical history he feels it is likely that my blood sugars are particularly sensitive to illness ie if I have an infection they will go up in addition to the diabetes getting worse - it has nothing to do with what I am eating/drinking
