GAD and Intrusive ThoughtsHello! I'm a woman in her early 20's. For a number of years I have suffered from generalised anxiety with long periods of depression. I had a good couple of years, but this year the hammer's really come down on me and I've started to struggle, especially with fears about my health, and trying to deal with my social anxiety. In the past couple of months I've started having intrusive thoughts, usually hyper sexual discomfort towards *anything*, from animals, children, relatives or objects, lasting from an hour to two days, and I was hoping to find some sort of discussion about how you guys deal with yours.ÊMine usually happen like this: I'll be 'fine', then I see or hear The Thing, my brain races to WHAT IF a) you're turned on by this? b) you acted on that thought you don't have, but are afraid you have? c) What if you're like this for the rest of your life??? Then my stomach drops and I feel like throwing up. I get that awful groinal response (which doesn't go away because I'm still so afraid) and it's driving me up the wall, even though my Logical Brain knows that when I'm not interested in doing anything like what my anxiety says I might do (even though my thoughts are never specific, just sort of...OH NO). I get shaky, and nauseous, and I often get it when I'm alone. Ironically my anxiety is driving a physical barrier between me and my S/O, and this is just making it worse, because I think "What if you think about the thing during...?"ÊI'm new here, and hope this is the right thread. I know intrusive thoughts are usually related to OCD but I've only ever been diagnosed with GAD so I don't know. I'm currently not seeing anyone, due to a bad experience a few years back with a GP making me feel uncomfortable with sharing my anxiety. I'm trying to get used to talking about it, so I'd love any responses. What do you guys think or do to help with your intrusive thoughts??
