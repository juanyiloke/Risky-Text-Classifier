Two steps forward one step backThis is my first post and I actually just joined. I have been struggling with body image and an eating disorder for over a year now. It got pretty bad at one point, and the only reason I stopped purging was because I started to notice some side effects that really really scared me (mainly really short/irregular periods, but also irregular breathing, etc.). I don't really have anyone else to talk with. My friends don't understand and most of them don't know about my poor self image - some of the latter even joke about making themselves sick after eating. Like I said, I stopped purging, and I have been eating better and exercising. I feel like if I eat one bad meal or skip one day at the gym, though, that I will gain so much weight. I am also 6 ft tall and I hate it - I always feel gigantic. And people will use "big" synonymously with "tall". Somedays I feel really good and I'm like "to heck with my body image. I am who I am and I should love me for me." but then other days I'm like "no one will ever want to be with this. I am disgusting." I just don't know how to make those latter days fewer and far between. I did have a slip up last night. I just turned 21 and I'm afraid that drinking will make me gain a lot of weight. Not to mention alcohol and good decisions and positive self-image don't tend to go well together. Is anyone out there struggling with this? I just feel like I'm disgusting sometimes... I don't want to feel that way. I want to work my way towards recovery but somedays it feels like these feelings are never going to leave me alone. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or can anyone just relate? No one else seems to understand and I feel embarassed and ashamed talking about it because I am a Pre-med student and I know all the bad things that can happen from these unhealthy behaviors. But I can't help those feelings....
