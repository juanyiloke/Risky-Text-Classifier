Life after chemotherapyWell the chemotherapy (12 cycles FOLFOX) and the SIRT procedure are all done and they do appear to have done their job quite well. The really big liver met is down from 55mm to 13 mm now with similar shrinking of the other mets. Unfortunately despite it being a good result, as expected, the number and spread of the mets mean that I'm still not able to have a resection and, to be honest, probably never will. But I'm good with that, I'll take the extra time the treatment has bought me.So they've cut me loose to recover for the next two months and then they'll scan again. Much as I am enjoying not being poisoned every couple of weeks I am feeling a bit lost as it had become such a familiar routine over the last six months.I was wondering though if other people here have been in the same situation and if it is possible to have further treatment such as more chemo except with different drugs if (OK let's be honest here, when) the cancer starts to grow again?
