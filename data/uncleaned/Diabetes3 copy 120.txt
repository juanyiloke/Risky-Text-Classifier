Six month reviewHad my HbA1c blood test a couple of weeks a go and received a letter yesterday with a single sentence. "Your blood test was satisfactory, no need to change your medication." I was a bit miffed to say the least, that they would dismiss the effort I put in and provide no feedback. So this morning I rang the surgery and got through to the administrator and asked if I could have my number. Quite a pleasant surprise with a 38, she said that maybe I could come off my medication. I pointed out that it was because of my insulin that I had my sugars under control. "Oh you're on insulin! Oh......oh....oh...can you callback in 30 minutes?" When I called back she asked me how often I hypo'd and how low did I go? I told her I don't and apart from one 3.8 my bloods are controlled. Her reply was "phew....just carry on then!" I was left a little confused, but thought sod it! So I celebrated with a Mars bar followed by a brisk walk
