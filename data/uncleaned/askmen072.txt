Company Purchased: Changing Careers at 40+?2013-02-18, 06:00 PMHello my fellow AMers.....Strange turn of events in the last two weeks. Our company was purchased and the new executive team is releasing many of us with a small severance........Have any of you changed careers in your 40s? Any advice or recommendations on career counseling?I'm in the rare position of being single, with my only child in the college years......so I'm considering doing something different....
