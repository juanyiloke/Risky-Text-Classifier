  Metastasized lung caMy primary ca is/was colon almost 3 years ago. I'm thinking now I should feel lucky I've lasted this long without major complications, but to discover now that it has metastasized to my lungs is not the news I was hoping for. Difficult to feel grateful since I know so many souls much younger than me have succumbed to this insidious disease, but I'm trying, in spite of 3 grown children who are having their own difficulties right now with this very recent diagnosis.I'm debating whether to go for another round of killer chemotherapy - this one being Folfiri and Avastin. I don't know a thing about either component but since I had no quality of life for 6 months while undergoing chemo for my colon ca I am dubious at best about signing on for another course.I would much more prefer to attack my diagnosis with alternatives but have no idea what those might be. If anyone out there in this club none of us signed up for, and don't want to be a part of, has any suggestions or experiences to share, I would really appreciate reading about them.I am in the Portland, OR area and would also like to know if there are any support groups locally - if anyone has that kind of information too. God grant me the wisdom to see clearly what you intend for me and what actions I can take to maximize your love and guidance for each of us souls in this major challenge.Thank you all.
