ÊAll a bit of a shockJust back from trauma therapy. Tough one. Really tough one. Psychotherapist realised that the adult me doesn't know about the prevalence of something and so we looked on the internet and found info and info is there and it's all confusing and I want to step off from this spinning planet right now , just for a while, and it's all rather overwhelming right now. I don't know. Confused. Why do people do bad things? Why do they do them? Why doesn't the adult me know things as the young me needs a strong adult right now. Can't remember last time so dazed. Sorry xx
