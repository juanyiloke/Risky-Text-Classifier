Anybody lost their job due to anxiety?Has anybody lost their job due to anxiety? If so, how did things turn out?I'm being pressured to go back but in no way feel ready and also part of me never wants to go back there as if I do I fear nothing will ever change as thats where my first panic attack happened and I'm very aware of that in my mind. Whilst in the short term I feel going back there will make me initially better I feel in the long run it wont and I always end up back in this situation. Just wanted to hear from anybody else who's lost their job and how things have turned out for them
