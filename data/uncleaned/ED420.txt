Êcould i have an eating disorder.I dont know if i do or not but anyway.ÊI am constanly thinking about food and i hate eating and if i do eat i feel SUPER guilty and also if i eat i feel like i have to exercise to get rid of it. I cant eat normally i am either binge eating or starving myself and i havent made myself throw up but i have tried and failed. there is more but i find it very difficult to explain. I know you guys cant diagnose but i am just wondering if anyone experiences anything similar.
