Diabetic Review?I'm just wondering if there's a "norm" for diabetic reviews. I was diagnosed last May, but couldn't get to see the DN until July. I assume this was my "first " review? Due to my cholesterol being high (6.4) as well as my BG (7.9), and her thinking I had keytones in my urine (this turned out to be wrong), I had another hba1c 6 weeks later, which came back at 6.3. Then I was asked to go back in October and my hba1c, cholesterol & urine were all checked. My hba1c was 5.5, my cholesterol 5, my urine was "fine". I am following LCHF. Then last week I had a letter asking me to make an appointment, they've only done a hba1c test, they said a urine test was not needed as it was fine in October! My cholesterol wasn't going to be checked either. Then as I was walking out of the door she said, I'll see you in July, bring a water sample. I'm just wondering what should be checked and how often. A colleague at work has just been for his review where they've weighed him, checked his hba1c, cholesterol and urine, he said he's not due back until next year. I think my boss thinks I'm trying to wangle extra time off. I'm just wondering what's right and what's wrong?
