difficulty in recoveryi'm 13 years old and last week i went to visit an eating disorders clinic. they confirmed that i was anorexic and had an eating disorder. they said that i'm not allowed to play sport and i have to have 3 meals and 3 snacks. i am reallyy struggling because everytime i eat i am constanlty obsessed with calories and how much fat. i used to love milk and now i just refuse it and im really worried becaue i want to recover bbut not gain weight. i currenlty weigh 38kg ive lot 1kg since last week and i was weighed yesterday. i am finding it really difficult and i have no energy and im always freezing cold. i need some advice for how to recover in the first week or 2 weeks. (sorry for really long message!)
