"female problem"I'm having an embarrassing "issue" and I wondering/hoping some advice.I've been on my period and wear pads, I think I've finished now so I've taken my pad off, but I'm in a lot of pain down there. Its really sore, dry and itchy. When I go to the toilet it hurts and hurts to wipe it.I'm in the middle of moving house, we have family here and the nearest pharmacy is 2 miles away, I don't drive and have no one to take me as everyone is busy, and in too embarrassed to ask any way. I have asked my husband but we won't take me yet.Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to sooth it? I think I have some vaceline in a box upstairs, is that safe to put on it?I'm desperate to relieve the pain, I can't walk or sit comfortably.
