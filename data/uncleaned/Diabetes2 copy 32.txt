what is the trigger?? Need some advice  5  I ahve just been told I have diabetes 2,mi blood/Glucose levels over the last three months have been 4.8,4.8,and 4.7. I got a letter from the practice tell inf me to go and see one of there nurse,s I went in and she told me that the doctor had made me diabete,s two, after some talking she kind of said to me that she did not agree.. I am at the moment going to try and control it with diet, I was offered a pill but declined it. What I dont know is what is the b/g level that tips you over. Do I need to get a meter to check my bloods, and I am starting to excersie on a bike as my gym chappies tell me its the fast way to loose a tyre around your waist..Just what the hell can I Eat is another one, there,s all the good fats and the bad fats. I have had none of the sytems, had my feet checked ect all good to go. Down side is my mother had diabetes 2 for 33yrs.. Just need advice which way to go here, any help thank you in advance. there seems to be a lot of rubbish about.
