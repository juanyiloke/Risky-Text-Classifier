Private Halls vs. Shared Houseby HandmadeTurnipMy application for a room in halls for my second year has recently been rejected so I'm now at a bit of a loss as to what to do. I couldn't afford to move away from home for my first year so as a result, I don't really have anyone I can arrange to live with for next year. The few people I know already have their own social circles outside of our course. I don't really want to have to spend another year at home so it seems I'm left with two options; book a room in private halls or find a room in a shared house. Both have their drawbacks though so I'm not sure which would be best. I haven't heard great things about private halls and I'm worried about the people I might end up with, at least in university-owned halls you're guaranteed to be with people from your particular university. As for finding a shared house, it seems like it would be a lot of hassle and I'd be worried about ending up with a group of people who are already friends and feeling like the odd one out.Any advice?
