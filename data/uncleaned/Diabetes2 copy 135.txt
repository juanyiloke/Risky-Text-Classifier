Type 2 and LyxumiaHi I have been Diabetic Type 2 for 10 years now it runs in my family with my Dad and my oldest brother having it as well.I have just had my yearly blood test and been told I need to change my medication and the doctor would like me to go on to Lyxumia although I dont fancy the injecting part I guess I might as well get used to it for when I upgrade to Type 1. Thing is have any of you tried it how easy was it for you to get used to injecting and any side affects etc. I know its new out there only about 2 years old since being passed so I am concerned. Sue
