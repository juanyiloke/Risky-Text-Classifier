 Staying Fit While We're .....F**ked, in the head, basically What ye reckon ....?Ye know what it's like. Ye get PTSD. Ye whole existence gets sucked into ye own head. Ye end up in a corner, wishing everything outside ye corner would leave ye the f**k alone.Did ye know that Rabies ~ of all things ~ is also known as " The Running Disease " ? That's because the animal ~ not having access to anyone capable of telling it WTF is going on, simply follows its instinct, and tries to run away from the shit going on in it's head.Did You run? I know I sure as hell did. Away from the place I got it. Then just plain away from People. I now live, as pretty much a recluse, in the middle of nowhere. I go into town, for a few hours, once a week. Half those hours I probably spend wandering from my base, in the pub, to various shops and back. More exercise than I get in a week then But, what about the Rest of my week? Largely sat here. Getting older. Waiting for my Heart Attack!Cardiac Arrest doesn't bother me. Death doesn't bother me. (Yeah; F**king rich, coming from a guy who's in the state he is now, because he thought he was just about to Die! ) But, really; It's my Dogs. I love them more than life itself. If I die .....So; Treadmill of life? What ye reckon? I Do know ye shouldn't exercise first thing! Hell no! Up at seven thirty? F**k yeself around? Dead by ten thirty! F**k That!I just read that little bursts are better too. Five minutes, here and there. Rather than a one off, daily marathon.I'm seriously considering getting a treadmill. I could put a decent track on You Tube. Drag my mill over. Walk in time to the music as I look at the screen. What's to not like about that?Do it while the kettle boils. The dinner micro waves. The Dogs eat their dinners. All those times we'd other wise just stand around.And, let's face it; We DO 'stand around', don't we? Preoccupation of the head slows the body down. We stay at home. How many of ye longer termmers are relating to what I'm saying here, eh?F**k this! I used to be physically active as all hell! I'd basically drag my Dog all over the place, miles and miles, just going about my day to day peregrinations through the city. Dog was Ripped! Couldn't have been bad myself.Now? No where to go. Got a computer and a beer gut. Dogs drag me up the f**king track and back. Four hundred yards. That's me for the day.F**k this. I have a clutcher just waiting in the queue to reach me! Tread Mill? Rowing machines are for c***s and rowers. Exercise Bike? Get a f**king bike! Go somewhere!What ye reckon? I'm getting too much like Elvis. I'd rather be back to
