Swollen arm/breast is it normal?¥	This morning I noticed how different in size my right breast and under armpit/arm is compared to my left side. I feel it all the time like when I hang my arm down against my body it is different to my left side and doesn't go flat against me. is this normal, surgery was 2 months ago or should I be concerned? Movement in the right arm is pretty good tho it's always tender when I get up in the mornings.  Don't want to be moaning all the time but I got a bit of a shock just now when I looked in the mirror. Oh and also have had pain for days in left neck/shoulder as I'm using left arm more than before to compensate for right side :-(( Otherwise things are ok and sun is shining! Xx
