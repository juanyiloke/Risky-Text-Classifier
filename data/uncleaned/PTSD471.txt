ÊGeminiNZ's pain-in-the-neck threadI feel miserable and thought it might help to set up my own personal misery thread for over the holidays, so now i can whine and complain as often as i need to without cluttering up other people's threads with my stuff.Have so much pain in my neck (around the disc), and in my arm (referred pain from nerve compression). Feel like i'm losing my mind. Doing all i can with ice packs and meds, but they barely take the edge off. And it's triggering a lot of stuff from childhood - being in pain, being alone with it, having to comfort myself, etcetera.Keep reminding myself i made it through the last disc injury so i can make it through this one, too. But i'm not very convincing - especially as last time was a contributing factor in the breakdown that led to being referred for therapy.ÊHave stopped talking/emailing about it with people around me as there's nothing practical anyone can do and that seems to make them uncomfortable or dismissive. Tired of being told to have a lovely xmas; this time of year is never lovely and being in constant pain is not doing anything to improve it.Still no word on physio, which means there's no chance it will start this side of xmas. Because of the stat hols, the very earliest it could begin now is the 29th, but no notification yet means that's unlikely. Need it, and also dreading it.Also dreading impending contact from one of my abusers, plus my child goes on holiday for five days from Boxing Day.ÊI guess at least things can't really get worse.
