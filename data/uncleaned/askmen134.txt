Bicoastal Situation2012-03-13, 08:55 AMHey all, I'm in a bit of a pickle, so I could use as much professional advice as possible...I recently moved to LA from NY to shop around a feature film I produced. I've been making a lot of headway with it, which is great by all means. My NY job allowed me to take my job out west by working from apartment, which is slowly driving me CRAZY. I made it a goal to find a more challenging job, with better clients, better pay, and more opportunity for growth (which my company doesn't have). That said, one day I applied for a job I really wanted in New York, while applying all over LA.I recently came back to NY to visit family and my luck would have it that the NIGHT before I head back to LA, I get a call from that NY company and participate in a phone interview. They liked me a lot and the interview was successful. I was then invited for an in-office interview with the Head of Development. I accepted and consequently extended my NY trip by a week to make it happen.ÊThis is the kind of job that exceeds all of my criteria. My only issue is that, in the pit of my stomach, I feel like there was still "stuff to do" in LA, like travel and apply around more for jobs out there. I'm not crazy about LA and I can still shop my movie from NY (it's gotten to that stage). I'm just nervous because I know this is the right job for my and my career, however, I feel like if I should get the job and move back to NY, I would be leaving LA too soon. Please keep in mind that aside from shopping my film, there's not much LA has to offer and I'm not very crazy about the city itself.ÊCan I get some thoughts/advice? I'm only 24 and have never been faced with a challenge like this before.It Is What It Is.
