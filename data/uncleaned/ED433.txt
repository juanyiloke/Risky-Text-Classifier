ÊAfraid I'm developing an EDI'm afraid I'm on my way to develop an eating disorder.It started easy: when my thoughts were racing, eating cold stuff (usually ice cream) would calm them down. At first, it started with just one bowl of ice cream. But it became more and now, six months later, I usually eat the equivalent of four/five bowls. At first, I ate when my thoughts were racing and/or I was feeling particularly low. Now, I sometimes also eat when I'm bored. And it isn't just ice cream either. I notice myself often eating stuff when I don't even feel like eating, but just for the sake of it, or because I don't know what else to do. This includes eating stuff I'm intolerant to (gluten and casein/milk).Last autumn I'd quit eating because I was refusing to sustain my body as I didn't want to live; also, as I'm immortal, I don't really NEED food. Since my lowest point I've gained a substantial amount of weight; going (in BMI) from somewhat underweight to almost overweight. I know some of that is because of the meds I'm on, but I think it's also because I'm eating too much.For the last week or so, I've quit eating ice cream when I'm feeling bad as I don't think it's healthy. But I just don't know what to do anymore.Does anyone know what this sounds like, what to do, how to help?
