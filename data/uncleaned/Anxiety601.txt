Anxiety causing eating disorderNot sure where to put this so will just post it here. Anyone who saw my last post might have seen I did not eat much while I was on holiday. Which although I knew how bad it was for me I was unable to stop it. It made me realise that I think I may have developed an eating disorder as for the past 6 months or so my eating habits have caused quite a bit of stress. Until now I think I denied it was even a problem to myself but now I'm scared it's getting a bit more serious. There are so many foods that I will no longer eat because they come under a list of food that are too oily, salty, garlicky, greasy, rich etc. I won't eat after certain times of the day or certain food at a time of day.. I have to be in complete control of the food I eat so would rather go hungry rather than eat something someone else has prepared. Every night my goal is to go to bed feeling hungry and I now prefer feeling hungry to feeling full. It's getting progressively worse and worse and I have absolutely no control over it. It's like my brain freezes up and refuses to let me eat. I've lost weight so now I'm only 45kg which I looked up and is 25% less than the lower end of the healthy range for my height so I'm really scared cause I don't want to be like this any more and don't want to cause long lasting harm to my body. I feel at a loss at what to do as all my efforts to control my anxiety and panic attacks meant that all the food controlling was like a way of dealing with anxiety. I don't know what to do.
