Happy happy day¥	Hi everyone,¥	I finished my treatment, chemo, mastectomy  and radio therapy exactly two years ago, two years of ups and downs and finding strength,  I have slight lymphoedema, which is under control, and rib pains which have been investigated thoroughly,  My oncologist requested MRI three weeks ago and there was something in the pelvic are which he had to investigate. So I had ultra sound on that area two days ago. I have also had a full body bone scan.¥	My husband and I went to see the wonderful Dr Hughes Davies at Addenbrookes in Cambridge yesterday to get the results of the ultra sound he  and told us that there was nothing at all to worry about from the ultra sound, he asked me about my rib pains and thinks it is complex regional pain syndrome which will gradually, maybe slowly improve and for which there is a lot I can do to help myself.¥	AND then he said " I don't want to see you any more, you are discharged!!!!!!" Everything is fine. It was very emotional and happy.  He had told me on a previous appointment that he was glad he was in this line of medicine as there were so many good results.¥	I just wanted to pass this good news on to you who are maybe just starting or nearly finishing treatment .....  it does happen  ..... and often     ¥	  and its wonderful. Also, I wanted to thank all of you lovely ladies who answered my questions, gave me advice and most of all listened and answered.  I don't know how I would have managed without Macmillan Support, you are wonderful people, THANK YOU!!!!!¥	God bless, everyone, chin up and keep positive.¥	Maggie
