Sorry haven't been able to help in awhileSorry haven't been on here for a few weeks, I have been so busy to the point of passing out on the couch at 9 pm last night--can't say I don't hate it though because I don't have time to think. I have a to-do list today that feels like 5 miles long and while part of me wants to cry because I'm thinking "holy crap, how am I going to do all of this" I am SO grateful my brain is focused on other things.ÊAnd while I want to help, I also find staying off these boards helps my anxiety. When I read about unheard of diseases or weird symptoms, I start ruminating BUT nowhere near as bad as before.Biggest tip from me: exercise, don't read the news but be aware of the world, eat REAL food, walk outside, get on meds if necessary and find a good therapist (and don't be afraid to bounce around, it took me 3 try's to find one)Ê
