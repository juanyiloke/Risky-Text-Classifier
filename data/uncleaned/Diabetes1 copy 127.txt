HeartburnHi,has anyone been suffering from heartburn when their blood sugars go high?i started on a new insulin regime two weeks ago, I used to take Humalog and insulatard via syringe Am and pm,now I have gone on to the basal / bolus regime using the pens,I'm on Humalog and levemir,I have noticed in the time I have been on this that I get heart burn when and if I go high,I check on my monitor and it shows I'm right,I'm sure this isn't a coincidence and I don't know whether it's a good or bad thing, any info appreciated Thanks
