I'm a late bloomer to tech in general. I can't live without texting, and I get most of my support this way.I don't like to hold the phone to my ear because I'm worried about brain cancer.I can't easily read the news on the internet because it's about me or directed at me.I don't do Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, or others like that, but sometimes You Tube. and I still buy old fashioned CD's for music.I do love my camera phone!Over all I think it has been both helpful and hurtful (technology) in regards to my mental illness. What do you think?
