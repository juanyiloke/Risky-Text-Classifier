I want to run awayI know that this is really needy and people on here are probably really sick of me posting but I am really struggling today with strange thoughts and I don't know what the best thing to do is.ÊI'm so overwhelmed, I have literally just left day treatment a month ago and I have really lapsed (to my shame) and I saw my therapist yesterday and she told me I'll end up back in hospital quickly if I don't improve soon. I think that's stupid and will not happen but she even mentioned IP because although I am not in the anorexic range (yet) my weight loss has been so dramatic. I've been ill so long and I feel like a hopeless case and I want people to give up on me.ÊI want to pack a bag and run away from everything. My mum and all of her concern for me and trying to force me to eat, my friends because I feel guilty for letting them down, my treatment team because they had such faith in me and now I'm screwing up.ÊI am literally looking at train tickets and I have some money in the bank and I think if I just went somewhere else I could just self destruct by myself and not hurt anyone. Like I could probably live a few days in a park or something or book a cheap hotel until the money runs out.
