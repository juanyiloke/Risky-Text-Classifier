Retirement FlatsHi everyone,Im new to this forum.I am hoping to purchase a retirement flat next year. Does anyone know anything about retirement flats? I understand that these are usually leasehold, do they have a sinking fund incorporated into the service charge, or am I likely in the future to receive charges for major repairs running into several thousands of pounds?Hope to hear from anyone who maybe lives in these type of flats or has knowledge of them.
