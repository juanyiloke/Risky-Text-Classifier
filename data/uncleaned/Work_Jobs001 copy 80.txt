1 hours notice - contract not up________________________________________Hello folks.I've worked with a company for almost one year. Yesterday, at 10.00am, my boss said he would chat to me later about renewing my contract, at about 3 or 4pm. I thought it might be a good sign - he wanted to talk about it!At 4.30pm, my boss took me into his office, to discuss renewing my contract, told me that the company has decided not to renew my contract as my position has "run its course" and they no longer require my services. He said that I would finish up, at 5.30pm (yesterday), and "that would be it".My contract's not up until Monday week, and I think that just one hours notice, to pack my stuff & say my goodbyes is slightly unfair.Thoughts??(Mods - feel free to move this if its not in the right place!)
