they haven't a clue5 weeks ago i got transferred from the acute mental health ward i was on to a long term PD therapy unit but they have no clue in how to deal with eating disorders.I am slipping back into old habits big time and the staff here are so easy to fool with my eating. On the acute ward even though they didn't have the experience with ED they were supportive and kept me from getting to an unsafe weight but since i have been here my weight has dropped a lot. I know it is getting to a point where it is dangerous and even when i try to explain how they can support me they only do it for a day or two and then leave me to it. I am on a meal plan but that doesn't mean much to them they just write down what i am having and leave it at that. I am on fortijuice drinks but they let me take them to my room and a lot of the time don't check if i have drank it anyway.I'm going in a downward spiral and i can't seem to get back up on my own but i don't know how to ask for the support. I feel that if i ask for help then i have failed.ÊDoes anyone have any advice please?thanksemx
