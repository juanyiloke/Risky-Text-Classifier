Constantly surrounded by dietingWhy is it that everywhere u look is dieting skinny girls weight loss strategies it's doing my head in I was at low weight but have put on a lot of weight over the last year and I mean a lot to the point I am now obese I feel disgusting in my body and seeing the world around meI feel like such an odd and freakish individual to the point that it makes me want to hurt myself or worse still take my own life. The bigger I get the worse it is i feel trapped I just can't stop eating. I have had specialist treatment for an eating disorder for 4 years now but now my problem has switched to overeating instead of under eating no one seems to care? But to me it is the worst thing in the world and makes me so much more unsafe. I'm not sure what to do or even what the point of this post is but what I do know is I need help big time! Someone help me please.......
