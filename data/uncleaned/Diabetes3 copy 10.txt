weird spot =/Hiya.. i havent been really checking up on this forum for a while iv been revising for my exams which went okay today (phew) now time to prepare for the next three   anyways last night i had noticed a small blue'ish spot on the top of my feet at first i thought it was a bruise but since i didnt hurt myself or bruise easily for that matter thought it was strange. the spot doesnt hurt when i give it a good push so didnt take any notice but then this morning when i woke up the spot had got a slightly bigger just about under half an inche in diameter and yes i did use a ruler to measure it LOL . Also i have noticed my feet are always cold however iv always had cold feet. I dnt know if the two are related and i know diabetics should look after their feet.Also i went to the pharmacy to pick up prescription so showed my feet to the pharmacist and she said it does look strange. didnt tell her i was a diabetic and so she said to keep an eye on the spot for the next couple of days..should i be worried?
