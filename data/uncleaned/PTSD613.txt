facing my pastPosted 2 months agoHiThis isn't easy for me to do but basically I have had a very very bad childhood. To begin with my dad was a complusice liar and addicted to dope and gambling. Basically he would make up lies such as he was in a car accident so couldn't see me when he was actually at the dogs (I was 7).This has really affected me.I was bullied at primary.My mums got an illness (I can't remember what it's called) but it means my grandparents did a lot of my upbringing.My mum met someone when I was 7 we moved in with him and then eventually mum married him I was 10. Mum had two boys with him. They divorced when I was 15. Long story short he was controlling and abusive to mum and to me but mum didn't know this. I was anorexic when I was 12 up to 16. Mum didn't notice. Anyway she got help with it all and support but still suffered depression and I had to do a lot of the upbringing of my brothers.Anyways since all this I can't seem to keep a steady relationship. In my last relationship I was securely abused.This relationship I'm in now my partner lies a lot.I need advice on how to deal with everyday stress and how to face my past. Maybe letters or something?
