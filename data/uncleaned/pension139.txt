Married Couples AllowanceHi,I am very confused on married couples allowance and wonder if anybody can clarify this, bearing in mind my situation.Ê I am 63, retired and claiming only a small state pension.Ê My husband is unemployed, 60, not entitled to any kind of state benefits, but has started to take his occupational pension, since he cannot find work, despite trying and it is also necessary, since we cannot live on my small state pension.I am very confused, but if he finds work, even it if it tempory work, is it more advantageous that he gets married couples allowance, if he can get it, so that he will pay less taxes.Ê I think when I worked I use to claim this.Ê However, I have not worked for nearly 6 years.If anybody can clarify all this, I would be most grateful.Thanks.
