Insomnia caused by anxietyI'm tired. Can barely read the computer screen even with my glasses on. It's almost 4am and I'm still awake. What am I waiting for? The sunlight.At first I thought it was just insomnia. I've had it every now and again for years. Perhaps just I'm not tired enough yet. However, it has been months since the last time I've been able to sleep for more then 5 hours at night.ÊI caught myself looking at my window one day, the morning light was starting to shine through, and I had a disturbing thought.ÊSigh. I can finally sleep.It was like I had been holding my breath all night long. Pacing towards the window or door anytime I heard something outside. I live in apartments and noises can be constant. I had some sort of anxiety. Of what, even I don't know. It's like I'm expecting something bad to happen.But as soon as I see sunlight outside I immediately feel safer. I can finally sleep and not have nightmares. I still cannot stay asleep longer then 5 hours. Even in the day time.Does anyone else suffer from this sort of anxiety?Have you been able to successfully fix it?I would really like to sleep all night through for more then a day
