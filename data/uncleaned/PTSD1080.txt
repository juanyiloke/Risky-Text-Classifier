i mentioned why i prolly have PTSD in my first post http:// .com/health/help-with-p tsd-please-t264463.html And iv been reading alot of comments on how to get over it, but why is it that i dont feel comfortable in trying it? my family wont listen to me and my friends feel like theres nothing they can do but be there for me I feel all alone and dont really feel like giving a shot at trying to make it all finaly end sometimes i think to myself that maybe it will just go away by its self one day, but i know that wont happen i have alot of suicidal thoughts and a feeling of helplessness and lonleyness and part of me is crying for help, yet most of me just wants to take an overdose of drugs and kill myself i never got officially diagnosed with PTSD by a psychiatrist but im pretty sure i have it and im too scared to ask for help, not that anyone would listen to me before Some part of me is sick of feeling so tense and jumpy around people i care about and my flashbacks are driving me crazy all i want to do is take more DXM and just end it all i did try telling my brother about it again and he made fun of me for being a coward that just wants to kill herself and that didn't help at all believe me
