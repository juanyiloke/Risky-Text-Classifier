Wellbutrin XL and eating problems...I'm on Wellbutrin XL and if I don't take it, I get anxious because I actually feel hunger without it. I am afraid to stop taking it but it feeds into my restricting. Should people with eating problems take it? I mean I feel trapped. If I take it I can be okay with how much I eat a day plus my exercises (however I do get really dizzy comeMidday) anyway, when I don't take it id eat the same amount but feel I have to purge. Or I'd eat a little more and feel like purging. So when I don't take it I am unhealthy but when I take it I am unhealthy.Since taking it people I knew before I shut everyone out tells me how much I've lost when in all honesty I don't see at all. I really don't see the loss they are talking about. But it makes me all the more never want to stop taking this medicine.... I'm not sure what to do without it. I'm not sure what to do period.
