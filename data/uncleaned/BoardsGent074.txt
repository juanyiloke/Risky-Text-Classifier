Gynecomastia surgeryHi,I'm seriously considering getting this surgery done. I like to think i'm quite fit as i go to the gym regularly. I've trimmed down body fat everywhere expect for around the nipples. It's driving me mad. I wear compression tops anytime i'm out and about.Has anyone had experience of getting this done in Dublin? I'm aware it's quite expensive but i'm sick to death of being self-conscious about it to be honest.ÊI'm curious to know if clinics would refuse you if they feel there's not enough to operate on. I've seen some images on the net of people with gynecomastia and mine aren't that big compared. But it's enough to make me self-conscious and would like to get it surgically removed now.
