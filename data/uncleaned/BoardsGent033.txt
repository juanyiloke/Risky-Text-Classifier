What do you ask for in the barbers?I never really understood how to ask for a haircut in the barbers.I was with my friend one day when I was about 12 and heard him ask for a 5 on top and 2 on the sides. Since then, thats what I get. Maybe a variation like a one on the side or a scissors on the top. If I ever wanted something different I wouldn't have a clue what to ask for.For fellas into their style what do you go for? I assume most people would ask for two numbers like myself. Is this the case?
