Feeling really lost-positive updateHonestly, I feel so lost and tired of everything. Recovery, the illness and just life over all. I am so tired of fighting. I dont even wanna return to a normal life anymore. Its too much.ÊSo tired of therapy too. I feel so stupid and awkward both under and after therapy. This whole recovery is way too much. I have no privacy anymore.I feel like i am constantly being analyzed and judged.ÊLike next week, i have a meetings with a social worker monday, next day a nurse (for weigh-in which is never fun!) , then later my therapist. Next day two other people from my ed team. And then a doctor the day after that. Its getting way too much for me!ÊI dont have a normal life at all. I am either home, walking around like a zombie or attending ed meetings. And i am soo drained. How on earth am i ever gonna be able to lead a normal life...i feel so far away from everything
