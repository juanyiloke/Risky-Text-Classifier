Êwant my heart to stop but scared too
I know that I am getting there with the therapy and I know that I need to hold on to the hope of everlasting recovery but I don't know whether this episode will make me more susceptible in the future to more episodes. It's hard to imagine recovery. That scares me a lot. Who will I be? And I have feelings of wanting to drift out of this world. To put a stop to all of this. And the ECG result last week where my GP said that my heart isn't ok after my history of eating disorders partly scares me but also gives me hope that my heart could stop. Mixed thoughts. Head feels very muddled right now X
