Am I at risk for osteoporosis?by psycho113 » Wed May 27, 2015 11:18 amI've been taking antipsychotics for a few years now and have had enlarged breasts since I've began taking them but no significant sexual dysfunction. So I think while my prolactin is high, my testosterone is normal. I have read that some antipsychotics put you at risk for osteoporosis because they cause hyperprolactinemia but I haven't found out if the osteoporosis is caused directly by the prolactin elevation or by the resulting testosterone decrease. I'll ask my doctor about it but I want to know, if anyone has any information about this, if I'm at risk for osteoporosis. I also want it confirmed independently of my doctor.
