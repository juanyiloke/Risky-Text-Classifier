Waiting on bed for inpatient unitI'm waiting on a bed for an inpatient unit. I've been taken out of work by my doctor and he thought I would b in already it's been nearly a week. I just don't know what to do I can't stop using symptoms of all kinds and I feel myself just getting worse and worse. My boyfriend is so worried he just keeps telling me keep hanging on til they call but it's so hard. I want the help. This will b my 4th admission in 2 years. Where I live doesn't believe in the peg tube so I can't even get that I can't even get feeding tube til I go either cause don't believe in that either. I go 2 hours away each time for my admissions. I just need help. I have to call my doc for refills one health related meds that he didn't refill cause thought I would b in already and idk what he is going to do. I also messed up bad last night with one of my self destructive behaviors. I'm just a mess right now and idk what to do.
