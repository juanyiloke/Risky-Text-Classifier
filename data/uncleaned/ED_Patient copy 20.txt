I need some help.Ive never admitted to having a problem with food, i kept it as not a problem, but my weights plummeted, i find it difficult to do certain tasks. I count every single calorie, i stop my body from having the nutrients it wants. So i asked for help. But im scared, its been months of me trying to fight the voices in my head. WIll it ever go away? I am so frustrated with myself that ive let my mind take over my whole life, this stupid pathetic fantasy of being so thin, you can snap, i want that? apparently. I want it all to go away. But i just cant see that happening any day soon. Everyone just says the same thing, 'just eat, tis not difficult' i would give anything in the world for it to be that easy. I just need someone else who understands, help me
