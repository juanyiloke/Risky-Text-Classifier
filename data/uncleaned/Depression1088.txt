six months of non-stop emotional painI have been in severe emotional pain for over six months with no breaks.Because of this my marriage, family, friendships, career - everything is threatened.I am seeing a therapist, but it is like holding an umbrella up to a tidal wave.Before this started, I was happier than ever.I know the reason for my situation, but it is something I must accept - it cannot be changed.Looking for support here.Thanks,- Rez
