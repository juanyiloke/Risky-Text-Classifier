Applied for some jobs todayHaven't held a job with any consistency in nearly 6 years. Isolating a lot, still not able to see the entire point in working so hard and dealing with people (but starting to see some of it again), not happy but relatively stable. Bit the bullet and sent out my resume to a few places. I've gone through an entire process since sending them out "This is a mistake, life is comfortable as it is now (on disability), you're going to fail" etc., but think I'm going to stick with it and see what happens. No future living like this for me.Going to sign up for classes in the fall too. It's kind of weird. When the fog lifts for even a moment, so many things that seemed impossible... I realize, are sometimes just a few phone calls or meetings and a little luck away. That a lot of this depression is just part of a routine. I'm 30 now. Wasted the last 6 years in a lot of ways. Learned a lot too. Maybe 33-34 by the time I complete a degree. Might never make up the employment gap. Degree might be for nothing. But I'll be 34 in 3-4 years either way. Why not?Just thought I'd share. I don't have a ton of hope but am moderately excited at the prospect of forcing this cage open a little bit. Maybe a lot of us are just a few phone calls and a little luck away from a change of some kind.
