Low blood sugarsAre slightly low blood sugars actually bad for you or is it just because of the risk of going very low or getting too used to being low? Take this morning. I did a correction as soon as I woke up as bg was 9.1. I then a bit later decided on what I wanted for breakfast bolused for it and did some housework. A bit more time passed than I had thought and I was 4.3 before I sat down to breakfast, then dipping a bit low to 3.8 for a bit. Should I have stuck the the usual rule of 20g carb wait 15 minutes then another 20g carb? As I had just had breakfast I knew that would soon hit as I had yoghurt so I just kept checking it and it started going up from breakfast. I felt fine and had no hypo symptoms and just sat still and paused the housework till it was ok again. If I told my Dr I didn't follow the hypo rules he would have a fit. I do always follow them usually. But I'm seeing that they are overkill often. On the other hand if I feel fine at 3.8, and I have food that should hit bg soon, and it isn't dropping any lower and I'm not driving or moving or doing something that will drop bg further, is it a problem? Am I storing up problems by not going having 20g carb of juice like I'm supposed to?The other rule around hypos I've been given is never correct within 24 hrs of a bg under 4. So normally I now wouldn't correct at all for 24 hrs after that little 3.8 I had. Even if I'm 20+, no correction allowed for 24 hours. Because the liver needs to restock its supplies is the explanation I've always been given. But, I'm not sure on this now. Should there be some leeway or flexibility. Treating a 3.8 differently to a 2.8? Any ideas?
