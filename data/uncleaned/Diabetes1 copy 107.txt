high bgHiya, my bg readings are acting up. I am on 4x500mg metformin per day, last hba1c was 49, I do lchf and have lost about 2st and usually my bg is reasonable but sometimes I`ll have a couple of days where I`m high for no apparent reason. Last night at 7.15 I was 7.4, I ate home made tomato soup with a very small slice of wholemeal toast, did some exercise at 8.15 , at 9.15 I was 9.9 and at 10.15 I was 10.4. Does anybody have any idea why this could be? I should add that prior to this I had eaten less than 20g carbs all day.
