OK so I know that some people out there aren't too into the holistic/natural approach but I cannot deal with the side effects of normal asthma meds so I have been trying what's out there naturally to get some help. I havent had much luck aside from some relief fromacupuncture and then I came to try a mushroom suppliment called Cordyceps PS made by Health Concerns Co. Now I am not a rep for them or anything, try whatever brand you like, I just happen to have chosen that one. In just one dose of cordyceps, I noticed an effect. I could take a little bit deeper breath. In just three days, for a little while I actually was able to forget I have such difficult asthma/acid reflux issues. I am taking 500 mg once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. This is day 5 and I continue to see improvement! That's not even taking as much as the recommended dose! I want to let people know that this is possibly a great way to get even a little help without medications. I have read many people's reviews on different sites saying that they got a lot of relief from this too. SO PLEASE, atleast give it a try. I spend so much time miserable from breathing horribly. I'd love to help someone.
