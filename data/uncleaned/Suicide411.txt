unwanted and unappreciated all my life…NainaI’m from india…grown up in a middle class family… average looking among my sis and bro… always been abused over this topic and suddenly met a guy who made me feel like a fairy…I’ve been emotionally and physically fooled by him..today morning I told him to kill myself and he laughed at me saying u can’t.. I had a hoe that someday something good will happen to me but that hoe is fading away slowly… is there anyway to survive?everyone in this world are cheaters and users only who play u and throw away?
