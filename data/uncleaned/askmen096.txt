fragile/woe-is-me people2012-10-10, 02:48 PMHave you ever encountered people (mostly females) who have this "fragile/woe-is-me" act? I seldom see it in the hospital but in grad school, I sit next to one. She's younger than me and generally, I'm fine with being the big sister. Having 2 sisters, I'm used to it anyway. We're supposed to be doing a group project and I was elected leader which is again fine with me. I'm always the leader in school projects anyway and I like being the leader (particularly if I like the project) but when I delegated people to do their assigned readings/etc, she didn't say anything. A few hours later, she comes up to me and begs to switch parts so I agreed to switch with her. After 2 weeks, I called her up to check on her and she gives me this line that she doesn't know anything about journal articles or how to use PubMed search engine and I got really frustrated! She wasted 2 weeks when she could have called me and asked for help!ÊSo anyway, I helped her out and then I reminded her to do her parts of the project. She says yes and doesn't do anything. 2 days later, I had to text her again and remind her to get it done. She gets it done alright but according to her, her part is "so difficult" that she's just doing the other part. I'm like WTH?!?! We all have our parts in the project so do yours! So I told her that I did read what she made and I appreciated all the effort but I already assigned 2 people for that part and she needs to work on her part. When I was giving out assignments, I asked everyone if they had any issues/concerns about their assignment and this girl complained that hers was again, "difficult" so I said ok, I'll swap with you but now, she says it's difficult again?!?!?!I get it that she's all fragile (and I can't believe she has an even more active dating life than me until she got married earlier this year) but really, enough!I'm just ranting.Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it's inspiring.
