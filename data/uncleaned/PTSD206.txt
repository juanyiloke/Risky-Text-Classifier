Sexual molestation in childhood, has my PTSD made me racist?by strawberrygirl » Sun Apr 05, 2015 8:01 pmI was sexually molested as a child by an older cousin of mine. At the time I didn't know what was happening but it affected me all my life - for nearly 15 years now, and it doesn't stop.I don't get flashbacks or nightmares, but I have found that I am repulsed by men of my race. I feel this may have a connection to my cousin who molested me. I don't think I'm a racist to my own race, but I just can't be physical with men of my own race. I don't feel any attraction or any emotional connection to them. I can't even explain it properly. But I've tried explaining it to my mother and sister who have given me a cold shoulder and called me 'racist' because of this. Ironically though, they don't like the idea of inter-racial marriages, so I guess that makes them racist. Yet, they fail to see this. They fail to see that I have a Reason to feel the way I do, yet they have no reason to be repulsed by other races.So they told me "If you don't marry someone of your own race, regardless of your trauma and the fact that you find them repulsive due to your trauma, then you're not one of us. If you marry someone outside your race, you're not one of us."They also said "You have to face your fear and repulsion by marrying your own race and 'maybe' you'll overcome your repulsion."It's like I'm talking to a brick wall when I speak to them. They have NO idea how traumatised I feel and how I'd rather kill myself than marry someone of my own race because that's how disgusted I feel. I feel reminded of my molestor everytime I see men of my own race. I can't bear the thought of sharing the same bed with a man of my own race.I don't know what to do and I feel guilty but I don't know why. I FEEL LIKE I'M A BIG MISTAKE TO EVERYBODY AND A FAILURE TO MY FAMILY"Nobody understands me or cares and I feel like I should never have been born!
