Should I be worrying this much?Hi,First time post here and I appreciate any feedback I can get.So I am 25 years old male turning 26 in a month and recently had to move home with my father after my relationship of 6 years ended. I moved out of my house with my girlfriend 2 years ago and lived in an apartment with her. For the most part i was very independent and paid for everything myself and it felt good. The only thing my father pays for me is my car insurance because it is 400 dollars a month due to an accident that happened a couple years back. Now that I am home and he doesn't charge me rent (he is a great guy) I feel like I am lost and don't know what I am doing. It bugs me that I have to live with him and not necessarily depend on him but like I am almost 26 and just don't know what I am doing. I have a decent job that I just started but not making the greatest money yet...they pay for my new 2015 car which is awesome but sometimes I feel bad that I have to lean on my dad for extra support whether it be the car insurance or a bit of money when I am running low. I try stay positive and tell myself that it's going to get better and I try and focus on the positive but sometimes I just get so down and it hurts. I feel that it is a good thing that inside I want to detach myself from him completely (financially) but it just seems not possible right now with what I make and the current situation I am in.Am I over thinking things?Should I be 100% on my own?Should I just take a chance and move out?What do you think?Thanks again for reading and helping out.
