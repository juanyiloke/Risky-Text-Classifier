Making ProgressSo yesterday I attended my first therapy session and received my bartender's certificate.  It was a pretty busy day to say the least.  I liked the therapist; from what I told him about my life and experiences, he pretty much said that what I felt were signs of clinical depression, and then he said the way he would treat this is through anti-depressants with therapy.  Now, not to discount the power of anti-depressants or anyone using them with great results, but I just don't trust something that will permanently change my brain chemistry.  I've dealt with anxiety for a good chunk of my life, and I've done it without much help; I was obsessed with fixing my anxiety and as a result, obsessed with cognitive behavioral therapy in high school.  With the help of the internet and some strategies I devised, I had some real results and was overall a happier, less stressed guy.  That probably wasn't the most efficient method, but my point is that if I can have concrete results by using therapy techniques from the internet, then maybe I won't need the drugs.  Going back next Friday. In other news, I'm trying to get in job search overdrive mode, but netflix keeps pulling me away :p.  Gotta stop procrastinating.  Eh... And that's where I am right now. Thanks for listening ladies and gents :)
