What does a low blood sugar feel like?I'm starting a diabetes blog for a close friend who was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. She's taking it pretty hard and says she's "not ready to be a diabetic yet." I don't want to push her to talk or make her feel uncomfortable, but I know sooner or later she's going to have the same questions I had when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a child. When you get diagnosed as a child, it's the only life you know and you don't question it quite like you would if you were diagnosed as a grown woman with a husband and family! I took it in stride -- but she questions everything! I figure when she is ready to talk, she'll have lots of questions and this forum is a good start, plus the blog I'm starting for her.Now, about that low blood sugar. I know everyone is different, but for the most part, the symptoms are the same. For me, having a low blood sugar makes me have to pee really bad! Kind of like the feeling you get when your blood sugar is high, the same urgency! What does having a low blood sugar feel like to you? Thanks so much!
