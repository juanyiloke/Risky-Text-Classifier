DS is 13 months old and on Friday morning, out of nowhere he got quite poorly. He became lethargic, irritable, disinterested in his food, sleeping frequently and had a temperature of 38.8 which needed both paracetamol and ibuprofen in order to come down.He had a temperature through Friday night and Saturday daytime but seemed ok in himself.This morning, after my husband had dresses him I saw two red spots on DS's face so I stripped him for a full body check and he had more red spots inside his wrists, between his fingers, across his thighs and calves, some over his shoulder and more along the soles of his feet.ÊI rang 111 who were concerned it may be hand, foot and mouth disease so asked me to have DS reviewed by a Pharmacist who are trained to deal with rashes and identify illnesses.I wasn't too impressed with the Pharmacist really, he didn't say much except that it may be heat rash (?) and to just keep an eye on it and see a GP if it worsened.Throughout the day more and more spots have appeared in various regions of his body, they seem to be spreading in front of my eyes. He continues to be well in himself, he's still a little off his food but is his normal happy and playful self. He hasn't had a temperature since 6pm last night.Does this sound like chicken pox?I'm planning on visiting the GP tomorrow like I was advised to but am wary about taking DS out in case he is infectious. If it is chicken pox though surely I must have it confirmed by a GP rather than me just assume it is as for future medical assessments and for his medical history I'd need to know for definite?
