Hello,First time doing anything like this and completely in the blue with anything to do with babies. My brother has had a baby, a beautiful little girl. I'm not a natural maternal woman, although I love children.Being in the city and not having any friends that have children, I feel like a spare part, unsure of the right thing to say, do, buy or act. i really want to be helpful without over-stepping the mark, but at the same time have no idea.ÊWhat should I do to help my brother and my sister-in-law? What would be truly useful, what things should I buy that both mother and baby will really appreciate. And more importantly, what do you lovely mums think are good qualities in an aunty?
