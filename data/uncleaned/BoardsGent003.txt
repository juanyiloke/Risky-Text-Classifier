Ever feel that your libido is a curse?Hi there folks. Lately I have really been feeling that I'm just a slave to my libido.ÊAt 38 years of age it shows no signs of retreating. In my teens and early twenties I had plenty of one night stands, since then I have been in a couple of what would be considered healthy sexual relationships and still have not been satisfied .I constantly have it on the mind to the point that it feels like a curse, like something that plagues me every waking hour. If my girlfriend is away for a night I'm practically going out of my mind.ÊMasturbation and porn helps for all of about 30 mins and then im back to square one. I don't want to be over elaborate or sordid here so all i can say is that the urge is almost constant and I cant imagine going through another few decades being a slave to this.ÊThis not a piss take. Can someone please tell me, is this just what its like for every bloke or have i got a problem? In fact, ladies feel free to comment too.
