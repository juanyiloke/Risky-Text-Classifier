ÊAtos medicalI have been receiving dla for 3 years now . I have gad and severe depression , and was due to have an atos interview / medical last week . It's impossible for me to go to places like that so I got a letter from my doctor , sent it to atos and they said they would give me a home visit and to call back in a week , I don't use the telephone so my wife called this morning and atos have made a decision based on my forms and just sent it back to dwp without even seeing me . Now I'm terrified . Has this happened to anyone else ?
