 Nebulizer, Yes or No________________________________________Hi my son is 13. He has had asthma all his life. It has recently gotten worse. His peak flow is 290 and he takes advair, singular and weekly shots with steroids and albuterol PRN. He has a flare up every day and needs to go to the hospital every week. His O2 is usually at 90%. Our doctor recommended a nebulizer and oxygen. I never heard of a thirteen year old on oxygen 24/7. Is it necessary and should I have a nebulizer with mask or mouthpiece? Is it loud? Help!
