ÊReading others and yourselfGuys and mainly, gals!ÊI'm very exciting with my next therapy. The appointment is next May, 5th. So I want you to tell me things about your therapy.ÊOne of the problems I have is to read people properly. I tend to think everybody have good intentions and it's easy for me to appreciate their good points. But, when there are feelings I try to read and control any sign that could gives me a clue about if it's authentic or I have to worry and be on guard.ÊI'm afraid I can be very unfair in these situations. I don't like to think bad about people. It's unfair.ÊBut, it is neither healthy to overvalue them.ÊI know that the monitoring and the controlling thing is a defense mechanism.ÊDid your therapy help you to read better other people and yourself? I have to confess that I'm often lost in what people concerns but I'm also lost about myself.ÊDid your therapy help you to understand yourself better, and others...
