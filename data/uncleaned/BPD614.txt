I Have Borderline Personality DisorderSome Ppl Shouldn't Be Here OK....I am starting to realize that some people on this page shouldn't be here. This is not a joke. It is where some of us who really need to get advice and release pain,to turn to for strength and support. This group is callled "I HAVE BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER." . If you don't have BPD or living with a BPD victim, or trying to learn about it, then please show a little respect to those of us with an illness that makes us fragile at best.ok - i have decided to edit what I originally wrote here. I just want to tone it down a bit because all i really wanted to say was that some of us need to be able to talk with other victims without mindless idiots making us turn away from this valuable resource. We are in enough pain as it is and need a safe place to talk and know we are not alone
