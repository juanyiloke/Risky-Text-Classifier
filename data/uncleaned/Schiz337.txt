Someone who I thought was a friend that I skyped with on a fairly regular basis took me off their contact list for no apparent reason. I wish they would have at least told me why so I don't indefinitely alienate everyone I'm around for all eternity.ÊI feel the same way about interviews. I wish they would at least tell me why they have no interest in hiring me. I've applied to numerous jobs that I'm over qualified for but it seems as if I'm never given a job offer after the interviews.Can any of you relate?
