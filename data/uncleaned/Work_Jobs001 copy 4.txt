fixed term contract terminated before its up________________________________________Just looking for a few thoughts on this. I was taken on on a fixed term contract for a specific role. I've been told (after being in the business a little less then a year) that the business needs have changed and they need someone with more experience in my role. There is still a significant amount of time left in my contract.I'm being let go on this basis, but the role itself has not changed, and whether I was suitable or not in the first place, I was taken on for that role and kept on for a length of time. I've recently received a performance related bonus, and as recently as 4 days ago had a conversation with my boss about the projects I would take on in the coming year. I have never been put on a PIP or anything of the sort.Can they actually do this? should I try to reason with them or just go quietly and hope for the best in the future?
