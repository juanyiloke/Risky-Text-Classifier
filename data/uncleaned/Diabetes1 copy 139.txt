Thirty day meal planHas anyone else downloaded this?It's a lovely idea, the meals look good, and generally low carb. A huge amount of imagination and work has gone into this, save for one respect - the quanitities.As an example: peperonata for lunch on day one, to serve two has:16 peppers, 8 onions, 2 courgettes, 4 cloves of garlic and 1600g (4 tins) of tinned tomatoes.Gulp! I couldn't have eaten (half) that much even in my ravenous student days.What a shame.Many of the other lovely recipes have similarly elephantine quantities.Maybe the author felt that diabetics need to practice their maths skills by scaling quantities down.Best wishesAdamI hate the expression "nothing is banned completely"It leads people to think I can eat more than I am willing to do at the moment.On Saturday a well meaning chap tried to persuade me gluten free cake was OK and that diabetics were allowed cake.Yesterday people trying to get me to eat sandwiches between meals.I am trying to mentally arrange foods into "good most of the time (in moderation)", "foods where considerable care is needed" and "foods that are pretty much toxic (to me if not others)".Unless I cease to produce insulin and start having hypos, I can see no circumstances when Mars bars, rich cakes and sugary drinks are going anything other than harmful to my long term future.One problem is that my T2 95 year old father in law is generally good, but a little relaxed at times. My wife refers me to him when she feels I need to relax. I'm in my mid 50's and hope that I may have to manage this condition for 20 or 30 years. I suspect that he may eat the slightly dodgy stuff when we visit for social reasons.best wishesAdam(needed to rant)
