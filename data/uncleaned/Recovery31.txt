Starting To RecoverSince I have been seeing my therapist we have came to know each other as appointments have continued. I finally opened up to her about everything that had been going through, in honesty. Today, I have been excising in breaking the routine cycle of my ocd. I have slowly reduced relying on over the counter sleep aids, stopping myself when I repetitively say sorry, burning lavender for sleep and replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts. It can be hard when the the force/kick back from my ocd strikes when trying to ignore the certain things, but reminding myself that the obsessive targeting of negative thoughts is part of the ocd, I found this has greatly helped me. I have decided to stray from using antidepressants and focus on healing, covering this as best as I can, naturally. I had a hard past using antidepressants as a child, so the fear I have with medications is too strong to endure using trials. I have been taking Ashwagandha and Inositol, so far I haven't been taking the Inositol so much the Ashwagandha on a daily basis and I have noticed a difference in my mood improvement/anxiety since. I am keeping a promise to take things one day at a time and I am finally getting to know myself as a person.
