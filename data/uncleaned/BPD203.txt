ÊHello. First time posting.I was diagnosed with B.P.D. about 20 years ago. I spent a few months in an outpatient program at the hospital and proceeded to continue living. Over the years I've had about 15 jobs and frequently find myself in awkward situations because of my impulsive behaviour.ÊI hide it better today. I smoke a ton of weed everyday and can keep the rages under control. I can't stop thinking lately that every aspect of my life has been touched by B.P.D. Leaves me feeling sad and depressed. I haven't had contact with my family or my son for about 15 years now.ÊDoesn't seem to be much hope left anymore. I pretty much just function everyday in a stoned haze and try to keep appearances up.ÊThat's it .
