When is it ok to scream at your boss?2012-08-17, 05:20 PMhe's actually the assistant boss and has little to no management skills so when he told our Department director he had a problem with how I handled a situation at work, I basically told him off and instead of whining to upper management, he should grow a pair and tell me directly he had a problem with me! I told him it really pissed me off & he was a WIMP!anyway, Now I'm a bit concerned that Ive f*cked up our relationship. Should I avoid him completely or suck it up and tell him I'm sorry I lost my cool?Being strong is a beautiful thing to be!
