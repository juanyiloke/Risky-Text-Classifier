Are these psychotic symptoms?by TripleChocolate » Fri Jan 16, 2015 2:51 pmHello,i need your advice. In December my family doctor put me on an antidepressant due to my IBS. Unfortunately i had to stop the medication after three weeks, because it worsened the situation a lot. Just two days after the last dosage, i became extremely anxious, slept only for 4-5 hours and woke up very early with panic, diarrhea and a pounding heart. Then the intrusive thoughts came (and they are still here). Thoughts like- "what if i lose control and hurt my wife or my family?" - "what if i lose control and kill myself?"- "what if i'm going mad?"- "Am i a bad person?"Since then i cry a lot, which is also very uncommon for me - and of course, i'm feeling ashamed of myself. After yet another panic attack last friday i went to a psychiatrist (i've never met before) and talked to him for 5 minutes. His diagnosis: Suspected schizoaffective psychosis. I told him, that i am sometimes mildly depressed, while being socially inhibited, because the IBS makes it nearly impossible for me to spend time with my friends, go to university or enjoy life as i did before.The suspected diagnosis made things even worse as you can imagine, 'cause i'm afraid of being schizophrenic or schizoaffective. Sadly, my aunt suffers from schizophrenia, so there is atleast a small chance (~3%) that i have the disposition for it. By the way, i have no hallucinations, no visions, i hear no voices and i don't think that anyone or anything is after me. What do you think? Are these symptoms above psychotic? Pre-psychotic? Do i match the criteria for schizophrenia-prodrome?Best wishes,Chris
