The food programme Radio 4.... OH dear...The subject Diabetes.Dismissive of LCHF. & a "typist" T1.. Anyone tune into it???Edit.An angry @pshuttle of Lancashire adds below.... Just listened to the advice and opinions of the dietician on the Radio 4 Food Programme regarding daibetes and diet, and she is still pedalling the carbohydrates are fine for diabetics rubbish and as usual, the increasing evidence which is currently emerging, was discounted and rubbished. They keep talking about the fact that high fat is bad for your heart and kidneys etc, but totally ignoring/not mentioning the fact that constantly high blood sugar from consuming high amounts of carbs (which the balanced diet the NHS talks about, contains), causes challenges in the form of severe complications, such as Retinopathy, Neuropathy, amputations, liver and kidney problems (the list goes on).Quite angry really.The chap with Type 1 was much more reasonable though.Pete
