Insole that increases circulation on Prescription in UK!In the leaflet on this site entitled 'Diabetes, foot care and Foot ulcers' it has a section that discusses how to help prevent Foot ulcers occuring. I don't know about anyone else but there has been little out there other than diet changes, weight loss and keeping foot damage to a minimum and so on that has assisted this. There is as I mentioned a piece that discusses annual foot checks with a Podiatrist and changes to look out for. This---- ''Part of this review is to examine the feet to look for problems such as reduced sensation or poor CIRCULATION. If any problems are detected then more frequent feet examinations will usually be recommended.'' What I have discussed with my Doctor is an Insole that featured in the Express Newspaper after Christmas, claiming (it has been clinically proven) to increase circulation. They are called Liqua-Care Flowgel Orthotics and are now available on Prescription! You just need to chat to your Dr. (or podiatrist probably), to see if you are suitable. Any of us that suffer Neuropathy pain and numbness are prime candidates! I have cold feet and bought some. They are brilliant, just need to save up to get a pair for each pair of shoes! ;o) x
