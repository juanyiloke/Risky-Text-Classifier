I have suffered from PTSD since I was a toddler (34 years) due to childhood sexual, physical, emotional and verbal abuse from my father. The abuse ended when I was a teenager but I blocked out almost all of it to the point that I have no memories of my childhood. My memory is slowly closing in and I can't remember hardly anything clearly, even things that happened today. Nothing is sharp in my mind. About 7 months ago I woke up with symptoms of a stroke (confusion, cognitive impairment, pincer grasp weakness, imbalance, loss of memory) but my regular MRI of the brain was negative. I went in today to have another MRI done, this time with and without contrast. Since then I have gotten worse and developed other symptoms such as nystagmus (eyes shaking involuntarily) and times when I cannot move my arms and calves. I sleep a lot, even when I have things I want to get done. I must also mote that I have two autoimmune diseases as well that have just been discovered, systemic lupus and Sjogren's Syndrome. These are verified through blood work and other testing, but the neurological symptoms seem to have no other explanation other than conversion disorder. For those of you that don't know, conversion disorder is when PTSD manifests itself physically so you are sick but with no physical reason. I have a little trouble believing that my symptoms that don't seem to have an explanation could be from my own mind. I am starting therapy in 2 weeks after many years of avoiding talking about the issues. I am afraid to begin but know I have to. Anyone else develop conversion disorder after long term PTSD?
