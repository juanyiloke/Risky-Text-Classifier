How can you deal with something you can't remember but you and everyone else knows you went through it? I was horribly abused for the first 15 years of my life by my father, then for the next 6 years by a boyfriend. I completely blocked out everything about my dad (I have just about no memories at all of my childhood, good or bad) so I can't begin to deal with the memories because they haven't resurfaced. I have an appointment to begin therapy in 2 weeks but have had my preliminary diagnosis of PTSD, major depressive disorder, and conversion disorder. How can I begin to unblock these memories and should I even try to remember without a psychiatrist to help?
