ok...so my career track have gone really bad..2013-12-04, 11:40 AMI been in the Architecture/engineering industry for about 10 years. In the past 5yrs of my employment, it has gone to the downward spiral due to the job market slum and in addition to my lack of interest in the field. During this time frame, I been constantly laid off but never fired after just 3-6 months of employment from different companies.ÊThe obvious part was informed of not being the right fit for the office. I do get a bit agitated being inside an office and sit in front of computer all day and I do realize that I no longer have the desire to move forward and advance in this field. At the same time, I have necessary expenses to tackle that only these jobs will pay enough to cover them. I even applied to several jobs in different fields such as sales, admin support, IT, etc but it's 2x's more difficult to obtain them because lack of experience on my resume.I tried to make a career change to healthcare field but that only means I can't have a fulltme job since the courses are only offered fulltime day. At this point, I have no direction and can't figure out what fields to look into and I only know that when I get a new office job again it will just have the same outcome.Behind every success there are screw ups.
