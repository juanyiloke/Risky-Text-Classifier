I know it's silly. But since I can't manage to do some more meaningful things like reading, learning or watching tv, I'm putting my time in buying lotto.I have spend a lot of time pondering if it is something I want to do. I decided that it is only about a small affordable amount of money and that it is an easy game I still find it manageable. So I'll let myself buy a ticket to fill my time.I have lost all of my life savings after the onset. I spend it all for the voices asked me to. If I can have a fortune, I wish I could have a replacement. So I'm experimenting with chance. I intend to buy lotto as long as I want to. I haven't find other activities I can manage so well and have no problems in motivating myself to all the hassles. But i do feel empitness everytime when I find out someone win the jackpot but not me. So im looking at what it would take me to. What would u consider someone who buy lotto for life and never wins? Losing all the time certainly doesn't feel good. But mostly likely I would end up like that.I have a lot of time but I can't do things I used to enjoy doing. I can't walk as I have severe foot pain. I can't read as my head is not right. I feel stressed when I watch tv as I often don't understand what is going on. I feel strained. I only feel comfortable lying on my bed. But it often gives me a headache. I don't converse easily. Often feel like I have nothing to say. I feel i am dead. I don't want to spend like thirty years living like this. it's difficult for me to do little things. I can't find value to my suffering. I don't get it why endure? I'm confused. I wish there is some help for those who want to end their lives.
