Take a pay cut for less stress?2013-06-08, 07:28 PMWould you take a pay cut for a job with less stress?ÊJob one is dealing with people in high emotional situations where you are constantly yelled at everyday. You're pulled from multiple different directions from multiple people and when you make a decision, one of the parties are not happy about it. The workload is heavy so working only 9 - 5, 5 days a week is out of the question.ÊJob two still deals with people, but it's not in the high emotion situation - more just answering questions. Workload is less, the hours are longer (extra 30 min a day).Job one pays 58 - 60K. Job two pays 45 - 48K.ÊJob two also likely has more options of moving up.
