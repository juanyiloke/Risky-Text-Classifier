It is impossible for a coward to be depressed or suicidalThe biggest myth in the mental health world is that depression and suicide is an act of cowardice.Anyone who says this clearly hasn't given any thought to what they are saying. A coward is a person who is unable to take responsibility for their actions (or blame themselves). They would sooner allow a whole group of people to get hurt before they do.Suicidal people are the complete opposite of this. They don't care about themselves, but still care about other people in their life (even if they don't think they do). They believe society would be better off without them, so they face death, which is the hardest thing a person could ever prepare themselves for (think its easy to choose death? Then you have a lot to learn).A coward could never go down this route. Why? Because it's painful!They are not cowards: they think what they're doing is right -> the problem is, their head is in the wrong place, so they believe in the wrong goal.It's as simple as that.
