Extenuating circumstancesby AbramovicHello! My mother has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and I was wondering whether this will have effect on my requirements for the conditional offers that I have received. I contacted the universities about this, and they told me that they couldn't lower any offer but perhaps I would be admitted even if I would miss my requirements later this year. Has anyone had any similar experience or could someone tell me what my chances are if I don't meet my requirements? I'm trying my best, of course!  Thank you!
