Enzalutamide not working...what's next? Diagnosed a year and a half ago with Gleason 10, I've become resistant to hormone therapy after 8 months, had 10 cycles of docetaxel which I assume have done nothing as psa continued going up and I was put straight onto Enzalutamide. Oncologist says that, after 2 or 3 months of this, it doesn't seem to be working. Is there anyone in this position, very worrying, as options are running out? I am having radiotherapy over 5 days this week to the tumour in the hip area which is giving me pain.
