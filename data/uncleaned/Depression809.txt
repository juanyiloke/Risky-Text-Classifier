ÊSinkingI feel like I'm sinking again, after a year of doing better on some new meds. I'm 63 years old and sooo want to quit my job but I can't afford to retire. I "work" from home although I haven't been doing very much for what seems like a long time. I am isolated, marginalized, disconnected, demoralized and completely unmotivated. In short, depressed. I feel totally lost. I am worried that I will get fired for being so unproductive, and the thought of looking for another job at my age is daunting, to say the least. I have two teenage children to support through college. I guess you could say that I am having a later-life crisis.Anyway, it all feels so overwhelming. I just want everything to stop so I can get my head together. Thanks for reading.introvert in an extravert worldIn my job I have long been allowed to isolate (I work from home) but now am expected to travel to other states and establish relationships with policymakers like state legislators and agency heads. I am so totally unsuited for this kind of work. I am just not a talker. I have always been shy and it is a source of intense shame and anguish for me. I feel like everyone can see I have next to no people skills. When I am around people for long periods I start to shut down. Although I am silent on the outside, inside a voice is screaming that I'm worthless and defective. Which only makes the problem worse. And I am worried that I will fall into a depression.ÊI can't change my personality, but if I could just relax and be easier on myself, it would help a lot. It is very hard to relate to people when I am filled with inner turmoil.ÊCan anyone relate?
