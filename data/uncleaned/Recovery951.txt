Love life, and life will love you.Hi! I used to suffer from depression. I remember coming back home from school and just shutting the door behind me, burying my face in the pillow and blanket, and just crying to myself. Year after year, I'd get more and more afraid of being alone, or remind myself of the past. Ironically, I couldn't even realise that by allowing these thoughts to build up within me, I was perpetuating my own pain. Not so good. This year, nearing the end of 2013, I promised myself I'd at least try to dig myself up from my hole. I get it, it isn't always easy to break the shackles, I would say that it was actually way more comfortable stuck in the pit. But you can't give up. Even if no one believes in you, at least know that I do. You are not alone, and you will never need to be. When I promised myself to get back up, I told myself " whatever happens, happens." The problem we have nowadays is that we get so stuck on one thing, that we allow ourselves to drown in its own pool of pain. Reach out. Maybe not to someone else, or maybe do reach out to someone else. But just try. When I was 15, I looked out of my window one day, and for the first time, I could see everything; the Sunlight, the trees the colours. We can choose to look down or look up. So I beg you, look up. Look up, and you'll realise- Love and happiness has always been within you. all we need to do, is appreciate it. Don't give up.
