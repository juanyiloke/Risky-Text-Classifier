Moving to Greater Detroit area, Looking to network for a new position.2014-06-19, 01:50 PMGentlemen,I am a recent college graduate moving to the Greater Detroit area, with an extensive work history in Project Management, Office Management, and sales, as well as a college athlete and all before the age of 25. While I have a Psychology Degree with the intentions of a Masters, I won't be shooting for that until my fiancé completes her's in Economics first (#breadwinner). Regardless of my degree, I feel that there are two things that still truly matter, and thats experience and most importantly, who you know. Therefore, I am asking for help on any opportunities you may know about, or you yourself have something to offer. I'd be pleased to of course return any favor I possibly can, and look forward to seeing any tips or ideas you may have.Thanks for your help.Jason
