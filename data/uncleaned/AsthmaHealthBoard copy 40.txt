New adult onset asthma and don't want to use meds________________________________________O.k. so 6 months ago I got a respritory infection that ended up having me coughing for 7 weeks. Doctor put me on the usual antibiotic, prednisone, and cough syrup. It went away for 3 weeks and then every night I started wheezing and coughing. Went back to dr. and was told I have asthma. So they gave me a steroid inhaler to use 2 x a day and a rescue inhaler to use as needed. The steroids I was told to rinse my mouth after using because I could get thrush (yeast) in my mouth. Did the entire plan and it didn't control it any different than just using the rescue inhaler as needed. The steroids actually changed my voice and made my throat scratchy and sore. So what is the point if it's not working anyway? Also, if you can get yeast in your mouth why wouldn't it cause yeast in your lungs? I feel like doctors are all about prescribing meds. I also feel like meds just mask the symptoms and don't actually heal you. Can you heal your lungs? Can you make asthma go away without the use of all the chemicals that just cause other problems? Do the lungs start becoming addicted to the use of inhalers? I just feel like I should be able to get my lungs back to the way they worked before I got sick 6 mths ago without using drugs to do it. Anyone have any insight on trying to cure asthma without drugs?
