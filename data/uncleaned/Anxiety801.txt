Letting go of anxietyBit of a brain dump. I am really working hard to let go of my anxiety. It's plagued me for most of my life. I've struggled with what I realise was/ is codependency. I am on my own now. Been through depression, panic attacks etc. but it seems to be so hard to let go of anxiety and the depression that goes with it. Is it because I am so scared that the anxiety will leave a hole that will be replaced by something worse or is it that I just don't believe I can be anxiety free and therefore won't or can't let it happen? The thought of continuing this way for the rest of my life is so horrible. At the moment I am not feeling great physically which lets the whole anxiety demon really grow. How will I manage when I am even older and not able to do stuff physically. I know I don't always feel as bad as I do now but the fear is always there. I work, have friends and look like a functioning person but every morning and at the moment all day I am battling and battling to get through.Mornings any good methods to deal with?Hi (like a lot of people I think) I find the very worst part of the day is almost always when I wake and have to overcome that mountain of getting up,and facing the day. I know that I won't feel better until I do get up but it feels impossible. I was just wondering what sort of strategies other people use that help them? It doesn't matter how bad or good my general anxiety levels are the morning wake up is always bad. In very bad periods the fear of it means I do not want to go to bed even though I am desperately tired.Â ThanksCaro
