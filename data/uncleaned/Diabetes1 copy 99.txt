New Blood Monitor MetersI returned home the other evening to find TWO new blood meters on my doorstep - both sent by my GP. On calling my GP I was told that the NHS are needing to save money and so everyone has to use the new meters (GlucoRX Nexus). - the reason being the blood strips and lancets are cheaper, AND that everyone's prescription has been changed with immediate effect.I pointed out that they had sent me TWO - and so a bad example of how to save much needed money ! I said I would return one (and was advised I could keep it !). This really is a good way of saving money don't you think !On explaining that my current meter (which is less than 1 year old) is a OneTouch Verio and it gives far more information than this new one. This was a good way to keep better control and surely this was a good thing. I was told I had to have the new meter - and to get on with it.My real worry (if all that isn't bad enough) is the fact that I checked my glucose levels using both meters and there was a difference of 2.0. I was amazed.one said 8.1 and the other 6.1. The new meter being the lower reading. My question to whoever is listening, is how are we supposed to know which meter is giving the correct reading ! Have I been using a defective meter for the past year, or is the new one defective ? What a worry. I've read a few articles and each say that both meters are great. Obviously there is a difference, and this shouldn't be ........ surely.
