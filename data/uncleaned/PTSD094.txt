Anyone Else Feeling Unsupported?I know everyone's situation is different, but I am feeling/sensing a general lack of support on the forum these days. Can't quite pinpoint why, but I don't post much, so when I do, I am really struggling. It takes a lot for me to work up the courage to post, and when people criticized my writing because I asked a question to get more support, I felt hurt. My logical brain knows that it probably wasn't intentional criticism, but I cannot control my feelings; I can only control my response to them.Now, I realize that everyone does not respond to every post. I know I don't, but I guess I was hoping for more support than I received; maybe a little encouragement too. I wrote the post the way I did so people would have a context for my question, especially since I don't post that much. I guess I'm just expressing unexpected frustration and wondering if anyone is feeling unsupported as well?ÊEveryone is entitled to their own opinion and experience; I'm not posting for the sake of curiosity. I feel like I'm alone with my feelings, and I guess I'm looking for some validation and reassurance that it's worth it to stay on the site...ÊI hope everyone has a great day/night!
