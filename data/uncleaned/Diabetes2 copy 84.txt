help.....   Hi i'm 38yrs old and recently took what i thought was aura (from migraine) vision affected with a halo of colours and blurred vision inside the halo. 1hr later this changed to bright white flashing lights and extreme pain especially in left eye. After 10 mins of pain this all left me and was left with a heavy feeling in my head. I took pins an needles across my upper back a couple of hours later and its still there 5 wks later. Since that i've also developed a burning sensation down my arms and legs. At times my skin feels itchy too. My gp has referred me last week to a neurologist but on checking with hospital the waiting list is 6 mths long. Can anyone shed any light as this will be a very long 6 mths. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.....
