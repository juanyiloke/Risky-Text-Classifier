ÊTroubles with HusbandI'm having issues with my SO. We've been together 5 years and have a 2.5 year old. He has a book on dealing with Borderline and I've talked about my over reactions, etc. He says that I will always find a reason to be mad at him. He's super stressed at work and works long hours. I've suggested he go talk to someone but he won't.ÊI'm nothing like I was when we met. I was skinny, outgoing, ran and lifted weights, was in inccredible shape, etc, etc. Well, between the meds, depression and me just not giving a F***, I've gained a lot of weight. I hate being around other people, I have intense reactions to little things, etc.ÊSo, I don't know what to do. I don't know if he's at his breaking point. When I had the "incident" a week or two ago and he ccame home from work and we talked I broughgt that up and he said don't worry about what I"m thinking, worry about you.ÊI've been off work since Dec. My EI runs out June 20. I don't know if I'm ready to go back to work, but I have a lot of pressue to.Sorry so long. WWYD? Any ideas? I'm at a loss.
