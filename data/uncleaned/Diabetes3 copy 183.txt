New type test stripsI have just noticed on my new prescription that my test strips have been changed. I did have Freedom Lite but this has now changed to Element blood glucose test strips by Neondiagnostics.co.I rang the pharmacy at the surgery and they said they have changed everyones and this is an upgrade. They are giving away free meters for use with the strips. I will collect mine tomorrow. Does anyone else use these Element strips please. Will there be a lancing device and lancets included. The lancets aren't included on my prescription.Thelma.
