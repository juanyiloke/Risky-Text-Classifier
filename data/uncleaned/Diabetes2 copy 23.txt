Should I pursue my symptoms?  4  Hello,So, about 2 weeks ago I went to my doctor because I have been experiencing frequent urinaton for the past month. There I told them I was worried about diabetes (my aunt is the only one in the family that I know of). So he told me to do a urine test, which they said was protocol before further test would be given. Anyways I did the urine test and he told me he did not detect sugar or protein but he did detect a little infection. So, they gave me the medication for UTI and sent me off. After finishing my medication, which made my frequent urination worse, I still experience freqeunt urination. Just yesterday my friend noticed that I peed at 1:30 then at 3:00 and then after drinking a lemonade drink from starbucks I peed again an hour later. I was wondering if I should go back to my doctor for a follow up? also I don't know if this is in my head but I feel like I am experiencing random tingles in my hands and excessive hunger ( I don't know if this is in my head). I say this because few weeks ago I 'started' to have trouble with my eyes which went away.
