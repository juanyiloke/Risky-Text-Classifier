Stage 3b (?)¥	Hi everyone, I've posted before about the mess and mistakes made during my mums diagnosis and how I'm living abroad until August but although I know I cant do anything about things at the moment I'm still craving information. I can't ask my mum because she's too focused to think about predictions and also it seems a lot is still up in the air. She has a massive tumour which has burst from the skin in a small ulceration and has reached her chest wall. As far as I know they didnt find cancer anywhere else after scans but they said although it's not aggressive it's probably been there a long time hence its size and they have to do chemo before surgery. Shes on round 2 /6 and is doing amazingly both mentally and physically, at her last appointment the doctor said the area felt softer and was defo showing signs of shrinking after feeling. I want to hope for the best but Im scared to. When I found out it was my aunt who broke the bad news and not only did she say it'll be bad if they cant shrink it but she pretty much told me it could never be cured and that it'd probably reoccur one day even if they did surgery and got it all out. Am I right not to hope for a remission and hope for as many years as possible?
