How to ask for a raise2012-10-05, 01:23 PMI've been a Business Intelligence Developer level II for a Health Insurance company going on 10 years now. Although I have been in the current position for 2 years, I am underpaid for the area in which I live (DC/Boswash area). The salaries are pretty low here, although the benefits are very good (Paid time off, Health, 401k, etc). The problem now is since Business Intelligence and Healthcare IT is such a hot field, everyone in my department is leaving for better opportunities. We do not offer as much salary wise as other companies so we of course are having trouble backfilling these positions. My workload is just ridiculous. I do have many perks since I live less than 1 mile from my office, but the pay out at other places is becoming more and more inticing. I would like to ask for a raise and perhaps get to a level III. Will this make me look bad if my superiors decline to give me more ? I'd like to stay because of my long tenure with the company, but like I said, the grass is looking very very green on the other side. Things are getting more expensive and the pay just isn't there.How would you handle this situation ? Bring up competing salaries in the area ? Look for another job as a bargaining chip ? With the loss of another supervisor in our department as of yesterday the CEO has now been informed his high priority projects will now be delayed. Does this give me an advantage for asking for a raise right now ?Thanks in advance MX
