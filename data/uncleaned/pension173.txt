Fear of CrimeThe government is spending money on larger mirrors and more smokein a final encouragement to make us believe that 'fear of crime' isunfounded.There is a large conference soon on the matter, no doubt the invitedwill agree with anything expected of them. All in time for a GeneralElection.I fear crime and common sense tells me that it is unsafe to walk downsome streets and in some areas. Then while out that my home willbe broken into. Not that this stops this happening if you are at home.That someone will steal my identity for loans and credit card payments.There are a few more fears - but least I get too boring.Am I alone in that fear?
