JUST Got My Period Back.Hello everyone,I am very new to this site but I have a story that I wanted to share, for which I also need advice one.I have been dealing with an ED for about 2 years now. It all started back in 2013, when I was 27.I have not gotten a period since August of 2013, give or take a few months. Needless to say, I have very much been eating again, which has made me restore my weight (I believe anyways). I JUST got my period back yesterday and am a little concerned with my symptoms.I feel very tired, weak almost. My stomach is killing me (cramps I know, which I am not used to having again) but I feel so painful down there (I use tampons). This is worrying me as I am not sure that this is normal?Do you, or have any of you experienced any sort of symptoms like these since getting your period back? I am sorry if this is a bit TMI, but I just needed some advice and I could not find much online.Thank you.Alexis
