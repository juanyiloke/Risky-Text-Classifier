Will my son ever start to take type 1 serious?Having a bad day today. My son was diagnosed beginning of December as type 1 and just when I think we are getting somewhere I realise he is still cheating ( why? I don't know. As he carb counts and can pretty much have what he wants ) he seems like he can't be bothered to test and that it's such a hassle, which it is, but why can't he see that it's keeping him healthy. He leaves his needles laying about his room - his answer to that is to not go into his room then. Fed up is an understatement right now. He "forgot" his meter yesterday when going to a routine check up, he admitted he did it on purpose as we were leaving the room. He was like the model patient in front of the nurses and I honestly believed he was until I checked his meter at home and realised the lack of results.When he's running high he is loud and aggressive and not likeable. I just want him to understand the seriousness of the condition!
