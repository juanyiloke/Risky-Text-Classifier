ÊLove my mom, but she is part of my traumatic experiences.After losing my father to cancer, and my grandma to old age, I feel myself wanting to be in close contact with family. Lately, though, it bothers me when I stop and think about my past, and how my mother has been responsible for a good portion of the trauma in my childhood. It kills me to think that the woman that I yearn to be in the same town as, and long to spend valuable time with, is the very same woman who used to throw fits, run out in traffic, call me names, yell at me until I was in a fetus position, threaten to kill herself and make me chase her down. I know I can't hold any of this against her either, but I do feel resentment towards her. I don't want to resent her. She is getting old, and I can never be sure how long I have with her. I've lost two jobs because of my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and I nearly lost my most recent job too. I've become like my own mother, and I fear what would happen if I ever became a mother. Would I be just like her? Would my children grow up to resent me? With all this being said, how many of you are in close contact with people who caused you trauma? Do you resent them, and if so, how do you cope with your resentment?
