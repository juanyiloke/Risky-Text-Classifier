ÊWhat do your voices say?my voices consist of a few different people , some I've heard once, others on a daily basis .. first time was a woman on a microphone , followed by an audience ..They made it sound like I was entered into some Chairty run for children. I hear mainly 2 males. One constantly screams , the other is his buddy , they say how much they hate me, how stupid I am , that I'm worthless, a freak, an animal, useless, an idiot, liar, piece of ****, that I suck, a smoker, drug addict , they say ****(ing)in between each word they say ... I also hear my neighbors , family , and friends, and recently my girlfriend .. I believe what I hear is actually some kind of thought they've had or something they've said in real life played back in my head ... I've heard my neighbors say how much they hate me . Others I've heard them talking in conversation to each other, like one time I could hear the parents fighting with their son while he was high/drunk , yelling at him . They mentioned me saying "do you want to be like our neighbors kid ? staying at home at his parents doing nothing but smoke marijuana in their backyard " something like that . I've heard my mom crying , my dad saying things he hates about me , I can't even mention it in public, my sister talking to her bboyfriend how she hates me . It's seriously so real , like it's something they've actuallly said . Other times random voices come about , only when I'm having a serious episode .. when its bad it's like I can hear them surround the house, mimicking knocks on the walls or footsteps ... Other times they were inside the house . You name it Ive heard the most hateful **** in my head for SO long it's like I don't even care anymore . The worst is I think everybody says **** about me now and I'm so paranoid . derogatory voices really take away any confidence or self esteem you might have left . I think it's electronic harassment more than psychosis tho . My voices have had parties that sing s not " he's a jolly good fellow " but instead "for he's a ****ing *****, and no body can deny" , they chanted this as I got on medication ... They've made it sound I ruined the internet , and had about 30 different people say what They think about me .. the voices have done everything to induce fear in me. Could be all apart of some conspiracy . . I had a drug induced psychosis by the way .. might be permanent . I still have 4 months of forced medication before I truly find out ...
