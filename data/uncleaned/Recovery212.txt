  How I managed a down day and am better today ...________________________________________For lots of reasons, yesterday was such a down day for me. I felt depressed from the get-go and it lasted pretty much all day. I made a decision early in the day that I would try my level best to not make too much of it and just roll with it. Not easy to do, but I stuck with it. One of my fears is that when I feel this way it will last FOREVER. It never does but I forget that ...Last night before I went to bed I was listening to some old songs on YouTube. One song lead to another I heard a lot of songs I loved and went to bed happy. I slept great and this morning I feel good again.
