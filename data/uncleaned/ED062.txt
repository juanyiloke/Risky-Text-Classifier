looking for supportI have been in the refeeding process for almost a month now. I want to recover from anorexia but everyday is such a struggle. I don't know how to act around food and have lost all control. Since I have restricted for so long, I binge and eat until I'm sick even if I wasnt hungry. I breakdown and feel guilty afterwards. I'm scared because I don't want to develop another disorder. I suffer from depression and have cut myself off from friends and family. I'm too ashamed and become anxious/overwhelmed at the thought of seeing them. going in public is awful and i only wear big tshirts and shorts/sweatpants. All of the weight I have regained (with more to go) has all gone to my stomach. I look pregnant and it makes me feel disgusting. Sorry for venting but i'm just looking for any support or tipsThanks
