Murmur and Anxiety. Ê10    So, ever since I got told back in October that I'm on a waiting list to see a cardiologist, I have to say the least been paranoid about my heart. I have been having really bad panic and anxiety attacks for nearly a year now after the death of my grandfather and the stress of my job has not helped much either, I didn't really think much of palpations or my heart when I was having these attacks until I got told to see a cardiologist, anyway long story short, in January I went to the doctor because everything was starting to consume me, the doctor told me he could hear a mild murmur, because of the attacks I've been having its making my murmur a lot more noticeable, but its nothing too worry about. I've basically have had this murmur my whole life but never knew about it. Ever since I've grown pretty paranoid about it, some   I don't think much at all about it but today is one of those   when I am. Since knowing about all this I concentrate a lot on my heart, my councillor told me the cardiologist has seen my blood work, ECG results and if it was serious they would have sent for me asap. Its pretty annoying because if i feel unwell or out of sorts i think its something too do with my heart. Everyone has tried telling me this is something I've had my whole life but because of the mention of cardiologist and the finding out of the murmur its made me think there's something going on when its all anxiety. Anyone else on here have the same thing? How do you deal? X
