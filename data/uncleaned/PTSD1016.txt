Hey! I just want to ask that is it possible to have a trauma from childhood that can affect me 12 years later? I was moved into foster family when I was almost two years, and I'm told that I didn't speak for almost a year and I never smiled or laughed. And now I'm 14, I'm struggling with depression, anxiety, self harm, suicidal thoughts, insomnia etc And I can't remember much from my childhood, I don't remember my first schoolday, or any birthday parties, I barely remember nothing And sometimes I have nightmares, that could be from my childhood (like abusing, abandonment, alcohol etc) And three years ago my dad passed away, and it was really big shock for me And I don't really remember anything from past three years, or before, it just feels like all the memories are gone, especially the good ones So is it possible to have trauma from childhood that can affect years later?
