Finding My Way Back From IsolationHi Everyone,This is my first post and I am doing this as a way of helping myself out of this depressive state of being.  I am so very tired and feel like I just want to stay in my bedroom and sleep however I am a sole parent to 3 wonderful children (22months, 11yrs and 16yrs) and I must function not only to meet my responsibilities but because I love my children and want to be the best that I can be for them and myself.  I have isolated myself socially for a very long time.  I realise I need to makes steps to remedy this and recently started going to AA meetings however I find them overwhelming on every level. I have been sober for 1 month and 17 days and I am grateful AA and intend to keep going however I haven't been for 3 weeks now and am trying to work up the courage to go back.  I have always used alcohol and pot to deal with depression since I was a teenager and it has only ever made things worse so I am determined to walk down a new path from now on. I thought that by talking to people online it may be a start to finding my way back from the isolation I have dealt myself over the years and might lead me to build up the courage to reach out to people in the real world.  I'm not going to hide who I am anymore, I have to be honest with myself and others so I can move forward. Does anyone have any advice about how to form new connections with people after actively avoiding connections for so long?
