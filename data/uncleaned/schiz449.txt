ÊI want another attempt off medsi want a trial off meds. I attempted this before once with the supervision of my pdoc about a year ago. I did this because I was in remission for a total of 4 years and it was my only episode. I was only on 5mg Abilify so I went off it cold turkey. Big mistake started feeling irritable, unable to sit still, very very impatient, upset at stupid things, crying at work for no reason and just unable to do anything with my life. Lasted 3 weeks before I said need to go back on them. Of course there was no psychosis but I had no choice but to get back on them. This time my pdoc suggests (he's a different one) to go off it slowly not cold turkey. I am considering this option but right now I think I will wait just one more year. I mean whats one more year right?
