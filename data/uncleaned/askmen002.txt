Reference Issue2015-03-07, 06:33 PMSo, I have been at my current employer for three years. Unfortunately, my department learned a few months ago that we lost contract and most of us in the department would be affected. Most of my department has been eliminated by lay offs. I still have a job until the April though. I went to my former supervisor for a reference, and he said yes but he seemed hesitant. I thought he mentioned something about saying that I should also look for a "secondary" reference just in case. I do not know if it is because my company has a policy against management being used as references for future employers or whether it's a problem with me personally. However, a reference is so important. Should I ask someone else, or leave it as is?
