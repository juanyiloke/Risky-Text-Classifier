I wonder. People say it is selfish to commit suicide. In my case for one reason, it would be. But, in general, is it not selfish of other people to want you to stay? Again not so much in my case as I have no family or friends. But, people only want you not to kill yourself so that they don't feel the same level of pain that you feel daily. I'm sorry, am I missing something here? It's ok for me to suffer as I have been doing for the past 15 years, but it's not ok for you to suffer? Where is the logic in this? Someone please explain.I used to think the thoughts would pass, but its been so many years I am ready to do it. I have gone to see a doctor and was already diagnosed clinically depressed. Since then I have been through a drug addiction and now in recovery i have never been closer to doing it. So ready to leave and even have the substance on hand to do it. At the same time I dont want to do it. In reality I want it all, my family back and to be back on drugs. But suicide seems like the happier way out, which is what I always aim for.
