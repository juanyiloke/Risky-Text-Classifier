ÊHow do you get over it?I've been abused sexually for many years, starting when I was just a baby. Of course I not remember this and I didn't even know until last year. I didn't remember it and I have DID so I created these alters to survive. It was by my biological father. I have no contact with him and haven't for thirteen years. I just don't know how to get over this.ÊWhen I was 8, my cousin did some pretty awful things to me. He was 16. I'm not believed about this by my mom. Only Sue believes me that this happened IRL. My mom was watching his three children (I'm 23 and he's almost 31 now). The first day when he picked up the kids I was fine, it didn't affect me. The second day though, I started having really bad flashbacks. To the point that I could feel what was happening to my body. And it was all about him doing those bad things.ÊI feel stupid by still being totally terrified of him. I'm terrified that he will do it again. I don't even know if I'm his only victim, he has two sisters and he has a daughter.ÊHow do you get over something so terrifying?
