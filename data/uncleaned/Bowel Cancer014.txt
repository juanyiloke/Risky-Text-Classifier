What to eat??I was just wondering if anybody would like to share recipes to help with either diet with a new stoma or those which help post reversal? I have often felt too ill to cook but had several offers from people to cook for me only to have to decline due to diet restrictions in both cases. I found that both diets (with and post stoma) are so different and while we have all been provided with food lists re what to eat and avoid eating....many here may have tailored recipes to create meals that are both pallitable and as anti carcinogenic as possible that may be enjoyed by others. I know that I have discovered several new vegetables while trying to cut down on meat intake and would love to hear what others cook being mindful of restrictions and guidelines to minimise bowel cancer reoccurance. Wouldn't it be great to print off something that a relative could make to help on a bad day..... Not sure if this is a runner or not?What do people think?Stella
