Fear of an attack  23  Since being diagnosed with anxiety/panic attacks and asthma last year, I live in fear of an attack.I think it's due to not being 100% certain of the signs and symptoms of an asthma attack compared to that of a panic attack - is anyone able to help?Also if it is asthma and I don't have an inhaler with me will I die?My life has changed so much and I just want to go back to being 'normal' and knowing how to cope.I wake up every morning dreading the day ahead and its impacted so much on my personal and working life.I feel like I'm losing everything - my self, my confidence, my relationships with family and friends, my job etc
