Is it allergies or a cold?________________________________________For the past couple of days my throat has been really sore and swollen. All the lymph nodes in my throat are swollen and my sinuses are swollen as well. I keep having mucus drip down my throat. I tried a neti pot in the past but all it did was dry my sinuses out too much irritating them even more. My throat hurts constantly. It's much worse if I eat, drink or talk. My voice is really hoarse. I have no fever. Three days before this I kept on being woken up in the mornings by bad asthma attacks and had congestion. I've had to use my inhaler more when I go outside. I'm not sure if this is allergies or a cold? All I know is that I'm miserable! My doctor's officeis closed until September 15th and we don't have urgent care. Clinics are like doctor's offices here. They can only examine but can't run any tests and they can write prescriptions.
