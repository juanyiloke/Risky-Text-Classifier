  No booze for 2 weeks = positive frame of mind!I'm new  here at TTL but wanted to share this as it might help someone who has been stuck in a similar cycle...I've battled depression  almost all of my life (I'm 30) with some degree of success, however recently I was hospitalised for about a month, split from my boyfriend, lost my job after 6 years and gained extra weight due to new medication (Mirtazapine = serious case of the munchies). Faced with the prospect of having no money, no job, no social interaction, no hope of ever finding a partner because I'm so fat and have nothing to offer...I turned to drink. Not the wisest decision but at the time I didnt care. I know full well that alcohol is a depressant but what do I care? I just want to be drunk and I'll deal with the comedown later. I needed to do it to get it out of my system. I needed to wallow in my misery for a while, so that I could eventually realise (again) that I want more from life. I've not had a drink for over 2 weeks and already I feel sooo much better. Today, for the first time in about 3 months, my mind feels clear, I'm even going to work out to myexercise  DVD which I havent done for so long. When I exercise my mood improves and I even (shock, horror!) feel positive . So I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news (lol) but exercise REALLY DOES help. I'm quite possibly the most cynical, negative, 'eye-rolling-yeah-right' person I know, so I point blank refused to accept that exercise could help me. Until I tried it. So while I'm feeling energised and dare I say, positive, I'm going to don my most unflattering, unforgiving tracksuit and jump around like a mad woman for 40 minutes in the hope that it will ensure my positive mood lasts a few days longer. I hope that by reading this maybe you'll be inspired to try something new i.e. exercise to help yourself to get well again. Thanks for reading
