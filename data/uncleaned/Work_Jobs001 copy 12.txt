Mediation________________________________________I am due to attend a mediation meeting for work at a date to be arranged. I've been sent an email from the mediator (external) asking for a list of any grievances I have. The mediation is between myself and one of the directors of the small business I work for. My understanding is that once I submit these they will be shared with the other party in the mediation. Is this correct?From experience, the director will fabricate some excuses/lies in response to any grievances. I would feel more confident of throwing all the issues out on the day rather than giving this director a heads up so that they can get advise on how to get around my issues.Any advice?
