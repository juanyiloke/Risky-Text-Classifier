Bad cough, can't breath and clear thin vomit  10  I've had a cough for about 3 weeks now where it started just as a tickle and I started to get coughing fits very quickly. I went to the gp where he thought I has whooping cough even though I had my vac for it. However it's progressively got worse.  I'm coughing about 15 times as day where I start to turn purple and vomit clear runny thin liquid (only about half a cupful) and then after I literally cannot breath and I'm garsping for breath (my hole airway feels like it's closing) after a while this tends to go but during this process I feel quite shaky. The cough can be triggered by cold water, deal breaths. Or even swallowing. When I'm about to cough all my eyes water and I get shortness of breath and I've tried so hard not to cough to make it worse. Even tipping my head back sparks it off. I've just been landed my dream job and working 6 / 7 days a week and can't take time off by the time I get back the doctors are closed. I would really appreciate some help or of anyone has suffered from this before as I don't want to go to a & e if it's not serious .Thanks
