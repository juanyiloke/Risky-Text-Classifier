Asthma Problem  9  I was diagnosed last year with asthma, i am currently on Symbicort 2 times a day at morning and night. i can also use it when i feel i need it.since around 8.45 today i have now developed a cough, tightness in my chest and wheezing, neither the symbicort or ventolin reliever are easing it. I have tried to get an appointment to see my asthma nurse - she is on holiday for a week and a half! was told there are no doctors appointments available either! Getting on well here! then i was told to ring at 12.30 and speak with a doctor!
