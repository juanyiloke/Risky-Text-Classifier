Goals for 2015That time again, what are your goals for 2015.I'll start, going to keep it simple and not too ambitious.Spend more quality time with my kid...plan to take a month off over the summer...they won't be small for ever as the saying goes.One night a month out with the Mrs....some may laugh but we could go months without a night outDecent holiday this year.Lose weight, exercise moreStart using and learning about that SLR cameraGet more certifications at workCook a more varied menu.
