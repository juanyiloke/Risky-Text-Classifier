My diabetes journey.Hi Everybody:The first week of July is my 24th year as a type 2 diabetic, My only anti-diabetes med is no less than 100 minutes/day of stair-running. I say only because my daily meals have always been mostly carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, grains (rice and corn), nuts, beans, roots. It is common knowledge that carbohydrates are bad for diabetics because they raise fasting and post-meal blood sugar levels. I always get them when I get up in the morning and 2 hours after each meal. I eat only 2 meals/day, no snacks, and I drink water only, usually between meals.Why do I eat a lot of carbohydrates if they are bad for me? I have always been a lazy person. I figured that carbohydrates are easy and fast to digest. Yes, they surely create high blood sugar readings but my daily exercise has been making them short-lived. From my long experience with my diabetes, I am learning that the high blood sugar levels I have been getting are harmless. I don't have any diabetes complications yet, have never had any hypo problems, and I am as healthy as I want to be.Please note that I am not encouraging anybody to follow my way of managing my diabetes. It may not work for you. But I am encouraging you to discover for yourself the best way you can easily do to stay healthy, strong, happy, and have a long life.Enjoy life always!!!Bonny C DamoclesMale, 79 years old, 138 lbs, 5'7"First fasting blood sugar reading in July 1991 was 468 mg/dlAfter 10 days of 120 minutes/day of stair-running, my fasting bs readings were in the low 130's mg/dlMost of past A1c's were between 5.2% and 6.3%, the one I got on April 10, 2015 was 5.6%I don't take any pharma drugs for any health problems because our family MD believes that I don't need them.
