I'm new to all of this...I used to have anorexia, now I have gone the completely opposite direction. I binge eat all the time. I think about food all the time, what to eat what not to eat, what I will or won't eat, my weight, etc. . When I'm not hungry at all. I don't want to do it. Even in the very moment that I am doing it. I don't want to spend the money and I don't want to eat the food. But I do anyway. The more I think about not wanting to do it, the more I eat. I've gained weight as a result of this. I don't kno why I'm doing it or what to do to stop this.
