I just signed up here. I just wrote to the good Samaritans also. i'm a little bit panicking so i needed to write more so i searched for suicide forums and this was one..i dont know what to do. i keep thinking all i have to do is hang myself and it would be over, all of this. even this suicide debate in my head is making me want to kill myself just to stop that! i'm worthless, i'm ugly, i'm a terrible person, im a terrible friend, i have awful thoughts, i am rotten, i'm fat, i'm worthless. i want someone to just push me, tell me to kill myself, tell me how worthless i am i want to hear it.
