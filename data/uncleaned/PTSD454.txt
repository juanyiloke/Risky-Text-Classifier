ÊFeeling Frustrated and HurtHi all. I recently started seeing a brand new psychologist. I prefer psychologists because I don't want to be put on any more medications, and social workers seem limited in what they can do with me. I have also had a positive experience in the past with a psychologist but unfortunately she lives too far away for me to see her now.ÊSo this new woman, who is older (70's) seemed to be very experienced and professional and I made an appointment to see her. I didn't notice it the first time, but the second time I visited her, she appeared to be dozing off. I actually asked her if she were falling asleep and she looked right at me and said no. But the third time I came in for my session it happened again. She would be scribbling away then her eyes would flutter, close and her head would drop briefly before she would shake herself awake and start writing again.I began to feel frustrated because if I asked her if she were falling asleep, she would probably only deny it again. I would do things like shuffle my feet or open my purse to make her wake up. The last time I went I was quite emotional, because I was talking about some distressing stuff and crying. I happened to look up to see she was fighting sleep again.. I didn't know what to do. I felt so lost, and frustrated to see her dozing off when I needed her to hear me and respond to me. She would usually say something brief, but I realized that despite going to her for four weeks, I was feeling more concerned about how to keep her awake than the problems I had come in to work on. Has this happened to anyone else, and how did you handle it?
