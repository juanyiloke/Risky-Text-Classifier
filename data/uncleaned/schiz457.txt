ÊBeing apathetic.I told the LD community nurse who enthusiastically takes me for my monthly depot injection that I'm totally apathetic and have lost interest in life and don't enjoy it anymore, sleeping 16/17 hours a day and she didn't give a flying fuck as long as they give me that fucking injection a month and if I refuse I've breached my CTO and then have to deal with the police kicking my door down 'again'!!!!ÊI told her that I would rather be delusional and happy then being emotionally flat all the time and she said they can't allow that even though I'm not a danger to other people. Sick of this .
