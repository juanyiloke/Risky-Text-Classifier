First day of work________________________________________I start my first ever day at work tomorrow. I'm seventeen and have never had a serious job before, I'll be doing my training day for Dunnes Stores tomorrow and I'm completely over-thinking everything. What if my colleagues don't like me? Should I tuck my shirt in or leave it out? I have extreme anxiety and I worry about the most stupid things ever and was just wondering if you could give me some advice in hope that it will help me because I really don't want to ruin my chances at a potentially longtime opportunity just because I over think.
