  Tiger Hugs!Hello!So I just wanted to post a little something here, for two main reasons. First being that, even though I still have a verylong  way to go, and apart from the horrific side effects of the medication I faced earlier on during the last two weeks. I feel better. Not great, not 100%, but better. Partly thanks to the meds I guess, partly to my own stuff I'm doing, but also because of you guys here! (Three reasons why im posting here then...) So Thank you for all the help  you have given me so far TTL! And I hope I have made some people maybe smile or hopefully feel a little better too!And I've just thought of another reason (Spanish inquisition sketch anyone?) that I should appreciate my progress so as not to help all the dark  thoughts win over and make me feel like I have accomplished nothing. So yeah, I'm doing ok right now :) and I am putting in place (albeit slowly) things to help me more! Exercise regime, swimming, charity work etc. Now this brings me onto my main reason (one of the many) why I am posting. As well as doing my exercise to obtain a better looking body so I have increased confidence levels, I have aquired a Slendertone belt thingy! I didnt buy it, my step father had one but never used it. So I now have it! and I wanted to know if anyone here has used anything like these things? and if they work etc? Lemme know!Thats all I think....
