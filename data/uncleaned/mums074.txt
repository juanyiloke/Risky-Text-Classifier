Hi my dd first two bottom teeth came about 3 weeks ago with very little problems.ÊToday she is very clingy and just wanting to sleep on me all day. She has eaten her breakfast and lunch very hungrily and had milk feeds off me but hard to tell how much she had as she keeps falling to sleep.ÊWhen she us awake she us smiley and chatty. Had a little play. She has no temperature but her wee smells really strong. But I can't see it in the nappy so I'm assuming it's clear and not dark.ÊHer top gums look swollen to me and she keeps smacking them with her tongue if that makes sense.ÊWhat do you think? Is all this signs of teething or would you be booking her in with dr?dont want to take her out if not needed x
