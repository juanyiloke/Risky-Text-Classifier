I can't stop eating junkHi, I'm 29 years old, 5'2" in height and weigh 46.5kg. I was recently diagnosed with underactive thyroid and I read that hypothyroid people are usually overweight. I've always been slim and petite so that aspect of my illness has never registered. Whenever I've gone to thyroid support meetings the other members immediately guess that I'm hyperthyroid and are shocked when I say that I'm the opposite. I like to look nice when I go anywhere (I don't obsess about it) but I don't like it when I get young girls glaring at me or men looking at me. I have also had unwanted attention from other men and I tend to avoid them when they say/do certain things.I have no desire to eat - when I say I have no desire to eat it's mainly where I have no desire to eat healthy foods. The only foods I'm likely to touch are:I have been measuring my BMI but I haven't lost a lot of weight and when I spoke to my employment assessor she was worried that I am now in the underweight range. I don't know how to go about telling my GP that I have this unstoppable craving for sweet, salty, milky foods because I know that I will instantly be in their bad books.Can anyone advise why I am so addicted to the foods I listed? Could it be a deficiency in a vitamin/mineral? I already know I am Vitamin D and iron deficient but my GP and endocrinologist haven't checked me for any other deficiencies and I really feel that they should.
