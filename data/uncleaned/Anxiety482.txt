New to Meds for Generalized Anxiety...I am 29 years old and was diagnosed with GAD and some OCD.Ê Ok...I've had it my whole life and I knew that, but I've never decided to go on medication.Ê I have struggled with addictions and anxiety my entire life, but I have been off of drugs for over 5 years now, but struggle with crippling impending doom anxiety.Ê I went to a Psychiatrist who prescribed me Gabapentin for mood stabilizer and anxiety and Lexapro.Ê I can't even tell you if it helped, I felt sweaty, racy, weird, and just depressed and funny.Ê The thing is, she prescribed these meds to me before I had a psych. eval, so I don't even know if they were right for me.Ê She said she would not prescribe benzos for me because of my history of addiction, but nothing was working!Ê I'd rather be on something addictive that actually works.Ê She then prescribed me Hydroxicine for breakthrough anxiety which made me sleepy and propranolol which made me angry, sweaty and WEIRD!Ê I feel defeated, so I tapered off...now i'm back to my anxious self.Ê Do I get a second opinion?Ê What do I do!!??Ê Just not medicate?Ê i'm really sad, angry and irritated with this whole medication process.Ê
