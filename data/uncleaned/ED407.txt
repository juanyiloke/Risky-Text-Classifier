ÊInternational flight - how do I take my diet pills?I'm travelling on an international trip and I need to take my over the counter diet pills from gnc and I don't know how to take them. I'm traveling with my family and worried I'll get stopped at customs. What will I do if that happens??i just don't feel like I can go without them. I could pack them in an unlabeled container but I risk being stopped and asked what that is. Argh.ÊDisclaimer: please don't give me a lecture on them. My pdoc knows I take them and is not bothered so I guess they're fine!
