sleeping troubles & buzzing in head + pins & needlesOver the last couple of weeks when just about to fall to sleep I get this buzzing sensation in my head and like an electricity jolt throughout my body and then tingling in both hands and feet.I am very anxious at the minute and even more anxious when trying to fall asleep.It takes me about 3 hours to get just a few hours of sleep as jusy keep tossing and turning and waiting really for these buzzes to come.I am currently on 30 mg mirtizapine & 45mg busperine.Has anybody else had anything like this.It only happens at night time just before I am going to sleep and very frightening really.If anybody else has suffered this please reassure me that it is just anxiety and hopefullt it will pass but it happens every night and sometimes numerous times per night for a long time now
