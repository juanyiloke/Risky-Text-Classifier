Help/ Info required please.....  21  Hi guysI have been having some serious issues over the last couple of months. Thought I had labrythitis (inner ear infection with vertigo and dizziness ) however seen neurologist and she wasn't convinced.She thinks it could be a silent migrane however the more I think about it every time I feel dizzy and light headed I always rush for food anything at all chocolate sandwich anything!The weird thing is with I check my blood ( I am type 2) everything is fine slightly high but fine usually 8 o 10 ishCan anyone else if all this could be caused by being diabetic ? Please see below my symptoms and comments/ thoughts appreciatedLight headedBlurred vision ( eye test perfect )Slight vertigo but more blurred vision
