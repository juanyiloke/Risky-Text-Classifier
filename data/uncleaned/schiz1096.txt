Hello EveryoneI just registered here, I am new and I hope to meet some new people that share the same issues as me. I'll tell a little about myself..I am a paranoid schizophrenic, I do not take my meds because I am afraid of them. I have a long list of fears which include, fear of being poisoned, fear of food alergy(even if i just ate it yesterday i still panic over it, I have to watch my food being cooked to be sure there was nothing added to it meant to kill me), fear of leaving my house(i have overcome that for the most part, i can leave but panic over it still), fear im being watched, fear of looking at the sky, fear of people, fear of anything out of my daily routine.I cannot change soaps, i have to eat the same foods(about 10 different ones), i have at least 3 massive panic attacks a day. my symptoms are the usual as what ive seen other members post on this forum. thats just the beginning of my issues...yep theres more. I struggle with it daily and it torments me. But I hope to make friends on here, i really dont have many friends because everyone thinks im a "freak" anyway thanks for having me and i hope i posted this in the right spot.
