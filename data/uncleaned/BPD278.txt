Êadvice pleaseI have a friend with EUPD and depression, im in the early stages of learning about it but just want to know how a person is supposed to act around people with the above mentioned disorders, im not being ignorant on the matter, I just want to learn as much as I can so I can support her asap, she is having a really bad time of late with it all and I just want to be there and know how to be when im around her,Êalong with the above she also suffers really bad night terrors, I dont really know where to fully start with whats going on here, I could start a new thread explaining it all but where do I go to post it ? its a really long story with whats happened in the past 2 years, I need to get my story out there and hopefully be pointed to the things ive done wrong and what to do to start making things better for her.
