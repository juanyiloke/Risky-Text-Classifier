understand the risks!!! I know many people who suffer with asthma, who often fail to manage their condition properly. To be honest for a long time asthma was just an everyday thing in family life. Im not a sufferer myself but many of my family are.However on 30/11/05 Haveing not suffererd an attack for 6 years, we sadly lost my sister ema to an acute broncial attack. She was 18. Since that day, i often find myself tellng my pals off for not taking proper care of their condition.Asthma can be a much more serious condition if its not managed properly and i just want every1 to take heed and dont take the condition for granted..
