ÊI should have diedIt has been too long. Forgive me for typos; I'm writing off of my smartphone.ÊI've been like this for over 5 years now. I have seen myself as worthless for that long. Regardless of if I actually deserve such a fate, I've been wasting valuable thought processes on this shot for long enough to make me a stunted, unless individual. I recently broke up with my girlfriend for purely selfish reasonsShe found out that I had essentially cheated on her four months ago about two days after. I want to die. There is no reason for me to keep going. I offer nothing. I bring nothing to the table. I should have killed myself 4 years ago when I initially planned on it. I am worthless. Anyone on this site who knows who I am knows this. I want to die.
