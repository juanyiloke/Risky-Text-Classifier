An Aha MomentI am laughing at/with myself right now. It has just occurred to me, at 51 years old, that I can do whatever the hell I want to do. I don't have to kill myself to be free. I can go camping instead. And toast marshmallows and eat as much chocolate as I want. I am free. I have choices.ÊThis...this is what my one part that I like so much has been trying to tell me. Not to run AWAY. Just to be free.Wow. I...all of me...is having a very good moment right now. And I am grateful for that.
