Freestyle libre. Feeling luckyDo you guys remember my huge upset when I was given the libre to trial from consultant and the sensor came out, and how freestyle were lovely in that they replaced it for me free of charge? Well, I'm now a customer. I'm able to buy the sensors. Consultant is letting me borrow the scanner a bit longer because he has no sensors left anyway. So I'm able to buy the sensors. Don't know if I will be able to buy the handset when it comes time to give mine back. I'm feeling quite lucky. I was so upset when it broke the first time. But it seems that good has definitely come out of it.
