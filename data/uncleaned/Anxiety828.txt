ÊWired and Kidney Failure made me feel this wayHi!I had Kidney failure in the month of October last year. I am only taking three pills. Something for my diabetes and one for blood pressure/cholesterol and last my alprazolam for sleep and anxiety.ÊLong story I was on so many name brand meds. that my kidneys failed and now I am down to nothing. I have not felt this way in years. Like learning to cope with all these new feelings I have. Like being back in school, years ago and I am not sure where I am going and what to do with it all. Scary yet very distracting to me. I hate it, just want to feel normal again, and I guess what that being said I am not even sure what that is. I guess I feel alone and overwhelmed, yet I have tons of friends, family that listen, but are they. My doctors think I am doing great and I am but I am not. Has anyone ever gone through this at all? Just need to know that I am not alone and that you understand.
