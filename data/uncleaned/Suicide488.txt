Living In PainUnknownDay By Day Seeing other people have a great time wishing I can Have That. Wishing i was cared for, Wishing i Could be happy, i Guess God didnt want me to be happy. I hurt myself to make other people happy like my Mom , my brothers, etc. I never got anything i wanted, i never got treated the way my brothers were treated, ive been abused in my childhood and no one has done nothing to help me, Counselor keep saying things are going to get better but yet its getting worse the more time pass by i just feel like i shouldnt belong here i feel like its gonna make more people happy if i didnt exist. I hurt people that didnt deserve it But I guess its my Time to Go I hear The Devil Calling out for me.
