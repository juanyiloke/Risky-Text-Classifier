I got Diabetes in 2007 It was chronic ave glucose 400 or higher for 5 yearsLet me tell you how I beat diabetes I weighed 330 lbs My thyroid freak out causing me to gain over 90 lbs in less then a year.I was told if I didn't lose weight right away I would most pass away from stroke or heart attack. And the neuorpthy would continue to cause permanent lower legg aand feet nerve damage to where amputation would most likely be needed to to remove any gang green they may occur from it. So as I loved my food I started getting seziures the 3 grandma eziures I had knocked out 2 of my teeth from falling forward not being able to control my fall. No teeth no food well I now weigh 225lbs lost 105 lbs in 14 months that when i checked my blood sugar it read 105 I got chills all over couldn't believe it the first time in over 5 years I was diabetes free my neuropthy is still here and does flare up if I eat sugar. If your over weight and you lost over 100 lbs like I did the inn strength it gives you is what you are dreaming of now if you obesity is out of control like mine was. I hope to hear your weight loss story. Take care Eric K
