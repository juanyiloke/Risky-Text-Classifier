Successful Single Men.2013-01-25, 08:51 AMAll the people already have spouses and kids as of 30 if not many years sooner from my age group. I personally do not have either or want either or. I don’t want to have a companion or spouse. The goal is to be a successful and well-paid bachelor and that is all. I never wanted to have another person in my life with me as it is non-liberating. I am a celibate man and remain a tactful person without the want for company. I consider myself enlightened for the abovementioned.Loners win out. Most people want to have a family. They waste ~20 years of the world’s time to start one including making men wait it out. The sooner they’re out of the picture the easier it is for people that want to succeed to actually do so. For some men Bachelorhood is a time period; for some it’s a way of life with no parallel. If a person gets to 30 without commitment or children then he or she is in superior position for a successful future in the same vein of existence.Anyone else only want to be successful and isolated from other people and their Egotistical complaints?
