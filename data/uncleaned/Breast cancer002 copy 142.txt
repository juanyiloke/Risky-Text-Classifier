Worried about white speck on nipple¥	Roughly a week ago I noticed a white speck or dot on my nipple right on the end, there is only one and it looks like a white head that you get on skin elsewhere really. I'm so scared this could be some kind of cancer of the milk duct or Paget's disease or some kind of calcification which I've read could be cancer. If you google white speck on nipple it comes up with blocked milk duct and all sites that come up are ones to do with pregnancy but I have never had children and I'm def not pregnant now. Its not the natural bumps you gets round the nipple either, the white speck isn't even particularly raised.So scared, my boyfriend was diagnosed with testicular cancer about a month ago and we thought his symptoms would be nothing, I think this has me panicing than ever that mine will turn out to be something sinister, plus I'm still being bullied at work and suffering panic attacks about that, I just dont think I can cope worrying that I have breast cancer too in top of my boyfriend and work :-( Sorry for posting when I'm currently just at the worrying stage I can remove if inappropriate
