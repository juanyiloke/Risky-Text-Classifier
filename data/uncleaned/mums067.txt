My dd will be 2.8 when her new sibling arrives in July. We would like to buy her something nice as a present as she's already a bit worked up about it and being 'special'. Not sure what I get her what do your toddlers like? She already has baby and pushchair, some happyland bits, bricks and Lego, plastic food and a small kitchen, lots of jigsaws, a table and chairs. Although we have outside space it is a sloped Garden so a trampoline will be difficult. She is quite girly I suppose likes pink and princesses but equally happy to play with cars and get muddy. Would love to know what your little ones love
