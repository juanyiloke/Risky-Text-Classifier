Even the strong struggleI have been doing so well. Been eating around 2 meals if not more plus a snack. Also been gaining weight and have for the most part been trying to except it even though I still don't like my body. Yesterday, I was reading something about my lil sis, who was struggling really bad last year. It hurt reading it because I wasn't there to support her and I feel like that was all my fault.I never slept a wink and now I'm back to struggling again. I'm also very close to cutting, which I've already done once on Saturday after5 years of being clean. The tendency of restricting and cutting are so strong right now. I don't know if I can make it through the day without doing both
