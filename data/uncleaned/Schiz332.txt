Dear "Writers"I'm getting real sick of your crud making all of these fictional serial killers having sz. I tried to read Red Dragon and it was some dude who was sz and abused who was a serial killer. I know that you were trying to pose him as a somewhat sympathetic figure but no. Just no. I haven't read a ton of these mystery thrillers but I'm including the writers of Criminal Minds on this one. I might be wrong and someone please correct me if I am but they keep talking about someone having a psychotic break and using other terms that remind me of terms associated with sz. I went through a phase where I read about serial killers and it seemed to me a lot of them did it just because they liked it and/or got sexual gratification from it. I will admit that there is a lot that I don't know and you very well might be right in your terminology and if that is the case I heartily apologize for including you. But to all of the writers whether of novels, tv shows, movies, or anything else who portray us as a bunch of murderous psychos when really we are probably more afraid of you than you are of us (pretty much the definition of paranoia if you ask me).Beans to you. Beans to you.Ok, I don't have huge hallucinations but when I start to have an attack I feel like some of the colors are after me. Like the color white. White is everywhere. Shining off leaves, painted on walls, there are even white pebbles. I'm as pasty white as they come so I see my arms and shoulders in my peripheral vision and because they are behind me but keep following me (because, of course, my arms are attached) I feel like they are chasing me.What I've started to do is put a sleeping mask on when that starts up. I can't see white or any other color. I wear it until it goes away or I get really bored. If it comes back I put it back on. I think of it like the hood on a falcon.Â
