UK To Beijing With Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin)Hi guys,I would like your advice with regards to any friends or family you may know that has Type 1 Diabetes (insulin dependant). Luckily in the UK the NHS supports Diabetes with free medication and I am wondering how that is supported in Beijing.I am aware it's not free but any advice on who to contact or what to do when it comes to getting more medication for this would be a great help.Has anyone ever had Insulin sent from their home country to Beijing? I won't be coming to Beijing for a Holiday, I'm intending to stay long term i.e. 5-10 years so I would appreciate all the support I can get here.Kind Regards,Steve
