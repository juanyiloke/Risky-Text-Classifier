Where to buy cheap BS test strips ?Hello, everybody !It's been a while since last time I am online...I moved down to London from Scotland two years ago, after finding myself a new job in Romford. So far, everything seems to be OK here except one thing: two weeks ago, the number of my test strips was cut down from 200 to 100. This is because the practice, as a guidance, only gives 50 strips to diabetics on tablets and 100 to those on insulin like me. The GP has frankly told me it all comes down to the budget. Although the GP will book me an appointment with a diabetic nurse, but I have no delusions that it's going to change anything, except knowing I probably will be condescendingly told by the diabetic nurse that what I have been doing is wrong and there is no need to test even 3 times a day...I guess my only option, at the end of the day, is to buy the extra test strips myself. So, I'm just wondering where I can find some cheaper test strips ? I currently use aviva test strips which is about 21 pounds for a box of 50.Regards,Kelvin
