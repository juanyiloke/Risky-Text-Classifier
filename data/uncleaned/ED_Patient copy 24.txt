i think i have bulimiaHi all i've never posted on this group before, but I think i have bulimia. i got disagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a few months ago. ive always been obsessed with my weight, i weigh myself every day. i lost about 3 stone last year and was SO healthy, i was so tonned and ate really healthy foods, had a personal trainer, was 5'4 and just under 10 stone so i was quite healthy. im a 21 year old female and since ive had anxiety, i cant stop making myself sick. before it would be maybe once a week if i had a big meal and felt uncomftorble, but recently its 3 times a day, after every meal. i know how bad this is for my body, so why am i doing  it? why cant i stop ? i hate making myself sick, it hurts, and i feel weak after. but honestly i just cant stop no matter how hard i try? i havent told anyone about it because i am just so embarassed by it. i keep it all a secret. i literally stare at my body for hours and weigh myself every half an hour. why am i so obsessed with my weight? i want to get help, i really do, but cant talk to anyone about it. if i know that making myself sick is basically killing me, and i know its so unhealthy for me, why do i keep doing it? i really dont feel in control anymore, i dont know whats happening to me, can anyone relate or help? xxx
