Type 2s injecting insulin wanted for PhdFound details in Balance magazine wanting in particular females and ethnic minority injectors.Nami Minorikawa is working for her PHd doctorate and is interested in the information received before having to be put onto insulin and the support received during this process and immediately afterwards. She records the entire interview and also shows examples on her laptop and by print-outs (after hearing your story) of examples for being able to help people. This includes print-out from this forum and DiabetesUK forum and videos. She interviewed me at home at a time to suit and will travel anywhere in the Oxford/London area and southwards. Or will meet at a mutually convenient place if home is not an option. She pays £20 for the interview and mine lasted from 1pm til 4.45 - but this included one loo break, two drink breaks and one break to play with the dog! Very good at bringing you back to the point in the nicest possible way and asked if I could out a plea for more people for her to interview.Her email is namiminorikawa@phc.ox.ac.uk and she will send you full details.
