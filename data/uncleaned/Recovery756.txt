The positive effects of exercise. Why not take advantage of it?I was in the Police Force for 16 years before being medically discharged with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and acute depression and anxiety. I started seeing psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors and taking many medications but the one thing that helped me the most to come through a lot of the struggles I was having was physical activity every day. It let out a lot of the anger, raised my feel good endorphins and it wore me out at night so I could sleep. I started my own fitness business in December 2012 in the Wollongong area of NSW and run a session called "Walk and Talk" specifically aimed at people with depression and anxiety. I have the support of local doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists and support groups but I can not get anyone to come and try it. It is frustrating because I know how much better exercise can make you feel but I also know how hard it can be to leave your house and how deliberating depression and anxiety can be. Does anyone have any positive thoughts on how I can encourage people to come and take part? Just as I helped people for 16 years when I was a police officer I want to help people again but I don't know how.
