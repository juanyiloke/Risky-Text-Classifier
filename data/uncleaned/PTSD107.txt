I Hate Vacations And ReturningAll week I have been on vacation. Vacations, I have begun too figure out, are not very positive for me. I don't mean on vacation like going somewhere, but just a regular school vacation (I'm a teacher). So vacations for me mean more down time and more time with my family. I feel horrible saying it, but both of those are not very positive for me right now.My kids trigger me and though I have had some good interactions with them, mostly I have been avoiding them. And my husband is really supportive, but he can't help me and the kids and obviously the kids have to win in terms of who gets his attention.Vacation also means time to catch up on grading and planning and while I have done a fair amount of that, I could have done more.I had two therapy sessions and a session with an intuitive healer (my best yet with her, but still hard). My therapist left for her own traveling vacation on Friday. She will be gone two week.sToday I feel completely alone and abandoned. I feel like I will never be whole again. I felt the same way yesterday only I was able to force myself to participate in life a little more. Today, I went to church and that's about it. I have spent the rest of the day in bed- sleeping, working, or playing games. I tried to go downstairs to help with dinner and the kids, but though I got my youngest up from his nap and downstairs, I knew I couldn't stay. I was filled with that no-one-loves me feeling that just leads to a short fuse and switching personalities and that's not a good thing. I just wish I knew how to get past this.ÊI am hoping the structure of going back to work will help, but I don't want to return to work either. I just hate feeling this way and though perhaps if I shared it on here, someone might be able to make me feel a tiny bit better.
