Ê*****trigger warning***** oh god. it's realHaving a seriously bad day and am not coping. Have had a week of dissociating, flashbacks, nightmares and have even emailed my CPN about possibly taking meds which I've been against up to now. And my last couple of trauma therapy sessions have been really tough (although my therapist is excellent) and, since last week's session, I've been on the verge of one element of my traumas completely coming out. I've had flashbacks for the past few tears but One flashback hadn't made sense because I couldn't place myself there. And today, I dissociated and typed and typed on my laptop and my secrets about what happened many years ago come out and with them coming out, the biggest element came out. The one that links to that flashback. The one that makes the flashback finally make sense. The one that my dissociation had kept suppressed. And the thing that happened is bigger than me. It's bigger than all the parts of me put together. It's too big to deal with. And I'm hurting. I'm really hurting . Help me.
