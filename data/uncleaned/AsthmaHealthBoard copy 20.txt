Asthma dependence________________________________________Hi all!New to forums and was wondering, should I always use asthma medication as prescribed? Currently on a dose of one puff of 125mg Flixotide twice daily but don't feel like I need it that often. Local doctors are very busy at the moment (can't see me for at least 3 weeks!) and I feel that using Flixotide is unnecessary. Can I reduce the dosage temporarily (and safely) without doctor's advice? My asthma isn't bad or chronic and Flixotide is rather expensive for what it is and it feels like an unnecessary cost.
