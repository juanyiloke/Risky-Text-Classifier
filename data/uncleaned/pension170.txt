Innocent? pay costs anywayIf you are accused of committing a motoring offence when you are innocent and should you decide to take the matter to court where justice is done and you are declared innocent then it would not be unreasonable for you to expect to be able to reclaim any costs incurred by you relative to clearing your name. Which is as it is and as it should be. Until now. Any fair minded individual would be in agreement so I was at a loss to believe this article (link below) when I first read it. But then I realise that we are in a country run by New labour and Gordon Brown, he of the stealth tax.Ê Whilst this is primarily directed at motorists, yet again I feel it will be the thin edge of the wedge. How long before this practice would be carried over to more serious crimes, before in the event some extra revenue is required a spate of failed prosecutions becomes the normI urge you to read the article and if so minded to sign the petition the link to which is on the page
