Êis ignorance really bliss ?Hello everyone. I have met an old friend of mine yesterday and even though I was nervous to see him it helped, he understood what I was going through and was supportive. But he said one thing that I cannot fully agree and I want to know your opinion about it. So, he said that I must ignore my psychotic episodes and he also said that I should stop reading and looking things up about my illness as it makes me too conscious about myself and he also thinks that the reason I have been having multiple episodes recently is because I know too much about my illness and was thinking about it. So he said that I should stop looking things up about my illness and just ignore and let go. Is it true? is being ignorant about my illness is good or should I read more self help book ?
