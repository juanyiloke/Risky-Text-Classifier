i have have had PTSD for awhile now. its hard to think about things when all i can think about is if i will get hurt again or what is going to happen next. sometimes i feel helpless.. i have a hard time falling asleep. my mind wanders all the time. i try to do things that made me happy in the past but, it never works. it just makes me more depressed. i also have really bad anxiety attacks. i cant control them. i freak out sometimes i bust things becuase im upset or stressed about whats going on. most of the time i break down and start crying.
