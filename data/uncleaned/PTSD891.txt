Êshe blowsAnd the point of my existence is?Fuck it. All of it. Comparing me. No. I cannot take it. Its been building and building. I can hardly sit still for five fucking minutes. What is the point. I know i have to continue anyway but i basically died that day. I was already dead. Im just a shell with shit inside. Nothing much left. Cannot go away this weekend. Cannot even be with peopke. Go away. Door shut. I cannot keep going with this shit. Im exhausted. I never get a day off. Im an idiot. It was all my doing and they were right about me. They all think im a pathetic loser. There you go. I spout bollocks am i allowed to swear. Sorry. Fucked off. No strnger than that. Im gutted. Heartbroken and lost. I cant cope. On the edge. Im going to have to take a pill now and be dribbling tomorrow. Stop comparing me with others. Whay happened to me was wrong wrong wrong wrong. All of it. Wrong. Why. Why. Stop comparing me. Just because you cant see how i feel. You cant see my thoughts. Im always on the edge. Im exhausted. Every day. No telief for four years.
