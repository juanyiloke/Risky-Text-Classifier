What does lung cancer look like onachest x ray?After a dry cough for 3 months with some arm and shoulder pain with chest pains and coughing up some blood a few time I got a chest x ray and the doctor found a "patch" on my middle lobe. She said IRS could be an infection but with my other problems I think they are linked. She did say she wasn't worried about it but I'm not convinced. So what does it look like on an x ray? Would the doc be suspicious ? Or are they difficult to tell apartBeen having bowel problems also so i linked them together after some research and to me it looks like i have bad bowel cancer and now mets to the lungs from my research
