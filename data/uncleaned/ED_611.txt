Trying to make waves in getting better, wow what a failure!TWFor quite a while now I've been trying to make huge steps in getter better however my head has gone into overdrive. I am failing miserably and my head is in overdrive.I have tried to keep things on the straight and narrow, only problem is that my team are misinterpreting progress and where we should be going with things. I have now been left in a difficult situation which is fuelling my ED. I've upped my excersize and using diet coke as a crutch. I have always said that I would try but if I'm really honest I don't think I'm ever going to get really far with this as every time I see my ED team and get weighed, it sends me into a spin and I'm struggling to deal with it.On the plus side I'm trying eat more vegetables and looking at alternatives to carbs. Got my next appointment with all my care team incl my ed consultant on Wednesday.What should be a positive meeting about coming to a clear agreed plan to tackle my issues, I fear that my poker face way of dealing with things will be exposed. I cannot go on like this. It has to end.
