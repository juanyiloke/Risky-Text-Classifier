1-hour sample in OGTT   Though the WHO guidelines mention the 2-hr sample and the relevant levels for diagnosis of Diabetes, this can be somewhat misleading even for dcoctors. In my experience, the 1-hr sample is helpful in picking up an additional 10-15% of diabetic individuals who have a normal 2-hr blood glucose level. But many clinicians insist that they cannot use the 1-hr glucose level to diagnose diabetes, because the WHO guidelines only mention the 2-hr levels for diagnosis! This is like saying a dinosaur is not a dinosaur because it has come 63 million years late! If the 1-hr sample is abnormal, you may even the 2-hr sample , since the diagnostic information has already come in from the 1-hr sample!
