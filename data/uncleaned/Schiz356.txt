I am a single mom and we were living in low income apartment unit for about 6 years, and then I saw this ad for home ownership for first time buyers. I got the loan through USDA rural development, since I also had a great job at the time, and good credit.the nice thing is, the mortgage payments are based upon my income, so once a year I submit all of our income, and they tell me what I will pay that year. Right now I'm paying $632 a month for a 3bd, 2 bath, 2 car garage split foyer home in a cul-de-sac with other nice houses.The majority of this payment is my eskrow, because I live by a school, and my taxes are insane, like 2K a year, and insurance is another $900 per year.When we moved in, my kids were about 11 years old, and they immediately did better in everything. I also was able in the first 2 months here to get a city grant to improve the house, and got new siding, heater, windows, doors, etc. That did not cost me a cent.I am very thankful, having my disability and my kids disabilities to be out of apartments. Thank God! And I love it here.
