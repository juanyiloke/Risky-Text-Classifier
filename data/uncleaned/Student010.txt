Going to ex poly..by lookitsellieI had a lot of trouble with my AS levels, and I purposely picked A levels that sounded more academic to look good on uni applications, which I now regret. I messed up my AS grades after an up and down year (diagnosed with anxiety and constant panic attacks), and basically stopped caring about my grades. I came out with BCDD. I dropped one of the D grades (physcology) and I'm resitting the other (German). My second year has been a lot better and so far I'm on track to improve my grades. However, my poor results from last year limited where I could apply for uni and I have a firmed an ex-poly. I really like the course (English Literature) and the uni itself, but I sometimes hate myself for kind of giving up in Year 12. I was so enthusiastic about uni before sixth form, I had ideas of where to go already. I considered taking a year out but I really, really don't want to as the school I go to is basically what caused my anxiety in the first place. I have always overachieved at school prior to sixth form and received good GCSEs, so I feel like going to this uni is not a valid 'culmination' of my school years. I know the obvious option is to resit but I do like this course. It has low entry requirements and that's not what I'm aiming for this year. I've sorted my accommodation and I am excited but when I hear of people who I am just as capable as going to more respected unis, I start to feel a bit worried. Will my decision to go to an ex poly hinder me at all in the future, and will my uni experience still be a positive one?Sorry for the ramble ?
