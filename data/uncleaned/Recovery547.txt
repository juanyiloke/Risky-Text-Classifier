  I weep for my former selfim reading my blog from 2010 on thiswebsite .Ashesaway.That was my name.My life was a hell I cant explain.But there is a God and He saved me.This website helped me and the people here tried to help me every day and night.Ultimately I sought medical help and met the man I love,and now live in a dream come true on an island doing things I always dreamed I would.The power of human compassion and God saved me.This website kept me alive.To all of you suffering..there is a light right around the corner..just take the hands that reach for you...wether it be doctors,parents,guidance councelors,friends or strangers..you will never be alone.There is help
