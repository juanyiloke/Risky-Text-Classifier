T is now worried...It was a typical session, one of which I just act like everything's going great and that I'm fine. I usually fill up the time with small talk so that by the time she asks me about my SUI thoughts, we don't have enough time to dive into it. Well, the last few weeks it has increased from a 4 to a 7. Actually it's been around a 9 for a couple of months, but I've been scared to tell her. Bringing it up slowly has kind of kept T off my back, but she said she was getting worried about it now. I don't know what to do, but thankfully I don't see her until the 21st. At the moment they are just thoughts, but I have created another plan and did quite a lot of research. No date set, and no major intent, maybe a 3 out of 10. Anyway, it bothers me that she I worried... Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.__________________Don't let life get you down.

Free to fly away...But that day seems so far away...I just don't want to keep trying anymore.I can't tell anyone IRL either, as everyone thinks I am doing great.But I am drowning and my lungs are filled with water...__________________Don't let life get you down.

You don't have a choiceI can't be truthful in real life anymore. I feel like everyone is watching me and I feel like I have to perform perfectly. So far, as long as I smile, no one knows. No one knows that the nightly nightmares are back, that my thoughts are over powering my instincts to live, that my skin on my arms are itchy. No one knows because they will take away my freedom, my choice. They will do what *they* see is best, and lock me away.What if I don't want help anymore? Oh wait, I'm crazy, so I don't know what I want, only they do.
