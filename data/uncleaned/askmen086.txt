Two different philosophies2012-11-24, 12:01 PMI was trained by 2 different people 1st person told me to never befriend my employees and that I have to push them. and that I am their boss they are here to work and listen to me. If we start socializing no work is going to get done, this seems to work but I was also told it might bite me back in the @zz. This seems to work but then the picture of me is: weirdo, doesn't talk much, serious about his job.2nd person told me to friend my employees, act like i care and play dumb, find out more about them treat them like they are really important to you, ask them questions and so on. But every time I talk to them they ask me questions about my self as well and I don't know if I should answer or not, I mean I dont want to be their friend, I just want them to get the job done. Some of the questions they ask are real personal like my age, I am younger than all my employees and they also asked how long I worked for the company, almost all of them been there over a year I been working here 2 months and already got promoted and I never answered that question because I did not want to discourage anyone.what should I do? I want to gain respect and get the job done at the same time,Hell is the Impossibility of reason
