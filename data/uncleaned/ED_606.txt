Seeking advice for EDMy story is a long one! I'm 37, and suffered from AN/BN for over 20 years with severity of illness varying. Held down a job for 10 years (God knows how!) but a few years ago, I had major relapse resulting in me being referred to ED unit by GP. Anyway... I discharged myself because I was too afraid to commit to change. Now, a year on, I'm physically better (healthy BMI) but I feel awful. Depressed, anxious and chaotic eating habits! I really want to sort this out for good because I can't go on like this anymore but I know I couldn't cope with ed service again. It makes me feel like I'm wasting their time and others deserve help more than me. (Bit of cliché- sorry but genuinely feel that way). Suggestions gratefully received! Thank you if you got to the end of all that!
