I think they should reform the euthanasia laws. I needs it, i qualifies in every single way, my euthanasia would harm none. So whats the big deal? My problem is worse than terminal, it's life long and painful, drugs pain poverty drugs pain pain from drugs more pain poverty, id honestly rather have been terminal in some way. They say you are so mad you can't choose it, you can sure get your blank to work though and make them some more money, you are sane enough for that. You can go walk the streets to sometimes, sane enough for that. Whats really crazy though, i've already made the drug companies their money and the scientists already got their research, still won't allow it though huh? No point whatsoever to deny me much needed euthanasia, much needed, id like to stress that word there, needed. Just no point at all. So stupid, they'd give me choices during psychosis, wtblank? You only get to make the choices though if they want you to, now im on medication and doing just fine mentally but in much pain. Can't choose that though. During psychosis you give me choices?! Ahh blank it! Little mutated apes, apes with brains, they do it just like the apes in everyway just with more brain.
