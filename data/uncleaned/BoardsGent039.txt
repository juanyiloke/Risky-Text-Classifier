pressure and gender stereotypesgrowing up, or even now, do you feel pressure to conform to the ideal image of what a man or a 'lad' should be? strong emotionally, physically,confident, interest in sport, drinking with the lads, banter etc. nowadays do you think it's harder for men who are quiet, bookish, sensitive or introverted to thrive in society, particularly in Ireland? as a culture are we accepting of all types of men?
