Treat me kind, treat me mild, I'll be out in a little whileI may be done, certainly something someone has said before. Cannot say for sure, I may be losing, and it is not okay, but I am tired and foolish and at one point angry, but even anger has been defeated by my depression. My depression, yes, it is mine, only mine, and no one seems to want to share it with me, or maybe I don't want to share it with anyone.ÊI am losing, bad, and there is so much that I can do. But that is the problem. I am not allowed to, the almighty D does not want me to. I will ask, though, not for a cure, but for a hug in which there will be no damn words. Only a hug, a long one--and please have me cry, please make me cry on your shoulder and as we part, clear my tears with your hand.
