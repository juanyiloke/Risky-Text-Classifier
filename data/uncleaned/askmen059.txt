How would you determine a consultant fee?2013-05-31, 06:07 PMBecause I occasionally do some public speaking, I am sometimes offered work as a consultant. Usually, this is a one-time deal or something short-term, but two offers are coming down the pike that would engage me more regularly. Because of the way that they're related, I'm starting to fantasize that, eventually, I could make a living strictly on consultant work alone and quit my regular job (not because I don't enjoy it, but because I would love to have even more flexibility than I have now, and I prefer short term projects vs. projects that will take two or three years to come to fruition).So, I need to tell them my hourly rate. Consultants usually make more per hour than their salaried counterparts, but how much is too much? Most of the work I've been doing is for projects where everyone involved is cutting their regular fees because they believe in the work and want to see the project continue far past the grants that currently fund them. However, the people who want to engage me now have much better funding and can afford to pay full rates.Have any of you done consulting work? How did you determine your fee?Ê(There is no one else that I know of doing similar work in my city.)
