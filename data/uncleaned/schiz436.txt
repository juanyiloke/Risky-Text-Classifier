ÊfreedomI stopped taking my meds and my head feels more free my thoughts comes to me like the universe is talking to me like everything around me it talking. They give me all these pills just to keep my mind in prison to hold it back. but now i can think the voices are free and my mind is going a hundred miles a hour. of course i have paranoia doctors giving me all these meds but now everything talks to me. who gives a crap about meds
