Given bad advice at nurse appointment this morning[Note to anyone reading this, especially if new: I am a T2 of 15 years' standing, and I suspect that my insulin resistance may be particularly severe. The numbers in this post reflect that. They may not be applicable to other T2s, and certainly are not applicable to a T1.]I went to a nurse appointment this morning, and it went fairly well, but I don't think the nurse I saw was a DSN (the surgery DSN is on leave). She seemed to reckon that because I am on insulin I "must be" a T1, because she complained about my treating one high with a 10 unit increase over my standard reference dose (of 40 units), saying that "the safe increase is between 2 and 5 units"!   For a T1, maybe, but I doubt that a 2u increase (5%) would have any noticeable effect on me, and even 5u would hardly do anything. Plus, if she was right, why didn't the 70u dose (30u above the baseline) I used to correct a particularly bad high result in a massive hypo?(And, in switching my insulin to Novomix 30 from Insulatard, for some unfathomable reason they've reduced the repeat from 10 vials to 5. As I've pointed out in requesting another 5, a single vial lasts me about 3-4days, so I've asked them to put the repeat back up to 10, otherwise I will have to be putting in a repeat every week or so.)
