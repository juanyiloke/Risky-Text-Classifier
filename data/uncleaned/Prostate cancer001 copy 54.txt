I was diagnosed with prostate cancer I m 54 years old. From 2008 I was performed 3 biopsis all of them negative for cancer but with ASAP and high grade PIN. My psa screening was elevated all this time . Last January it was 21,57 n/grms. I was performed a new biopsis with 25 cores. They found 2 of them with adenocarcinoma 3+3 =6 score in Gleanson score. On the left lobe they found one core  very suspicious for adenocarcinoma.I was recomended to be treated . I m not sure what therapetic procedure to follow: Brachytherapy or robotic radical prostatectomy. I m interesting in keeping my sexual function and bladder good function.Tks
