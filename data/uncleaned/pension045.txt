Surgery ClinicsI am diabetic and therefore should have a regular yearly check-up but being disabled and usually in a great deal of pain in the mornings I do not make appointments for before 1pm. My surgery however, only has morning Db clinics..I explained the situation to the nurses in charge and am met with a very strict rebuff and absolutely NO afternoons entertained.On a couple of occasions I have written to the practice manager who made an arrangement for me to be seen but much to the chagrin of the nurses involved!I wonder how many have to put up with this sort of attitude after all there must be lots of people who for various reasons cannot make morning appointments.Letter number 3 now on it's way..
