Scared To Ask For Help??Hi everyone,I'm wondering if anyone else feels scared to seek help about their depression? I've been feeling pretty awful for a while now and some days I'm sure I am getting worse. I know the go to advise is to seek help from a GP but I'm scared to go because I'm scared of what they will say.I guess the problem is that I'm worried they will diagnose me with depression, because once I'm diagnosed it will be a real thing and I have to handle it, it's not just my secret that I can hide away until I'm alone in my room or crying in the shower, and then pretend isn't happening tomorrow when the sun comes up. I'm so worried about what might happen if ÊGP decides I have depression; I don't what to be medicated and even though I am dying to talk to someone about what is going on in my head, no amount of talking is going to fix all the things I'm sad about.ÊAnd then there's the flip side of it. Maybe I won't be diagnosed with anything, and if I don't have anything then why am I the way I am? Some days I'm losing my mind and I'm certain there's something wrong with me, and other days I feel less crazy and I wonder if I'm just hormonal or tired and too lazy to deal with my problems. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way, and I feel guilty writing it now, because it's like I'm hoping I have a mental illness.. and that's not right, is it?I guess what I'm saying is I'm scared to have it confirmed either way. But I'm also scared of where I might end up if I don't get help. I don't know what to do!ÊÊI'm really wanting to know if anyone can relate to how I feel and if so, what did you do/are you doing?
