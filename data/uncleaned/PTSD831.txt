ÊMedical PTSDI am seeing an eye surgeon this morning. I'm having a lot of anxiety about it. I think I have PTSD from several surgeries as a child immediately after my dad's suicide. Not only was I emotionally traumatized already but my mother was very histrionic and before each surgery she would sob and tell me she was afraid I wouldn't survive each surgery. This terrified me. I was only seven so I believed her hysteria and it made the surgeries so much harder. That child in me still feels so scared when I've had surgery as an adult. Now I'm facing it again and I feel very anxious.
