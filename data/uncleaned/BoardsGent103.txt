ProstatectomyI am considering a prostatectomy as a preferred method of dealing with cancer in my prostate. It is my understanding that the most important thing to know is who is doing the surgery and do they have a good batting average. Has anyone here had a prostatectomy? And who did your surgery? Were you happy with the results? Were the nerves that allow you to have an erection preserved? Finally, has anyone had any experience of <modsnip>? All of the testimony on the US Cancer Forum seems to suggest that those who proactively sought out the best surgeon were happiest with the results. Any feedback welcomed.
