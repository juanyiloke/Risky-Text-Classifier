Today has been a blurrrr¥	Hey ladies hope you all doing ok¥	Well today has been a mixture of emotions I had my 5th tax last Friday had the lowered dose as suffering from bad se I made an appointment with my gp because I've not been sleeping very well and thought he might be able to give me something to help me sleep. I was in with him for half an hour he I just crumbled in there I don't even know why I ended up pouring my heart out to him so not only have I come away with something to help me sleep but an antidepressant which I'm not convinced I need to take. It's like a time bomb has gone off and I can't stop crying I'm sure I'm not alone here I thought I was doing well. It's a bitch all this we have to go through so much xx
