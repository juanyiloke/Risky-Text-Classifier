really BAD weakness! Whats wrong with me? :(  3  I'm a 21 year old female who is about 5"3, slim and about 110-115 pounds. I am healthy; I eat pretty healthy, exercise, don't drink alcohol, don't do drugs or don't smoke. Recently, I've been experiencing weakness and it's now getting to a point where I think something needs to be done.A little medical history about me: I have a severe chronic sleep condition and I was diagnosed half a year ago. I was prescribed medication then suffered an adverse reaction to it so I went off of it, all medications related to it and even some over the counter medications. I'm also allergic to dogs, cats, ragweed, etc. and am receiving allergy shots and I'm also severely lactose intolerant so I'm off all dairy products. The sleep disorder I've had for years but everything else started and began about 2 yrs ago.Okay so recently, I've been having weakness in my arms. I've always had this but thought I was normal but now I'm starting to think it's not. For example, I will eat breakfast (usually eggs and toast and a cup of coffee) and about 1.5 hrs later, I will feel weak. Sometimes it's hunger, but majority of the time, it's weakness and it's ONLY in the arms and sometimes I'll be too weak to stand up and will have to sit down. It's at this point in time where I need to grab something to eat.I even changed up my diet to a more healthy one. For snacks I'll have high fiber foods like apples, brocolli, nuts and I'll make sure I eat a well balanced lunch too. I don't eat a lot of sugar too. Overall, I eat pretty healthy.Has anyone had any experience with this? I've had blood tests done in the past but they all came back normal. Maybe I should get another one done? Could it be diabetes? As far as I'm concerned, only one person in my family has diabetes and that's because of his diet. (my uncle)Please help! thank you so much
