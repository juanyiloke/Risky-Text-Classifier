Newly diagnosed________________________________________Hello everyone! I was recently diagnosed with asthma. The Pulmonologist basically said I have hyper-sensitive airways, that my tests were within normal except for the methacholine challenge test which my function went down by 50% after initial (lowest) dose. Is this that bad? He then handed me a presciption for ProAir (allbutoral) inhaler. While I do notice some symptoms ie. tightness in the chest, or coughing during excercising, that is about it. Do I only use the inhaler when I have these symptoms? Dr. never gave me a chance to ask any questions as he went straight in to the results of my sleep study test. Gave me that paperwork, and was up and out. While the internet has been very helpful, I still have so many questions. Thank you!
