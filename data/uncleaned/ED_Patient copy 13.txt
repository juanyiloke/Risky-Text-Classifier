My brother doesn't eat anythingHello,I have a problem with my brother. He doesn't eat nothing. He wants to, but he doesn't like anything except french fries, meat and cakes. When he was a child, he used to have a very balanced diet but now, he is impossible! It's really bad for his health but there is nothing to do: he just doesn't want to eat a vegetable or a fruit, rice, fish or even pasta! As he can't eat always french fries and meat, he eats hardly nothing.Do you think that seeing a nutritionist would help him?
