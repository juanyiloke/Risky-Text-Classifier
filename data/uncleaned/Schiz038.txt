Living with a schizophrenicby BillyF » Wed Apr 01, 2015 10:43 amI have a sister with schizophrenia. Our family has been suffering with her. Since she turned 18, her first symptoms were aggressiveness, not able to sleep, stay like statue, talk illogically,etc. It has been a nightmare to our family. Her doctor gave her medication with which she is able to do her personal needs. When she skips the meds, the schizo attacks come back. Her college mates and professor treats her with indifference and this doesn't help her social skill at all.She has constant mood swing even with medication. We found out that the food plays a key role for brain reaction on to mood swing.Processed food, can food are definitely big NO. Food with preservative make her whole body itchy with red lumps.Has diet restriction helped other schizophrenia patients? Billy
