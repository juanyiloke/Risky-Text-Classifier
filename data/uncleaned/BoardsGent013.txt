Lewis Hamilton accused of "sexism"...This one might take the cake: Lewis Hamilton was accused of "sexism" and "discrimination" for...spraying one of the podium girls with champagne in Shangai. Apparently, the accusations come from some Roz Hardie from a group called "Object".I can't even begin to explain how much of an idiotic stance that one is; Way to shoot yourself in the foot for any supporter of the feminist cause.ÊEssentially anybody who gets on or nearby the podium after a motor race, be it F1, GP2, MotoGP, Nascar or whatever, knows he/she is fair game when the champagne comes out. There were quite a few dignitaries, leaders of governments, ministries and presidents drenched over the years. At least once, Prince Ranieri of Monaco himself was sprayed...by none other than Ayrton Senna.ÊIf they all had the mindset of the accusing lady, they should have all declared war to whatever country the culprit driver came from!Anyway, we're past the ridiculous marker here. It seems that we came to a point that any action, no matter what its meaning or intent, directed towards a woman is an act of sexism and discrimination, regardless of it being an actual offence or something like a compliment.ÊI seriously wonder if there will ever be a line drawn, maybe even at a legal level. Some of these "association" don't look like they're pursuing equality (towards which there still is some way to go, even 'though it's not in the traditional sense), rather seem hell bent into stigmatizing and condemning men as a whole.
