  I think I'm falling into depression, but I'm not sure...  johnnyboy, 1 Week AgoIm 19 years old, and I'm in my first year of college. Ive just felt so bad lately, and i don't know why. Im in a relationship with a girl and she causes me some stress, and I've been thinking of breaking it off, but I feel like i still love her, but um not sure. School is really hitting me hard, i just want to drop out. Ive been gambling money in hopes to strike it rich so i can leave college. I don't know what i want to pursue in life (career wise) and its killing me because i feel like I'm running out of time. I have NO hobbies accept watching TV, and i dont hang out with my friends often. its just this terrible feeling, but i don't know how to explain it. the only thing i do is go to school, homework, errands, and sit on my computer, looking for ways to feel better. Is this depression? How do i stop this feeling?
