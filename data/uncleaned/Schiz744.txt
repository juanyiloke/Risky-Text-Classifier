Êultimate theory threadok heres my theory. How we hear sounds from talking to sound is via the ear mechanism. That works by hair, membranes that turn vibrations into chemical/electro signals and the brain turns into sensation/interpretation via memory. So us hearing voices has to be connected to both the ears and the hearing mechanism of the brain. But why is it only myself that hears it?Êattenuation!the signal is converted directly to the inner brain, and through the ear mechanism. Let the idiots in health care lie all they want and hide the monsters who manipulate us all by this social/mind control.ÊYou can fight this problem using a three or four tiered system.medication/supplementsblocking fabrics/weavesblocking chemicals like coal tar soap and wax.sea salt on window cillsimagine sounds, signals and such to block the voices directly at the entrance site.try this, tell others if you find something that works. Dont let these bullies and liars program your reality!
