Complete fixation(*graphic)I've only posted here a few times and i just feel like i need to get it out. Sorry if its completely wrong of me.My eating disorder has got to its most serious point of all time. I've been struggling with this for so long, it doesn't matter anymore.I'm completely fixated on what food does to me, what it can do, i read every label and most of the time i just look at the food and it makes me want to be sick everytime. If i do eat it then i'm in the bathroom until i pass out.My husband knows about it, but not the severity of it. He has even made jokes and that sends me into a whirlwind.I look at people all the time and think why can't i be like that, look like that, to the point of where my stress levels are so high, i can't even think.All my family have great bodies and then there is me, this enormous looking creature. I just don't understand anymore.I just think f**k all of this. I'm miserable, i'm brusing all the time and my husband gets thoughts of the worst. I'm at a dead end and i just can't keep going on. I just think why did this happen to me, will it ever end? Maybe not, maybe i'll just be like this all the time. It's just the norm.Sorry for rambling.B
