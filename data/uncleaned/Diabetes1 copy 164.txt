My hands!!!Hi everyone, not been on here for sometime, but would like to ask a few questions re Diabetic Neuropathy.I have been treated for Inflammatory Arthritis for the last 12 months or so, going through the DMARDs, Methotrexate, Sulphsalazine to which I could not tolerate, now taking Hydroxycloraquine. I saw my Rheumy on Thursday and he says it's not inflammatory arthrits, but thinks it is due to diabetic Neuropathy and/or my Fibromyalgia. My palms are very red and hot almost all the time. I have swelling in my fingers, my middle fingers being worse, also a lot of pain and stiffness, to the extent that on occasions I can't bend the middle fingers at all.I am intolerable to strong pain meds and only take paracetamol and Pregabalin. I am asthmatic so cannot take NSAIDs, I have sarcoidosis in both lungs and take prednisolone for this, I have high blood pressure and cholesterol, type 2 diabetes for which I have just changed to gliclizide from metformin due to very bad diarrhea for a long time.I was just wondering if there is anything that could help with this, I am at my wits end as to what to expect now, will be seeing my GP on Monday for his outlook on this situation.JanWhy
