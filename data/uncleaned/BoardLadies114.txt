Irish women and SymphysiotomyShocking report on women who were given no option other than to endure such a horrific procedure as symphiosity just now on Vincent Browne.Apparently, it was considered by some very catholic doctors as a means of limiting women viewing caesarian sections as a "birth control" method. As in, you can usually only have 3-4 caesarian sections in a lifetime.Horrendous stories of what many women were forced to endure in this country, without proper information, their consent and with horrible lifelong health reprecussions like incontinence, not to mention 5 weeks in hospital one woman spoke about, with her split pelvis.ÊAll due to religious determination over a woman's health.ÊThese women have been forced to endure the most unbelievable hell, and they are still fighting to get recognition for it.
