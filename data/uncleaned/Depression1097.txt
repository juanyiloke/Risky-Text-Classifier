stuck with ithey. So I post here now and again and read people's stories. I have a wife and I don't like sharing things. Like depression and bad stuff that used to happen to me. So I talk to people online about it and it makes me feel better. The problem is she's insecure. So when I talk to people about it I do it discretely. I don't want to bring it up with her and I don't want her to know about my old life. I tell people I can't remember anything from before I was 16. Anyhow she caught me taking to someone and immediately went ballistic. She doesn't like me talking to people online. up till 2 am getting blasted Because I won't share anything with her or take about it.  The thing is I don't want to talk about it. I just want anon people to listen and not judge so I can keep living normally. I don't want anything in my past to get dragged up ever. And I don't want to share.  I guess I'm just venting but how do you convey to someone there's a part of you they will never know and you'll never share it with them. Without them feeling rejected. Especially when shes your wife.  How do you explain to them how depressed you get and it's natural. They've had a perfect life. No medical issues. No abuse. No trauma. Like someone with PTSD I get angry at her when she wants to talk and I really don't want to. How would a soldier talking about what he did in the war and the things he's seen and had done to him help... it wouldn't. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I want to be normal but I'm being forced. It doesn't help that she's insecure and thinks I cheat on her even though I tell her I don't I just talk to people.  And I don't want to tell her about how I talk to people and talk on forums because I don't want her reading the things I type mainly to protect her from myself Because I'm afraid she might leave me if she found out. I feel so ashamed I can't just be normal.
