What do you do to improve yourself?I guess that's a rather broad question but it is something that I have been thinking about quite a bit in recent months.ÊTaking care of ones health and well being is not a strong point in men, or is it? Based on my brief observations, there seems to be endless products, services and avenues that women can consider to improve themselves should they require it. Is it as disproportionate as I think it is?I'm in my early 30's now and I am starting to think about eating better and exercising. Both of which I am guilty of neglecting. However, aside from a physical well being I am curious as to how men actively take care of their mental well being. We all know that far too many men don't take care of their mental health and has lead to awful consequences. The stats in this country is horrifying.From my own perspective, I'm trying to get back into reading as I believe reading is for the mind as the gym is to the body. However, this has been a bit of a struggle as I find my concentration levels are not as good as they were with regards to reading novels.ÊFor those of you out there who are more conscious of your well being than others, what approach to life and/or activities etc do you do that you believe has helped you?I'm posting this here as it particularly something I am interested from a males perspective but female comment is welcome.
