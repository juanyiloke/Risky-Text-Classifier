noncalcified lung nodule 5mm helpI am a 44 to nonsmoker. My mother, who smoked for years, died from stage 4 sclc. I have been exposed to 2nd had smoke all my life. My dad still smokes about 2 packs a day. I am concerned because I just found out that I have a 5 mm noncalcified lung nodule in the lower right lobe of my lungs. I know this is small but I am still concerned. Has anyone else had this diagnosis. I have also developed a bad cough over the last month. Thank you, I won't be going to meet with Dr until 4-4-14 so I am concerned.
