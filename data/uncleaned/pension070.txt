Housing benefitHello all,First visit to P/Forum! I was wondering if any member is up on Housing Benefit claims. The reason being I have retired and my husband who is 62 has been seeking employment (no chance these days!) and has been receiving a 'top up housing benefit allowance' he has a small income from a works pension which we can just about survive on, however he is finding the fortnightly arduous visits to the Jobcentre to much. Is there a way to claim HB allowance without registering at Jobseekers every time? We are not in the financial position to retire completely on his Pension, so this H/benefit is needed for us to get by. He has also fully paid up N.I. contributions - 45 years.  Many thanks.
