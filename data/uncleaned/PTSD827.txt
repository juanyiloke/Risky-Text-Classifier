ÊTriggered by friend's near suicideToday I am a mess after helping my suicidal friend.it has brought up all these feelings of remorse that I could not save my father from killing himself. I have been crying all morning and feeling an irrational guilt. How could a 7 year old save a grown man? I know it makes no sense but part of me has always dreamed I could have been there, to wrap my arms around him and tell him I love you. Please don't leave me. He was so alone and so deeply depressed. The only note he wrote was, "cremation preferred". His parents buried him in the clothes he died in and gave him no headstone. I visited his grave when I was 15 but the cemetery didn't know exactly where he was. We ended up kneeling on the grass hoping we were near him. I have dreamed of giving him headstone for years but it may never be possible. I miss all the things we could have shared had he lived. Too much sorrow for me and strangely triggers me to feel suicidal myself. Just rough right now.
