 Do you always expect the worst to occur when things are stable?Yeah I'm not even going to deny the fact that I do.It's not even that I'm necessarily always a negative person per say all the time (haha - open to interpretation) - but honestly?The pattern of events in my life 100% persistently and always with out fail have proved this:The moment I get into some sort of "comfort zone" - wham - somebody rips the rug from beneath my feet and then I'm left standing back at square one.Does this even make sense?I get very very wary of when I think I may be "getting somewhere" with my life.Because it just always seems to back peddle itself and then I have to start all over again.I hope I'm not the only one who thinks this.Don't get me wrong.I mean I'm working on things; again; I'll get there for sure; it's just I am tired of running in circles and having to start from the bottom just to crawl to the middle ground again. Woah I'm not even talking about reaching the top. Just middle ground.
