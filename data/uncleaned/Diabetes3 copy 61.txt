Feeling sick on metforminI was recently diagnosed with type2 and was prescribed metformin. I am now on 2 500g in the morning, one at dinner time and one in the evening, it has reduced my blood sugar levels to on average 8.5/9.0 and my gp said this is OK, but I don't think this is low enough, any advice.Second point is, the medication has left me with a very dry mouth and horrible taste and a really sick feeling, is this normal and will it pass or should I ask to change my medication. GP not concerned, but really getting to me.Third question, my eye sight is totally screwed up. I can now see a good distance out of one eye, despite the fact I wear glasses because I am short sighted. I now can't read books etc without borrowing my wife's reading glasses. My GP said I should go and get new glasses, but I am concerned that my blood sugars are still not low enough and have settled in just 3 weeks, has anyone experienced this.I don't know if I am alone, hopefully not, this last 3 weeks has been a very frightening timeTony
