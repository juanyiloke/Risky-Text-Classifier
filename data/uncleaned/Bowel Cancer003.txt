Look good,feel better sessionsEarly on in my treatment, a friend of mine who is also going through cancer told me about "Look good,feel better".I had never heard of it, so I had a search around and read up about it..In the UK, (sorry to any ladies over the water, I'm sure there will be something similar available) there are sessions run at most cancer centres, I'll post the link to the website at the end of my ramble  They are sessions run by women for women with ANY type of cancer.

They have cleanse and tone/moisturise stuff as well as full size makeup, all proper high end brands ( I had Lancome, Estee Lauder, Liz Earle and No7 in mine) and you get to keep this lovely bag of goodies.I had a really lovely afternoon, tea and biscuits with women who were so funny and it was great to get to know them .You already have a bond, I guess.I really felt boosted afterward and thought it would be a shame if the ladies on here missed out simply because it's something not widely known about.I believe there are similar sessions run for teenagers and men by the same organisation but that would need looking into should anyone in those groups wish to  The link is www.lookgoodfeelbetter.co.uk/I hope this is useful, as I found it gave me something to look forward to ad on the day I was so glad I attended. Just be aware that the sessions are popular so you may have a 6-8 week wait They're absolutely free too.
