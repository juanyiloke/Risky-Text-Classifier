Re :- ''sad news''OK  , OK , you got me you lot , read all the lovely things you had to say  ( though I suspect you're all a bit barmy ! ) and I was amazed , ,didn't know I had made so many friends on here  ,  never realised that my little contributions were so well received ........you've really left me feeling embarrased !.........So , ..old grumpy-bum's back on board !Must get this off my chest.................I could not possibly explain what upset me in a way that other people could understand ..it was a singularly personal  ''quirk '' in my nature ....just one of those things that makes me see red .......this problem has got me into trouble a few times in the past  ,but I just accept it !.......I am neither proud nor apologetic of it .Hugh , I note your change of the matter  , and your  apology ...thankyou !well , I guess I'll just have to sit back and see what sort of reception I get now I have cooled down and plucked up the courage to get back in here  TTFN
