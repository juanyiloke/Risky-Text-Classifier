I'm 27 and I just don't want to live. I still live with my parents and they treat me like a puppy. Even if they respected me and I lived on my own, I don't want to be a social person who has a job and friends and travels and lives the life everyone wants. I don't see the value in money. I don't see the value in romantic and physical relationships. Instant gratification doesn't hold much value to me either so sex and drugs don't mean anything to me either. I'm taking Ativan and seeing a therapist and my views still haven't changed. I don't want to grow old either. It's just a whole bunch of ailments and putting responsibility on someone else for my care. I've lived and experienced all that was meant for me, now it's my time to leave this world. I just want to find a painless way to do it. Can someone help me please?
