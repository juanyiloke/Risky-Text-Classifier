Additional probs/symptomsHello everyone! Im new here and it is my husband that has t2 diabetes. He was diagnosed 3.5 years ago. He started on insulin as all his levels were sky high. He has since been graduated down to 3mg glimeperide and 2000 metformin daily. Here's the other issues that I wondered if anyone else experienced that are related to the diabetes. He has hypertension the cause is currently being investigated. Heart liver and kidneys being checked via variety of ways. He has on occasion had excruciating chest pains that last afew mins. He has constantly cold feet. He doesn't sleep well and is tired all the time. His bloods are quite steady so thats fine. Hes very grumpy not normal for him. can anyone relate?
