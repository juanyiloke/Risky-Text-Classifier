Should I stick it out or start looking?2014-11-05, 10:57 PMI am an Accountant based in Canada, and have 3 years experience. Currently I am a Staff Accountant/Bookkeeper for a small accounting firm studying for my designation which I will have next year.I was laid off in January due to corporate restructuring. Long story short I was a Project Accountant on contract, new Controller came in and cleaned house by letting everyone in the department go. Ended up taking some part-time work to pay the bills and make ends meet kind of deal. Two months ago I took the job I am in now full-time, making ~40k/year, which is about an 8k pay-cut from the Project Accounting gig I had.ÊNeedless to say I inherited a mess from the previous worker who didn't know what he was doing...so I knew I was in for it when I started. They said that they were looking to promote me quickly, make me a full Accountant, and start taking on client files. I already feel bored now in my job because I don't feel challenged. All I have really done is data entry and reviewing financial packages. I have been asking co-workers for any extra work or cost analysis stuff and nothing has come my way. I have been told things will change in the new year when it gets really busy. I don't want to leave so soon, and I need the hours for my designation which finishes in May/June, but I feel like a step behind my class peers in my current role and it's only going to grow when they get their designation.The silver lining though is that there has been no discussion on them paying for the rest of my designation fees (about 5k). Would you jump ship automatically if they said no to paying for your deignation?What are your thoguths? Should I tough it out or jump ship?
