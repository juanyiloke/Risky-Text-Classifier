ÊEDNOSI've lost weight!ÊBut i dont think its enough. I'm more comfortable when I'm underweight -and im not.Stopped the daily weigh in. Diminished my daily food intake. (I have a fruit bar and a sandwich a day) on occasion i am full.ÊI dont calculate/measure everytging i consume anymore and i dont binge.My mom thinks i have dysmorphia. I dont think im a fatass anymore but i wouldnt go as far as saying im skinny. I dont want to be average. Ugh. Whats special about average? I want ppl to look at me and wonder wether i even eat.I think I'm okay with ednos for now..
