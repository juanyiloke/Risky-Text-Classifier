perception of voicesby rawdata » Sat Feb 28, 2015 7:53 pmsome backstory..Before my diagnosis i had been for about a few months hearing faint sounds of voices (possibly from neighbors), every once in awile here and there in my apartment, i was curious what this was and decided to record it, hearing nothing on my headphones on the recording, i increased the recorded volume many times greater than it was recorded at to a point where there was just loud static, and tried various forms of static removal to try and find some voices, after 5-8hrs of this i finally found some voices on my recordings, i listened to them talking this way for a few days but then i started to hear the voices more loudly without any aid in my apartment, to the point of them drowning out anything else and me talking with them, i didn't realize how far i had gone, i thought it was all real, after my breakdown and getting some help i felt like i was voice free for about 6 months, untill i got curious about these voices again and started to record them every once in awile just to hear everything they were saying and be sure that what i was recording was the truth, this went on for a few months till i decided i had heard enough of them and stopped listening to this "static" alltogetherto me i wonder, did i change the way i perceive sounds due to listening to very loud static for days (and then again later on) in such a way that now when i hear a certain background noise i interpret it as a voice or voices, with or without medication (maybe less with medication), i can usually still hear some voices in my apartment, yet when i leave the house i don't have any problems at all (apart from slightly above normal paranoia), i don't have any voices when i'm outside or anywhere else other than in my apartment, i have been on vacation for weeks without any meds and i have no problem at all, it is like i have adjusted my senses to perceive all the background noise in my apartment (or machinery noise (fridge/computer) as voicesmaybe i should move, but i don't really want to, it's not a huge problem for me (assuming i don't get drawn into believing my voices or if i just ignore them)i just wonder, if all that were true and that i somehow damaged myself with static sounds does that really mean i'm schizophrenic with auditory hallucinations or has just my perception of certain sounds altered my brain in this way, i know the only times i ever hear voices outside my apartment is if i've been listening to static for a few hours and then all sounds will start to hear like voicesjust my thoughts, still doesn't explain why i heard those faint voices to begin with unless they were just actual real people talking and i got curious what they were talking about
