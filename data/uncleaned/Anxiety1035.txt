Anxiety around work and my family.Does anyone ever get nervous around there own family. I live with my mother in law and she is just a nervous wreck all the time. I think it rubs off on me and makes me extremely irritable. It's like I feel her energy and demeanor and it just brings out the worst in me. Also, I work in retail, and have trouble with making it to work and when I do, staying. I start straightening the shelves and I get called to the counter to help someone and I almost always expect the worst. It also does not help that we are timed by a system to get help fast for that customer. It could be a little girl or an old lady and I automatically think it's going to be a bad experience. It also does not help that I have been diagnosed with Bipolar. I need help. I go to counseling and take meds. I think this is more a counseling issue with coping. Any advice?
