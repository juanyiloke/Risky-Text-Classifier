Men getting wrong idea?I had an unfortunate enlightened moment lately when an older man I work with, basically said I was a flirt. In fact, he specifically said that I once said that I openly flirt with male bosses to get my way! I never, ever said such a thing and I told him I took great offence at the accusation. In the same conversation he said something along the lines that I had a lovely mischievous smile, a gorgeous face, etc! He said he'd imagine that I'd be very persuasive! WTF?ÊI just found it so inappropriate and am amazed that someone could have gotten such a wrong impression. I am married with children and my only concerns are my family and my career. I dress relatively conservatively at work and have understated hair, jewellery and make up. I am very friendly and polite to both men and women - I talk to everyone, introduce myself to new staff, and like to think I make people feel at ease. It's hard to change who I am but am starting to reconsider this as I am now concerned that others may have the same impression and that it if so, it may be negatively affecting my career.ÊFrankly, I am creeped out and highly embarrassed. I don't know if it's his sole perception of me or if others have the same idea. Essentially, I don't know whether to blame myself or blame him.Does anyone else have experience of similar?
