 New to this site and New to accepting I have an eating disorder...advise please.Hiya, I'm Kelly, I have been suffering with both symptoms of Bulimia and Anorexia for around 16 months now, I came clean to my boyfriend around 3 weeks ago due to people beginning to notice and went to the Dr's on the 18th of July. The Dr has put me for referral as an urgent case.I am still waiting to hear off the Dr's referral now...does anyone know how long it will take?It's all pretty scary at the moment now a few people know...it has pretty much made my eating worse, I am pretty much surviving on very little and things to make myself feel full.Can anyone give me any advise about what will happen when the referral comes through as I am getting pretty anxious with regards to what will happen next. Any advise would be welcome.Thanks Guys  Kel xx
