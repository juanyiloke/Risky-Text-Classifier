ÊDo you think animals can experience psychosis?I had a kitten in college named Willy and unbeknownst to me my roommate smoked my kitten out with marijuana from a very early age and as he grew up he started developing some pretty odd behaviors, like watching things on the ceiling or the wall that weren't there for hours, just mezmerized, or jumping up and flailing his legs when there was nothing there to scare him, he also meowed incessantly at the fridge for hours and hours and hours and we had no idea why (that's not where we kept his food or anything), he also never used the litterbox and just generally wasn't a very functional cat. We also lived on the second story of a house and any time a window was opened even for a second he would try to jump out of the window which would have probably killed him. We eventually moved to a more forested house where he could go outside, but he kept getting lost in neighbors yards until one day he just never came back. Me and my roommates always joked that he was schizophrenic, but I wonder if he really was.ÊI know wild animals can consume large amounts of hallucinogenic mushrooms, and maybe they experience psychosis too? I don't know.ÊKind of a weird question, but anyone have any insight?ÊPS: strangely when I went psychotic at the house alone with Willy one week I developed a hallucination/delusion that he had a shadow twin who wanted me to jump off the roof. I know that's just coincidence, but still weird.
