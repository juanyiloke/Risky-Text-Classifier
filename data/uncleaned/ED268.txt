ÊConfusedHi, I am new to this as it has only hit me today that something is wrong. For a few months now I have been completely obsessed over my weight. I have lost a significant amount of weight in the past few months by eating healthy and excercising. I eat a certain amount of calories per day but excercise excessively to make sure I burn everything off that I have eaten and more. I have recently started to binge and I got myself weighed and had put on a couple of pounds. I was so upset by this that the first thing I did was go home and make myself purge. Since then it has become a very regular occurrence and I do this after each meal? I don't know what to do as I never thought I would do this. Help please?
