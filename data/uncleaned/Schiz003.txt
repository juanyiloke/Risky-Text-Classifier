Am I morally wrong?by grapel86 » Mon Jun 08, 2015 4:35 pmSo, I've been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Anyways, my paranoia gets me to do weird things like listen to my roommate's conversations. I always think she's talking about me in a bad way and I was on the couch and she was in the other room talking to her sister about me. So I confronted her what her and her sister had said about me. She told me last night that it's not right to listen to her conversations because they can be personal, but what the hell you got some nerve to talk about me? Anyways, she gives me an analogy of how a child that is biting other children isn't right so listening to her conversations isn't right neither so I need to stop.How can I live it down when I know she's talking mess about me?Some help would be appreciated about this matter that I have.
