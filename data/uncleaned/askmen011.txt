New supervisor here - have some questions2014-07-08, 11:19 AMI’m 2 weeks into a job as the new supervisor to a team of 8 customer service agents. I’ve been working in the company for 1.5 years as a temp in the marketing division, but just got hired as a permanent employee in this new department. I was a supervisor in the past of a team of 24 that was structured similarly, but I worked my way up through that company and had already mastered the processes and knew and worked with all of the staff before I was promoted.In this new division, in addition to the people, the work involved is new to me as well. I need to learn the processes in order to manage them effectively. I am relying on my reports to show me, as well as studying on my own. There is no structured training regimen. I am suspecting one of the staff applied for the position and is resentful that I got it over them. I could be wrong, but I sense she’s creating a toxic environment and turning the weaker-minded, more easily influenced employees against me as well.At this point in my time here, do I react to these childish acts, or stay focused on learning the tasks of the job and address them once I have the confidence to be able to do something about it? Thanks!
