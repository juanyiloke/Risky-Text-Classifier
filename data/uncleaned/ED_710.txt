Anxiety/ExerciseHello lovelies,I don't think anybody will remember me as I haven't been active in a good while but I'd really appreciate some advice.I got the flu over Christmas, which is now also a chest infection & I'm struggling to breathe. I'm resting all day everyday because that's Alls I can do atm.Thing is, I struggle with extreme anxiety & exercise is part of ED. It also calms my anxiety & helps me function daily.I've been to ill to exercise so I've been self medicating to calm myself but now I have nothing left.I'm having panic attacks & I'm struggling.I tried just forcing myself on a walk with my dog but it was no use - to me that wasn't enough and I was very poorly for the rest of the day.My weight is at it's highest and I really can't cope.ÊHelp.
