asthma attack but good oxygen sats? Can you have good oxygen sats and still be having an asthma attack? Yesterday i had surgery on my throat and when i came round my breathing was very difficult. I had a very definite wheeze on exhalation and that in itself is quite unusual for me. It was really hurting to breathe but the nurses were saying it just felt like i couldn't breathe cos i'd had a local anaesthetic in my throat as well as the general i'd had. I had the oxygen measuring thing on my finger which is probably why they were saying i was breathing ok. They did change me from breathing normal oxygen to humidified oxygen and my breathing eventually calmed down but it was pretty scary at the time :-( I felt like i wanted my inhaler or nebuliser but had neither the breath nor voice to tell them :'(
