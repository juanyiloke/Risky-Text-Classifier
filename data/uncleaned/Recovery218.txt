  For the first time in years, I'm getting so much better!________________________________________I finally got the meds sorted out, and all of a sudden I just don't feel so bad. Then I met a friend in town and made plans, then I got motivated to play volleyball with them and do more with my life. Things are finally looking up, getting better. And if you asked me this two weeks ago I would never believe it. May I steadily heal. For anyone who reads this, never give up, because you will never know what could happen. I've reached my lowest peaks from the summer until fall, then was ready to leave the world, and I just managed to stay a bit longer for what I thought was a silly amount of hope. Then things slowly started to crawl in the right direction...I just got to keep fighting. No, I may not be on top of the world happy or solved for good, but who is to say that can't happen? I'm determined now, more then ever. Even for just one moment of pure bliss, I got to achieve it...And for now, with all that sadness, why not make poems and stories to make something more productive and epic out of it, iron it out, warp it and mold it into something anew...with vigor...
