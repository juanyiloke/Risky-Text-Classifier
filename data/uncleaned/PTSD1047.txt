Less than a year ago, I was raped by my abusive boyfriend. As a result, my mind suppressed those memories for a very long time. By the time I got them back, I was in a healthy, happy relationship with the guy of my dreams- we had even moved in together. But I can see how my PTSD is wearing on him. I have constant panic attacks whenever I see, hear, smell or feel something that remind me of my abuser, the rape itself or the room that it happened in. He is also bi-polar and has a lot of problems in him own life, I am running out of ideas. he cannot go to therapy of any kind due to trauma from when he was a child. I go to therapy once a week but I am not on medications. I didn't want to go on any medications, but now after my latest meltdown and seeing how much they upset him I am more open to going on an anti-anxietymedication or an anti-depression. I already had 'reactive depression' and a very difficult anxiety disorder before the rape. Would perhaps revisiting the area around where it happened help me? I know it would be hard, and I would freak out publicly but if it helps to end this faster, I'll do it. Any ideas, comments or suggestions are much appreciated. I just need this to be over with. I want to be able to have a normal relationship and a functioning life.
