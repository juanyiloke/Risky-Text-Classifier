Global warmingWhen i look at a map of the world and see our tiny island,"I think to myself",how on earth are we going to stop the phenomenon of global warming?.60 years ago when i was at school the scare theme then was if they didn't stop cutting down the rain forests. by the year 2000 all of England would be desert.All very frightening to us kids  but not true. That was the spiel put out by the politicians of the day. Our world will evolve as it has done for millions of years , and there is nothing we can do to stop it happening, The ironical thing is most people including the ruling classes love the warmer climes and go were the sunshine is for their holidaysFunny old world ain't it?
