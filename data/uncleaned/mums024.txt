I don't know why I'm posting this - perhaps reassurance that I'm not overreacting.He lies about everything - constantly. We stopped the once-a-month visits last month as he was always 'forgetting' or turning up with a huge hangover, or not able to make it for some ridiculous reason so it was pointless.I said he could still take Ds to see his grandma, which won't be that often, so yesterday he turned up and took Ds for the day.I barely spoke to him as there was no point but Ds came back quite happy and I knew that he would probably have a nice time.Ex gets out of the car on their return and comes over, saying to me that he will 'drop off ds's birthday present for the 28th'.I know this is most likely not going to happen as he always says he will, then forgets or offers a few quid towards whatever I have already bought. or he turns up with nothing, having promised a gift.Whatever. The point being, Ds's birthday is the 26th. I say 'It's the 26th'.'Yes', says ex. 'Before the 28th.' As though he knew all along.Such a wanker. He could at least have admitted he didn't have a fecking clue when ds's birthday is.Then it transpired his mate took Ds in a sports car round the local area, going very fast indeed, and Ex said 'seriously, do NOT tell your mother'. Which made ds quite upset as he was in a position where he now had to lie to me, or feel like he was telling on his dad.Great. WIBU to push the guy off a cliff if the opportunity arose?
