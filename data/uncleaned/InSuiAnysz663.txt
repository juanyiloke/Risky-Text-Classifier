I found out about my gpa and it was just what I was expecting.ÊI'm going to fix it up next semester. I can't afford to screw it again.There's just so much going on right now. From constant pressure at home to finding work and this. I feel like giving up.I know people say it's selfish but I have people around me who constantly bring me down in the deepest pit and afterwards say "I love you". I am confused and I don't know if I could go on with this lifestyle anymore. I know I am only in college but I feel like I am going nowhere anyway and I am just a piece of **** (well that's what I get told a lot).I want to be able to not worry anymore and not feel this way and shut everything out. It's natural that people come and go. People have to accept that.
