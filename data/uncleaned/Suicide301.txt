this is the hardest thing I've ever wroteThis is really hard for me, and well sorry in advance if I do it wrong,I'm 22, and since I was 16 when my 'dad' came into my life, things have just been dull, I've not been happy for as long as I can remember, at the same time as my dad appearing on the scene I had just lost my gran who was the most amazing woman in my life, and even writing this post I feel I've let her down, she warned me about my dad, and well I wanted to learn for myself and I really wish now I took her advice, I've always been as others would seem strong, independant (although my mum and stepdad are great, but I have pushed them away in the last few years), happy and hopeful, but in reality inside I just feel blank, I do love people, my sister and brother mean the world to me and well my brother and I aren't close and I don't even know if he knows I care, he grew up thinking I hated him. I can't remember the last time I hugged my mum or said I love her despite living 300 ft away, and well my stepdad, we only speak when I'm working on his car.. When I get angry, I snap, I don't have like a chart of emotions, I'm either okay or breaking someones head, although I don't like it and very rarely get angry it scares me, and well only one other thing scares me is the fact of taking my own life, which over the years I have had thoughts of doing it, but the fear has kept me grounded and trust me I'm so glad I have that fear.. But the fears fading and its really discomforting.. I can't ask for help, I don't want someone I know looking down on me, feeling sorry for me, or stating the obvious.. I don't know what to do, other than hope that fear never diminishes completely.. Any advice?
