Probably the wrong place to post, but wondered if anyone has been to kiddicare in Peterborough this year? I went last year in the summer before they were bought out and shut all the other shops, and am considering driving there again as there are quite a few things I need that I'd like to see before I buy. When the other shops shut I'm sure I read that the Peterborough shop was going to be reducing also, and wondered if it's still worth a visit?When does your 18 month old nap and go to bed for the night? I know every baby is different but I'm finding my little one isn't going to bed till 830pm.. He still has 1 nap a day and he sleeps through the night so believe me I'm not complaining!! Just think 830 is late for a baby to be going to bed?? And he wakes about 6? 630? So it isn't like he stays up later and has a lie in? When does your 18 month old nap and go to bed for the night?
