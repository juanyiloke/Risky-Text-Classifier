Food choice strugglesI'm a type 2 diabetic who does not test. I am really struggling to lose weight and feel this is down to struggling with food choices and not knowing if I am eating the right things throughout the day and making the correct snacking choices. I rarely eat when hungry and eat if bored.Breakfast is usually low fat yoghurt with granola and frozen berries, lunch is a sandwich with salad and tea is a slimming world meal cooked by my wife. Snacks are apple banana and orange and a low calorie ceral bar. Supper is usually a few biscuits again not because I'm hungry just because I'm sat on computer or watching tv. Cant seem to lose any weight currently at 20st 7lb and really need to lose at least 2st. As I get frustrated I tend to start snacking on chocolate bars which I know doesn't help and then lunch also becomes a free for all and will have a kfc or cheesy chips and gravy, this then leads to me being depressed as the poor choices made so I go into self destruct mode and snack on chocolate and biscuits. Can anybody offer any advice. I leave for work at 530am and don't get home till 6pm. I realise most of the problem is with the choices I make but I don't seem to have the willpower to stop eating the wrong things. My body also doesn't seem to feel any difference no matter what I eat.
