ÊRestlessnesHi, I have been taking my medication like my doctor said, for the past 5 months....and although I don't get any hallucinations...but I am restless and agitated all the time... I also feel the need to explain everything to myself....I can't get theses obsessive thoughts out of my head and I am also restless and pacing all the time... the thought I am having aren't useful thought at all...they are kind of like explanation to someone who will judge me if I don't explain myself to them...what can I do to feel better...how can I get these obsessive thoughts out of my head and how can I feel calm.
