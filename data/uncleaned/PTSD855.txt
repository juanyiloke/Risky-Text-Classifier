Êhypervigilance, anxiety and abuse in the familyIt is not nice suffering from PTSD especially where the traumatic stress is ongoing and is not stopped so that recovery can commence. Feelings of fear, anxiety and panic attacks occur when a patient is worried about the security and welfare of family members whose versions of the truth in relation to physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect differ from one another and a patient is left feeling alone and experiencing abusive relationships that can cause the patient to loose sleep. Child abuse or vulnerable adult abuse can bring about feelings of anger, resentment and much hypervigilance especially within broken families where allegations have been made that are denied by loved ones and support networks. PTSD sufferers need plenty of fsupport and enjoy the company of friends of friends but investigating very important matters can be internally damaged and family can have misunderstandings falsely perceived as shared psychosis and hatred resulting in serious sleep disturbances and a denial of truth of one consciousness within family units and support networks. The solution must be to try to relax and focus on recovery and psychological therapy and relation techniques like massage therapy and reiki and yoga may help but a patient must have an understanding support network around them in order to end the awful symptoms of PTSD and return to a productive life where trust overcomes distrust. Distrust causes stress and loneliness where friends have been dismissed as a result of parental concerns and trusting the wrong people. PTSD sufferers may or may not experience psychotic symptoms but ongoing stress and trauma is awful if support networks are motivated by selfish interests.
