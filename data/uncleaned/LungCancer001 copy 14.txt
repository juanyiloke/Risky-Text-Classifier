needing advice pleaseOk so I have been going through this ordeal for a little over a year now. Last year I was hospitalized with heart issues. I asked them to please check my thyroid levels while I was there because I have been having alot of symptoms relating to thyroid issues. Sure enough my blood work came back that I I had hyperthyroidism. The doc didn't want to go into treatment as I have other complications or that's what she said. So for over a year now I have been dealing untreated. About 5 weeks ago I started having troubles catching my breath. Cardiologist said heart was looking great after several tests. So he then sent me for chest x-ray. After that a CT scan. They found a 9x9x12 nodule on my right lower lobe with rimmed calcifications . They were going to send me to EENT for a biopsy and decided to do an ultrasound instead. I have since got the findings. There is alot on it that I don't understand and have tried numerous times to get answers from my provider but no luck yet. The report says there is so much calcification that a fine needle aspiration would not work and that its likely I will need surgery to get a diagnosis. Im worried to say the least. Should I be?
