The mistakes men make when chatting ladies up...Im pretty sure a thread of this nature has been put up before, but i was just wondering, as its a lazy sunday evening after my night out, if anyone would entertain my discussion.Basicly, its been a while since iv been out or chatted up, so last night i noticed a few things in terms of men chatting you up.ÊMen dont really want to make the effort to get to know anything about you, one guy in the space of 2 minutes shook my hand, told me he was from kerry and asked me was i single. Not in an entertaining jokey way, it was more like he was interviewing me for a job or checking me off a list.Also, theres a bit of a lack of tact with some men. Another guy was great fun, loads of chat, lots of flirting, but decided mid conversation the girl at the next table was very hot and wanted to discuss this in depth with me. I laughed, left him off to chat her up, she had none of it, so he came back to chat me up again. Seriously? Bit of cop on!Any other cardinal sins a man can make when hes chatting you up? excamples are great!
