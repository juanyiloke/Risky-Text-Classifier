Reconstruction - back muscle¥	Hi,¥	I haven't posted since I had my surgery, 11th February, partly because I sort of feel guilty because I don't have to have any more treatment and all I have to do now is recover.  Reading that it sounds wrong and illogical but it's how I'm feeling.¥	Anyway, has anyone had a reconstruction using the back muscle?  I just want to get some feedback from anyone that has had this and how difficult was the recovery.  At the moment I'm in a lot of pain, eight weeks after the reconstruction, and wishing I'd never had it done.  My new 'boob' hurts, I have a lot of pain in my underarm and there's also the lump where the muscle was pulled through and also my back scar that is healing. ¥	I know the surgeon did a good job but I hate it and just want the pain to stop.  I can't even take anything stronger than paracetamol because they make me ill. My poor husband can't help me and I know that is making him feel absolutely useless.¥	Thanks¥	Jenny
