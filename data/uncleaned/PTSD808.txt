ÊI think that I may have PTSDI am not sure but after reading stuff online about PTSD, I think I may have it. I avoid talking about some stuff that happened to me and memories of them keep coming back no matter how hard I try to not think about them and certain things and words tend to trigger feelings of fear and I have trouble thinking afterwards. I mean I actually avoid doing things that I associate with negativity including stuff that really aren't so bad like cleaning or even brushing my teeth. I sort of associate brushing my teeth for more than one minute or less as a punishment which is a bit hard to explain. I also freak out if people point out that I missed a spot while cleaning and act as if they are going to yell at me and force me to do it over again even if it took me two hours to finish. I'm not asking for a diagnosis here but rather opinions on whether or not these things are considered traumatic events.
