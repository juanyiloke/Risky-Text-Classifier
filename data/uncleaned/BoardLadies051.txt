ÊWhy do you want/ not want children?Just a follow on from the what age children thread.I often wonder why some don't want kids? I'm sure they wonder why some want kids!!ÊYou get me, I couldn't imagine my life without children in it and if I were to have had issues concieving, I would have have went a different route to have children, ivf/adopt etc..I wanted kids because I love kids,I feel for me it was meant to be, I wanted to be a mam, I love being a mam. I want to have loads of grandchildren around me when I'm old. If god forbid something happens to me when I'm older, I'll have that support help from my children hopefully! not a reason but a perk I suppose!What are your reasons?
