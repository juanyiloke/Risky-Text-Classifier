Doctor says im no longer diabetic?Hi guys just back from the doctors and my long term bloods came back as 37/5.5 so doctor has told me i am no longer diabetic and to come off the metformin. A bit confused because id guess i can eat as i was ? lol.Granted i have lost 3.5 stones in last 4 months and if im not careful i will head into negative territory soon - this has mainly though not tolerating the metformin well for the 1st 3 months till i was swapped onto the slow release.So her advice is eat more carbs - sigh. anyway - can i really be non diabetic?? or is it really because i have changed my diet totally and if so does eating more mean i will raise again - especially with no metformin in me. I havnt been cast adrift though i am to see her again in 3 months - kinda assume ill still be registered diabetic on there books so will have the 6 month yearly checks?. Hmmm never asked that question. Sorry about rambling on but am a little unsure of what is happening - thanks for listening lol
