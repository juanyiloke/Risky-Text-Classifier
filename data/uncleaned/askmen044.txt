Being ignored at work2013-11-03, 07:26 PMSo I feel like I'm being ignored by my team leader at work. Mind you this individual is not my manager but basically the next in line. I'm not certain if I said anything wrong to him. But lately it seems like he is asking everyone else if they need help and not me. (Even people that are not as productive as myself). I know that he did like me at one point in time, my manager even told me so.ÊBut I was never all that close to him. Unfortunately it is kind of hurting my feelings that he's not speaking to me anymore. What should I do?
