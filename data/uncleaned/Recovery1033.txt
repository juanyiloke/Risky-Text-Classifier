I Now Have My Own E Business or, How Far I Have ComeWhen I thank back to when I first found this site, I didnt want to live. I thought that I was monster. And the only feelings I could trust was pain and sorrow. It has been a struggle from time to time since. But while I havent made a buck yet, I know I will and that it is only a matter of time. And for a person with severe depression to take the time and build a site and actually sell things on it...yes I think I have improved, mentally speaking of course. And the best part is that not only do I have a chance to make some much needed moolah, but I will be helping people at the same time!I would post the link here, but I dont want to be accused of spamming the board.I just had to share this with you guys!!
