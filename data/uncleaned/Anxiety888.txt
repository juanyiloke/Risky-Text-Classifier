Screaming in my head.It's weird, I have it less often but I got it the other day and was just curious. I'll be doing something mundane like sorting the laundry or something, and it will come, it feels like I'm screaming, but all the physical actions have been removed and just the mental experience of screaming remains, I act completely normal but in my head I'm freaking out. It's not as though I actually hear the screaming or anything it's just as if my mind's gone into overdrive, it's hard to explain. And I get a weird kind of nostalgia that doesn't make any sense, like I'm listening to a song I haven't heard in years of something. It's happened to me every few months since I can remember. It's not particularly scary, it can be kind of enjoyable just because it's so weird. Thought it might be anxiety related, not sure. Let me know if this has happened to you.
