This was cruelThis morning I went for my CT scan. From there to my primary care doctor to view the results. Good news. I have 3 small spots on my right lung that can be corrected with surgery. So he makes an appointment at the Oncology office for me. One hour later I am sitting in the oncologists office and he tells me I am stage four and there isn't much he can do for me. The fluid is coming back on my lung and because of the cancer cells in the fluid the entire site is contaminated and surgery is not an option. So in one hour I went from winning the lottery to getting my death warrant signed. I am going to Milwaukee to have a chest tube put in to drain all the fluid and insert some type of medication. I am also scheduled for a lot of tests I don't understand. Pet scan, brain MRI are the only two I remember right now. After all of this is done he will figure out the best plan for me. Told me my outlook is really grim. I liked the first doctor better!
