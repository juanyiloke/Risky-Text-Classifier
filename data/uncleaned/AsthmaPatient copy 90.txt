Asthma Peak FlowsPosted 3 months agoHiI have had Asthma for about 8 years. I have an auto-immune disease that causes it.My auto-immunie disease is not currable (Churg Struass Syndrome), I have tried all the medications, none work.  My gut does not digest steriods although I take them. Currently on 500ml Methyl Pred infusions every 6 weeks.  I also have Rituximab infusions every 6 months.  Nothing is really working for my disease. I do not have a respiratory consultant, I had one who was useless, totally useless. Long story.  I saw my Asthma Nurse at local surgery a couple of weeks ago, useless.  My peak flow was 270 which was good for me, although not taken it since last Asthma attack 18 months ago.  However, it was checked at my ENT hospital yesterday it was 110 at best lowest 90. I have no idea how bad my lungs are, what to do.  GP not interested either.  I hardly ever go outside because I am so ill with my CSS, my breathing is poor with exercise, just normal walking and every day tasks kill me.  Just getting so worried as went out yesterday to ENT by Ambulance as I am so ill, just walking a few yards to the ambulance had to take 10 puffers to breathe normally, scared the life out of the driver.Its not on, should someone be looking after my Asthma?  Because I have a auto-immune problem GP says see consultant, consultant says see GP.  If I don't go out or move I am fine I suppose, just with exertion I am breathless, hubby getting scared now that I am left like this and my lungs are shot.Sorry for asking the above, just getting worried need to know what all this is.  One good thing I never, ever get chest infections etc, never. But I am constantly ill with the Churg Strauss auto-immune illness.
