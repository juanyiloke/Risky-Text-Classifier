StrugglingHello, I am new to this forum and to the land of diabetes (ish). I was diagnosed on New Years eve as type 1 and in hosp for a few days. I have brought my bg readings down, but my insulin doses change every now and then as I am honeymooning. I work full time and currently planning my wedding (June this year). I thought I was coping quite well with everything but have been really struggling the last couple of weeks. I'm constantly tired and the last few days have been on the verge of tears. I was sent home from work yesterdY - my manager asked me if I was ok and I started crying :/ I just don't feel like I can cope. Everything I read seems to be negative and tells me of all the complications I can expect. I don't know how to get out of this black hole and onto a more positive path. Any advice greatly appreciated x
