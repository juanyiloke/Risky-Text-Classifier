Êthree person babysat the moment it's replacing mitochondria to stop illness but how long before it becomes replacing chromosomes that carry certain illnesses or replacing certain genes on those chromosomesIt's just what makes me me and would i be me with a chromosome replacedMy lesbian friend said if they had found a gene for been gay and i'd been aborted i might object to it now but if i'd have been aborted there would have been no me to objectAnd if they'd found a gene for schitzoprenia and say my mother a strict catholic had refused to abort, it'd be on my records since a baby, what point educating me to uni level when that clock was ticking to crisis at 19 better to educate me to process benefit forms and independent living skills as i'd never marry, in some ways that might be better
