Ativan questions. Ê9    Alright so, I have a couple questions I hope someone can answer for me as I can't speak with a doctor today because it's Sunday.Alright well, I take ativan for anxiety and to help with dizzy spells and such because I have what the docs think is Labyrinthitis. I won't know until I can see a ENT. I take it as needed so not that often because I'm not to happy about taking meds. So far every time I've taken them when was dizzy, depersonalized, and anxious or panicking they worked fine. Day before yesterday I took one when I was out and about and I felt off and weird but it calmed down. It did help a bit. Last night I had a bad dizzy episode where my body was swaying. and such not terribly anxious but it was there. So I took one, the rest of the night I felt so tired and super anxious. I wasn't really dizzy but I was very I anxious, weird head sensations and my memory was crap. Its like I could feel the ativan working but only making me tired and trying to put me to sleep, yet every time I tried I would wake up in pure panic or an anxiety attack but I didn't want to move. Could it have been a silent migraine or maybe my body needed more ativan to get me calm? It was a very weird situation that I do not want to go through again.. My girlfriend kept telling me to take another one but I was nervous. I take 0.5 mg. I took it around 430 and this lasted until about 1am and was finally able to sleep. please someone help me out here.
