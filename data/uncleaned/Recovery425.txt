  Possible hope for me after allAfter being here for a couple days maybe I had some ups and downs. In real life and here sharing with all of you. There might be a chance for me that hope really exists. Cause I'm FINALLY talking to my therapist. What ever happens in the time we talk might be something or info that could change my outlook on life, and help me beat this endless sadness. Or manage it better. Who knows. I just want to thank the people that helped me on here so far. With out your support I wouldn't be here. So thanks so much.I could go on forever about myself and what I been through but I'll keep it short . If you want to know more about my story or myself just pm me.
