Dilated pupils/blurry vision on Fluoxetine Hi im 20 years old and been put on 20mg of fluoxetine, i have been on them for about 2-3 weeks now and found recently my vision has been blurry when trying to focus on things far away or even close sometimes. My pupils also look a lot bigger than they did before i started on them.I have always had perfect eye sight so its pretty noticeable and wondering if this is a permanent thing?I'm not going to stop but wondering if i ever did my eyesight would go back to normal or am i stuck like this now? Thanks!Fluoxetine and my side effects Hi not been here for a while as i have been trying really hard to get my life back on track, my doctor put me on prozac about 10 days ago and i have been having quite a few side effects.My stomach has been playing up a bit and ive been getting headaches and feeling more stressed every now and again but ive also noticed my teeth have gone so sensitive, biting down doesn't hurt but i feel pain of some sort. This has started since i have taken them and just wondering if it could be the meds??Got my appointment next week but was just curious before, thanks!!Â
