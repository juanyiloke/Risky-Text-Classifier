ÊHas anyone had experience of Mentalization-Based Treatment?Hi. My name is Heather. I'm really trying to get in contact with people who've had experience of mentalization-based treatment (MBT). I really want to learn about the subjective experience of people who've actually done it, rather than 'professional opinions'.ÊJust so you know a little bit about me. I have a personal interest in this but also an educational one as well. I'm currently a 2nd year Psychology Trainee doing a DPsych at the University of Surrey. I'm looking for people to talk to me about their experience of MBT. Here is a link to my website with all the information in case you're interested in helping me out ;-) I am truly grateful to everyone who takes the time to read this. I think it's so important to raise awareness of your experience which is sorely lacking in the current literature.Êthank you, Heather :-)
