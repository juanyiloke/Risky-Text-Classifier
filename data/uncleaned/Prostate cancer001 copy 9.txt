First good news for months Hello allI am 47 and was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in October 2014. My PSA was 7.4 and a biopsy gave me a Gleeson score of 3+3An MRI scan was inconclusive and I was offered a range of treaments. My OH researched tirelessly on the internet, and we gathered as much information as we could about the options available to me. I was fortunate enough to be offered a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy which was done in January 2015. I say fortunate, because my local health authority don't have the DaVinci Robot at any of their hospitals but it was decided by the Multi Disciplinary Team that I would be one of the lucky ones offered the chance to travel to a neighboughring health authority which did have the technology.Today is 4 weeks since the op and I have been given the first bit of good news since I walked into my GP's surgery in August. My PSA is less than 0.01% which initially suggest that the treatment has been succesful. I will have a full post op briefing in 3 weeks when I will be told about the pathologists report on the removed prostate and any potential issues. But so far so very good.Having spent the last few months closing myself off from the world, I now feel I can, and should share my experiences with others.We made an amazing thing when we made the NHS.Welshman
