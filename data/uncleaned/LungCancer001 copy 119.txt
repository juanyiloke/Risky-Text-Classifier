lung cancer with met to the brainI found out in April that I have lung cancer that spread to my brain. I am 55 years old, and scared, yet docs seem to be encouraging because they have removed all 3 masses from brain with gamma knife, and they keep saying I barely have cancer, very little cancer and can have a good quality of life even with treatment. anyone else had diagnosis like this? They say I am strong, 100% ambulatory, and still have all my functions, etc., has not spread to bones or blood, should I get my hopes up?
