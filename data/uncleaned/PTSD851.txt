Êdissociation and body memories.I believe that I am stuck with both flashbacks for what is in my mind, and also physical body memories (BM) flashbacks.ÊThis means that despite all the work I do on my emotional mental problems, at the moment I can't stop the BM flashbacks which are stored in my physical body.For those who do not understand what a body memory is. It is the trauma that happens to your body whilst whatever traumatic circumstance you are suffering is occuring. A traumatic event may render you unconscious, blacking out to escape the pain say, but the body is still being tortured.ÊI have no control over these BM flashbacks. I can suddenly start shaking uncontrollably in any given situation. I also experience body shocks where it feels like I have an electric shock shooting through my body. I know that when I was treated with electric shock therapy in 1972 at some point I was rendered unconscious as my mind tried to escape the pain. I dissociated.ÊDissociation is not always a bad thing. it certainly saved me experiencing the pain, unfortunately no amount of dissociation will stop the body experiencing the pain.ÊSo there may be a time when you experience feelings in your body that do not make any sense. You don't know what is going on. I had one BM of an excruciating pain and itch im my right forearm. My GP thought it was an allergic reaction to something, but despite all the treatment the pain continued. It wasn't until I realised (it took 10 years) that the pain only appeared in certain stressful situations. When my mind finally realised that the electrodes by which I was shocked in 1972 were attached to my right forearm the pain went away and never came back.
