Binge/Starve CycleHi,So this is my first time to try to write anything (to ANYONE) about my problems.Lately, I have been caught in a serious binge/starve cycle. I do not know what to do. My stomach feels so terrible, I feel incredibly guilty, and even though time and time again I tell myself that it will get better the next day, I completely prove myself wrong and go back to my terrible habits.I keep telling myself to stay strong, to just go back to normal eating patterns, but psychologically it's scary for me to even pick up my utensil because I know I won't be able to control myself.I really want to go back to the old days when eating was something I could do without fear of going overboard, when food didn't control my life. I am scared of myself and what my body is doing.I'm really sorry that this post is just me venting out my fears, but I had nowhere else to turn. Without a doubt in the world, I want to recover. I just don't know where to start.
