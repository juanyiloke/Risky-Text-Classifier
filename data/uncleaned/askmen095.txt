How do you make it in today's world (financially)2012-10-12, 11:09 AMIm in my early 20's (live in U.S), and for the past few years after graduating college, I always wanted a career and was tired of the same old dead end jobs. I also wanted a nice girl. Well 1st came the girl, then a year later, came the career. I wanted to have a future where i get married and have kids, and my wife doesnt have to work, she can stay home and take care of the kids.I started my career, and all i heard about was how this is a great paying career and how the money is good. So I started to naturally get excited, that in a couple of years, ill be on my way, to getting married, a house all that good stuff, the american dream.Now, mind you im at the starting salary, so obviously my salary will go up alot over the years, but for now, my starting salary was expected to be good and be a noticeable difference from the salary i made last year with my Job.Well, after receiving my 1st 2 paychecks, i've come to realize that my pay sucks and im not making much money, and idk how the hell ill ever be able to afford a house and family one day.. My starting salary actually isn't bad, BUT, after TAXES and all other deductions (union fees and pension fund) my take home is horrible. My total deductions (tax & other deductions) are $550 a check!I understand my salary will go up, but when my salary goes up, so will my taxes.ÊHow do you guys manage in today's world? Are your deductions from your paychecks this high? I live in NY by the way, but federal tax is im guessing the same in every state, and im sure you guys have other non tax deductions such as health benefits and pension funds etc..
