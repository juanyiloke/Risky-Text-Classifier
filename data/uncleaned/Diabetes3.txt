HbA1c result since LibreMy HbA1c result last November was a slightly disappointing 53 (worst since I got the pump the previous November), although very acceptable considering where I was drifting previously. I got the Libre at the end of November and my first HbA1c since then yesterday - 43! This is stunning!I do recognise however that I am probably still getting too many lows showing in this result. The Libre has demonstrated just how many times I go low after 4 or 5 hours - I always seem to get a late hit of insulin and am trying to train myself to check more at that time (shame there is no possibility of an alarm, I know it doesnt work like that) If I reduce the amount of insulin I get much more of a spike. There seems to be no such thing as a straight line unless I don't eat at all! Protein seems to act as my energy source in the complete absence of carbohydrates. Still resisting having to give up sandwiches!!The other bad news with the Libre is that I am definitely allergic to the adhesive, my doctor has given me hydrocortisone cream to mend nasty red blistered scars. I am trying out alternative methods of sticking to skin - wish me luck, I can't do without it now!
