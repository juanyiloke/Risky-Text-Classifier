Steroids and Chemo Can anybody out there who has gone through chemo clarify something for us? Do you just take steroids for three days over the start of each chemo session or is there a low dose taken throughout treatment? We have been told different things by the onco's registrar who first said it was only over three days then came back and said she was sorry she had got it wrong and it was throughout the treatment at low dose and higher dose three days. At the pre assessment last week the nurse said it was only over three days?? I would like to know exactly what we should be expecting.Thanks in advance.Max "You can only play the hand you're dealt" Nervous Results day today and am awaiting it with trepidation. Will I be glad when its over or not? Who's to say. My spouse was diagnosed on December 12 with g9 metastasised to bones and lymphs. Gone through treatment, ticking off as we go..decapeptyl, started to resist in October 13, bicalutamide added and that also failing.Awaiting results of bone and ct scans today at onco appointment. We have already been told by him to cancel holiday as likely to be chemo.It seems like watching a train coming and knowing you should get off the line but can't move. Some a called it a rocky road and it does seem to be that that with treatments as stations along the route.Sorry to vent on here, but it seems to be the only place I can. My spouse is totally chilled and taking it in his stride....or so it seems! I know he's worried as well but speaking words would make it real.Thanks for listening. Just saying it makes me feel better.Max "You can only play the hand you're dealt"
