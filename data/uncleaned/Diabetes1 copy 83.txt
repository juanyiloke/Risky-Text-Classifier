"poorly controlled" = our faultSo, I know this guy, he's a T1, involved in some unpleasant litigation. His health is a material issue in this litigation. He has a letter from his hospital consultant stating he is poorly controlled, and advising what some of the implications of this fact are for current and future health. The other side in this litigation are arguing that "poorly controlled" means it's his fault, under his control, his failure, and therefore they shouldn't have to account for his state of health.Now you and I know that "poorly controlled" means "he's doing his best with the tools he's got, but he's just not succeeding, like very many other diabetics who don't manage to succeed with the tools we give them - no blame is attached".However, given how the general public might interpret the phrase "poorly controlled", maybe it's time for a change of terminology from our dear Health Care Professionals?Or am I wrong, and the HCPs actually are blaming those of us who are "poorly controlled" for being the cause of our own misfortune?
