Does my company own my work?2014-01-19, 03:50 PMI'm making tutorial on how to use a popular product that the company I work for will be using to teach kids who come into their building, on how to program, or the instructors may use it as a guide to teach.The tutorial is for programming third party software and hardware. I have made two tutorials versions one type typed out in MS Word pages and another that looks like an offline website built using html. Now I realize that I could turn the HTML tutorial into an app and maybe sell it or give it out for free on an app market like the android app market.ÊI have gotten paid to work on this, and I've also worked on it a bit at home. Does my company own my product or just the right to use? What would my limitations be?ÊMy contract doesn't say anything about ownership of such creations.My contract is pretty much a customer service contract.
