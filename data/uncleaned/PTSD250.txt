Can a child who was emotionally abused develop PTSD?by 7ilovelucy » Wed Sep 03, 2014 11:18 pmFor example if someone who Is supposed to be an authority figure, in a Place that is supposed to be safe, emotionally/psychologically abused a child, would it be possible for that child toDevelop PTSD? What it liken the chances if the child had been verbally abused when they were much younger? What are the chances? What if while they were being abused, there friends were going through the same thing, and the parents didn't believe them, therefore the child had no one to talk to about it? At the same time, the child was trying to help friends that were cutting and burning themselves, because of the abuse, and caused added stress? What if the child is already suffering with a known anxiety disorder (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and likely depression?Would any of this affect the chances of developing PTSD?I am currently seeing a therapist. I was tested for PTSD because I show some symptoms. (Panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, etc....) I scored 'very likely' on my First screening. I scored very high in all 4 categories required to be diagnosed with PTSD. I am going to see a psychiatrist in 2 weeks. The problem is, is that I didn't really go through anything 'traumatic' just some emotional/ verbal abuse and bullying.
