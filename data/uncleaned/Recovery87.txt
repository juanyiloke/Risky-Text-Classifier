New Here, Support And Advice Please?Hello, im here because im hoping it will help me cure myself and i can start to enjoy life again! It would mean so much if you could share tips and advice! (20yo male)I had depression at my worst late last year and since then its been on/off! I can be relativity happy one moment and upset and down the next when i think of the depression causes. (Below) Feel majorly underpreciated at work, dont get treated fairly, and felt like ive been picked on in past by senior staff, no career! Used to enjoy work but not i hate it!Dont have many close friends (1 or 2)... Fell in love with my close bestfriend! The love is unrequited and he knows how i feel about him! It hurts so much when he talks about his relationahips! And its hard to move on! Can not and will not stop this friendship as its too important!Over weight, feel unatractive, ugly and that no one will ever love me! Feeling so lonely! Feel like it stops me from living my life as i should. But feel too down to change!All i want is a happy life, and to meet the person of my dreams! Have no confidence whatsoever! Which is stopping me from getting a new job and meeting new people! Just dont know what to do!Please help me or give me support! Thank youMatt
