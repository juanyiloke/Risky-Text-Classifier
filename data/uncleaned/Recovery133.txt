(Possibly) Strange Way To CopeI'm going to put this here because I'm not sure where else it would go, and it really is just a general.....observation of mine.Most days of the week I can manage to get through without really showing any signs of depression, but every once in a while usually 3 times a month I will go into an extrememly sudden downswing in mood where I actually cannot bring myself to leave the house and sometimes even my room. About a year ago (I've had my official diagnosis going on 3 years now, lot of help that did when I was feeling the same way for 9 years) I happened to be in a chatroom with some people I game online with and everyone was linking music they listen to. Normally I wouldn't bother clicking any of the links, let alone when I was far enough down to be seriously considering suicide, but something caught my eye in one the songs.The song was "Wet Leather" by the band "Woods of Ypres". I listenened to it once, then again and one more time before pulling up a playlist search for more of their music and within a week I had purchased the entire discography and a whole bunch of other merchandise from them.The strange part n the topic title is that Woods is a "blackened doom" band, meaning for the non-metal enthusiasts that they take elements from doom metal (think black sabbath and other potentially depressive drone-like sounds) and black metal (very theatrical music with harsh vocals and strictly dark lyrical themes, such as death and satanism and the like). Something about the sound just made me feel better about myself and now whenever I get to the point of hardly being able to make it through the day I go and I listen to not only Woods of Ypres but other extraordinarily depressing music like "Anathema" and "Katatonia" and too many others to begin to list.I guess this whole thing is just to ask if any of you that took the time to read this find this odd or have other similarly "abnormal" coping mechanisms or habits.
