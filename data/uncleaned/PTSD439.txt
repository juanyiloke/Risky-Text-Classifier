ÊWill my attachment hold back trauma treatment?I have been in therapy for a few years now and developed a very strong attachment to my t after a couple of years. Most of our work has been around that attachment and around my relationship with my mum. However, last year I shared something with my t and since then I have had PTSD symptoms. I had probably had a lot of the symptoms before- I have always had night terrors, for example. However, they have become more obvious and getting worse. I have no memories of any trauma and the couple of flashbacks I have had have been emotional ones - no visuals. Anyway. Now therapy is dealing with both areas. The problem is my t is trying very hard to get me to self soothe, to stabilise me I guess in terms of trauma treatment. But the child part of me is so stubborn and does not want my adult part to soothe her; she only wants my t. She is desperate for t to do it and rebels when my t tries to get my adult part to do it. When my t tries to ground me and bring me back to adult (when I've been in child) my little one refuses to go away. She feels rejected by my t and becomes very rebellious. My t can always get me back eventually but it's a fight. And it's a real struggle to get me to self soothe. This week my t asked if I had thought about EMDR. She is not trained so it would mean visiting another t. (No trust). If I did EMDR, it appears that you need the ability to be stable and self-regulate. I'm wondering if maybe my trauma treatment does need to be with someone else anyway but don't want to leave t. Has anyone else had this problem of attachment conflicting with trauma therapy? How did it resolve? Thanks in advance.
