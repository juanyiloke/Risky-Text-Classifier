a sensitive issueHi I am 19 years old with a very tight foreskin. I have read on the web that this can be caused by unusual masturbation techniques. Since the age of 11/12 I have masturbated daily using an unusual technique (with my left hand). In an atrempt to resolve my tight foreskin issue, I have started masturbating the "normal" way but this doesn't work with my left hand and I have to use my right. This is a very slow process and it takes me a long long time to reach climax, sometimes an hour or longer compared to 10 mins or so using my usual way..Has anyone else experience this or has anyone any advice?Thanks guys
