Has anyone been on Zyflo CR?________________________________________I was on Singulair, but was having to use ProAir and my nebulizer too much, so my allergy/asthma doctor has replaced the Singulair with a stronger form of it, he says, called Zyflo CR. So far, I am breathing much better with it and Symbicort, plus Flonase for my allergies. I will have to have several liver tests while on Zyflo and most pharmacies have never heard of it, and I finally found it as a specialty pharmacy, so I was wondering if anyone else had been prescribed it, and, if so, what your experience with it was.
