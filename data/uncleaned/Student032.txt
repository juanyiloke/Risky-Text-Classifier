Halls or student housing?by justyna.malkiewAs a soon to be first year undergraduate student, I have a number of things I need to think about, like a lot of us. One of those, is obviously accommodation. So, I have been wondering, halls of residence or student housing? On one hand it seems like halls of residence are the classic experience, with meeting loads of new people and the pranks people pull on each other etc. Student housing seems a much more calm option, like its not as crazy, but it also feels to me like sort of missing out on a lot of fun, but obviously this may be just very stereotypical thinking. Anyone with experience willing to give a few pointers and own opinions?
