I have adult onset asthma. Diagnosed 2007. I used to use Singulair, Advair, Combivent (as needed). I stopped using these about 6 months to a year ago due to my lack of attacks or difficulty. And $$$$. Here's the question. Even when I was on the medicine, I would go through these periods(days/week) where I was constantly yawning. Most of the time I couldn't complete the yawn. It felt like the air wouldn't go on down. Now I'm in the midst of one of these periods again. My peak flow readings are very good. My o2 sat is very good. My incentive spirometry is good. I don't know what this is. It's been happening for several years. Does this happen to anyone else besides me? It's very aggravating. I asked my pulmonologist one time and he really didn't give me an answer. Just shrugged it off. Does anyone know what would cause this? Thanks. BobSue
