struggling with anorexiaTo anyone out there who is strugggling with any ED please seek help, i wish i had sooner. Ive struggled with my relationship with food since i was 18 and im now 50, im supposedly in recovery and have just spent 2 months in ED unit then previous to this five stays in hospital from Psychiatric to medical. My BMI is currently 15.6 and finding each day a chore, i only feel slightly better if the scales tell me ive lost, i feel depressed all the time. I live a lonely life as i dont have a good network of friends and family, i try to hide it from my 18yr old son as he worries. Im not really sure what i want to say i guess just that anyone else out there seek help earlier, go to your doctor tell a friend but dont suffer alone.
