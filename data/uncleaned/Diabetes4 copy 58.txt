Glucophage SR shortage.After years of ordering all meds myself as and when needed I got fed up as none of them lined up and I was there every 2 mins with another request.  So a while ago I asked the Pharmacist to manage my repeats and today was the day I had to collect them all.I checked all the various pills and was annoyed to find I'd been given Bolamyn SR, because I've seen members on here complaining that they get the same side effects as ordinary metformin.  So I asked could I change them to my normal Glucophage.  Apparently there's a shortage of Glucophage SR & they can't get it in (this is a small chemist which used to be independant but is now a branch of Boots).  The pharmacist asked me how many a day I took and I told him 4 x 500mg so he was able to give me some 1000mg Glucophage tablets so I can take 2 a day instead of 4.  He said they were awful big to swallow, but when he showed me I told him they were the same size as the 500mg ones and 2 less to swallow.
