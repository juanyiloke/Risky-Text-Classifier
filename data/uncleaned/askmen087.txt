Drawing a line where helping others is not right for oneself2012-11-29, 04:23 PMJust to make it simple and start this conversation, I am curious.There are certain moments in life when one has the possibility to help another, with no profiting from it. How long, with who should it be done? Take this as an example:I tend to be very individualistic at school and I work well by myself. I am finishing my bachelor project and since it is really complicated and I am very good at it some peers that do the same work have asked me for help. I decided to help one and it is a tough job (practically doing his job) because he is a friend (not a close one though), and refused to do the one for another and got angry as well because he was clearly using using me.I don't regreat having done this, because i can be thanked by the friend who I helped for a lifetime since he didn't fail the year. But this has put me in position of thinking "I gave 5 hours avay for nothing", and "am I too nice?".I sometimes feel guilty when I don't help others, but I cannot help everyone, especially because I have barely time for myself, and especially if they can get in the way of my work.Where can we draw a line?
