Worried about my husband's forgetfulnessMy husband is only 44 and has short term memory loss that is severe- I am thinking it's the metformin- but could just be the diabetes.. You don't have to be over 50 to have forgetfulness- sometimes its not age related even when you are older- it can be a symptom of something else- the doctors are baffled and still trying to figure out whats going on- his started about 6 months ago and is worse- his is accompanied with episodes of childlike behavior- in which he has to be reprimanded- he doesn't get upset when i do this he actually listens- i have to remind him to behave - it's like he is 6 yrs old.. but he will forget by the time we get home that he acted like that.
