  Just me who thought university would be a lot more serious?by -InfluenzaI haven't been a party/drinking person before I came here, but I've been surrounded by students who are just out every night. I know that's the thing about uni, but I was expecting it to be more serious, like where people would be hard working non stop like med students, but even the med students I know are always partying or leaving work til late.It doesn't bother me too much because you've got to have fun, but I have that hard work ethic and like to be studying. Even the library/learning commons type buildings we have are very relaxed and not very work motivating.I do enjoy it all but wasn't expecting it to be this laid back.
