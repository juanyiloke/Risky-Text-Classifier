Neurosurgeon appt this am!After being told I would have to wait FOUR months for appt at Kings College Hospital in London = yesterday I had a phone call. If I wanted to there was an appt available privately at Shirley Oaks ( near Croydon, surrey) or Thursday in Harley Street as the consultant who was seeing me in July is on 2 weeks holiday. Cost £250 to get in 18 weeks early with op still on NHS. Decided definitely worth it especially when a search showed the man is leading spinal surgeon in country pioneering endoscopic surgery. Now the butterflies really do start - what have they seen/discovered that makes it so urgent? I have been told locally spinal decompression on at least two vertebrae plus possible fusion with spinal stenosis as well. Methinks my blood sugars are on the rise!!
