Prescription exemption cardsIs your perscription exemption card up to date? As a diabetic you are usually exempt from paying perscription charges. The NHS has finally got around to auditing patients who tick boxes on the back of perscriptions, and are currently checking about 10% of scripts against either their own data or requesting data from other sources such as the DWP.It's a quick process, get a form from your GP's and they will send it off for you. The cards last 5 years and YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR A PENALTY PAYMENT if your card has expired. Best to check your card, if you can't find it and are unsure then the safest bet is to fill the form in and get another one. At least that way you can at least argue you tried to do the right thing.
