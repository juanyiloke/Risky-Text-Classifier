What Newspapers/Magazines do you read?Just curious to know which newspapers are more commonly read by women in Ireland, I always see more men buying them than women, is this an accurate observation? Also, what is your favorite must have magazines? Do you go for the weekly reads such as "Chat" or the glossy gossip "OK' type or maybe specific ones such as the Economist or Business Plus, History of Ireland?For me, I like the Herald its an easy quick read that doesn't challenge my brain cells too much after a long day, On Sunday I like to read the Sunday indo, maybe the Sunday times for good quality reads when I have the time to chill. Magazine-wise I love a weekly chat or take -a-break to read while trying to go asleep but also like Focus, Psychology Today and Zest for fitness tips.
