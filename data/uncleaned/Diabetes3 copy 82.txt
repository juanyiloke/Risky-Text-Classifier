Low IronThis morning I saw a GP after she called, asking to see me at the surgery. She said that my recent blood tests have shown that I have low platelets and the lowest iron level she has seen at 0.6, she said it should be 30+. I have been prescribed ferrous sulphate and ascorbic acid to try to get the iron absorbed into me quicker. Have to have a blood test in a month to check the platelet levels and in 3 months to check the iron. There is no real explanation as to why my levels are so low, they were normal in January. The only thing she can think of is that my stomach is not absorbing properly so she has put me back on domperidone too. My DSN keeps saying my stomach doesn’t work properly and now this has happened but the tests I had for motility were normal. She said I’m a medical mystery, great eh! GP said this could account for the palpitations and light-headedness I’ve been experiencing – which my assigned GP put me on beta blockers for!
