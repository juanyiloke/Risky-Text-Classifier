Help! Burnout! Really stressedhi allLooking for advice work / health wise. We recently lost a headcount in our team and I've taken on a lot more work. My boss didn't work it all out properly and I'm trying to fit a 60 hour job into 37 hours. I'm doing about a 50 hour week and still not finishing work. I'm getting really stressed and missing meals, or just grabbing chocolate. I can't relax, my BG has gone to crap and I feel pants. Can't take holiday either as no one to cover. I feel like I cant cope with it all and my health is really suffering. Any advice??
