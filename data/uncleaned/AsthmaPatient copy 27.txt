I've quit smoking!!  5  Well I'm 21, coming 22.Quit smoking after doing it for 6 years and 2 months!  Last cigarette 52 hours ago and I'm NOT going back!! I've been using the eCig - they're brilliant.But I'm so worried - could my asthma have progressed into COPD?! Sometimes when walking vigorously, I get tight chested, but it goes away by itself.. I think I've always had that?My lung capacity hasn't changed (yes, I actually measured it all those years ago when I started).  Reading about COPD is what made me give up.  Basically, is smoking for 6 years long enough to change my asthma into COPD? * Smoked 10-15 a day for first 2-3 years, then 20 a day the past 3 years roughly* Used reliever inhaler 2x per day during that time* Since stopping smoking, I've only used my reliever in the morning* Have a very dry cough with tiny amounts of phlegm - when smoking had more phlegm!HELP!
