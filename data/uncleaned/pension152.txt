Advice for a young one?This may seem a little bit random as I am not a pensioner, nor am I from the UK. I am nineteen and from Ireland. The thing is, when I wake up in the morning, I can sometimes come up with a creative idea or strange thought, what with still being in a semi-dream like state and that.Anyway, this morning I thought that I should find some of the older folks of this world and ask for some advice about things in general, life and that, considering that no other group in the world really has as much knowledge and experience of things as you people.ÊSo my question is, and I don't mean to be nosy or anything, what advice or words of wisdom would you give to somebody my age who hasn't that much experience and is just stepping into world now (I'm in university at the moment). What have you experienced that would influence your actions if you were to find yourself returned to your physical youth?Thank you,Joseph.
