Hair Going Again¥	Hello¥	I finished chemo 8 weeks ago and rads 2 weeks ago. My hair started to make a show after the 5th chemo of 6.¥	The regrowth reached the fluffy stage and was growing very slowly. Then all of a sudden in past few days it appear to have a spurt which I was happier with.¥	Today I have a shower as usual and washed my hair in simple shampoo l but definitely don't have as much hair as yesterday. My husband agrees.¥	I am into my second week of Lextrzole  aromatose inhibitors which I have been coping well with but what has happened to my hair.¥	Is this normal? Was it the fluffy stuff coming or something to do with the letrozole? Or something else?¥	Cant believe after all I have been through that I am panicking about this.¥	Any thoughts would be appreciated¥	Thank you¥	Cathy
