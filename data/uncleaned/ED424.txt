ÊWorried about upcoming doctor appointmentSo about 3 months ago when I started at my new clinic my doctor weighed me and my weight was more than I knew, which scared the living daylights out of me. Being that much is a huge fear of mine. So he prescribed me metformin for metabolic syndrome (I do not have diabetes) caused by all of the antipsychotics I've been on in the last 3 years. I gained a lot of weight on meds in 2 years, which to me is just unacceptable and so shameful but my old nurse practitioner didn't care to do anything about it. He just kept piling med after med and promising they were weight neutral when they weren't (like risperidone, and zyprexa and seroquel).ÊNow I've lost weight or maybe more I haven't weighed myself in a week in the past two months and my doctor called me because he found out from my pdoc how much weight I've lost and he said that I couldn't possibly have lost it from the metformin and that you're only supposed to lose so much on metformin over the course of several years. So now he's obviously worried that something is wrong especially because I've told him I've been having a side effect of vomiting pretty frequenty unless I eat a whole lot when I take the metformin, but I have no appetite so my meals are very low calories, twice a day, and I usually can't keep one or the other down. I feel fine, not feint or anything. And I'm' really happy about the weightloss, except I feel like a whale still, I'm dtill more than I want to be (I'm 6 feet tall or so, but If I could keep going and be skinnier I would keep goingI'm just scared of what my doctor is going to say. i do have a history of bingeing and purging but my doctor doesn't know that and I haven't done it in forever. I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder and I don't think I have one, just disordered eating. I don't know what to think.
