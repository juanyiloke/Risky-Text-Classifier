My daughter was recently reprimanded at school for name-calling a boy who had been similarly teasing her. It wasn't particularly nasty name & not specific to him in any way. Yet he complained to his Mother who in turn complained to school and she got told off. My daughter (10 )seems to endure a lot of teasing from boys at her school and she regularly has to stick up for herself. She is now feeling very annoyed at being unjustly singled out. I have tried to talk her out of it but she is brooding on it and I can't help agreeing with her. Should I speak to the teacher to put my daughters side of the story? Or just keep encouraging her to ignore it and him? I know teasing is part of growing up but this little horror has moved the goalposts & I want to support my DD.
