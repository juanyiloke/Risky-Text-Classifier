Muscle Cramps - side effect? Side effects HiI use Seretide 250, 2 puffs twice a day.I've been getting really bad cramps for ages now. At first I thought I was dehydrated so I drank lots more, that didn't help, I tried eating bananas, massaging the effected areas regularly (to try and prevent it, not just as a way of easing it) but nothing has helped.This month the pharmacy gave me a different inhaler to the brand I normally have so I read the leaflet to work out how to use it and check there wasn't anything different. I noticed that it listed muscle cramps as a side effect. Does anyone else get cramps? Is there anything I can do to ease it? My fingers and toes are cramping several times a day. Sometimes when I am not even doing anything. I occasionally get it in the back of my leg as well. At times it is really hard to get rid of the cramp and whilst not as bad as having an asthma attack it's really bugging me. :-(Thank you for any help/advice you can offer.
