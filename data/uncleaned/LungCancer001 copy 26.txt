DevastatedHello new guy here 47 years old, husband and father of 3. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 T3 N0 M0 Rectal cancer in Jan 2013. I went thru the chemo radiation and surgery during a 6 month period and I was considered totally NED at the end of my treatments. I thought life was really looking up but during a routine CT Scan and PET Scan last week I found out I have a 1 inch cancerous nodule. I went for a biopsi yesterday and assume I will find out stage and if it has spread to other areas on my dr. visit Friday. The nodule is on my lower lobe on my left lung, I feel fine just a very very very slight wheez when I breath and no fatigue like I had with colon cancer. I find myself being bitter and angry as I honestly thought I had it beat. Any advice??? Thanks Matt
