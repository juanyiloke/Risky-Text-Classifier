Scared and confused HiI'm new to this forum although have observed it for a while. Please can you help me.I am posting tonight as I'm scared and confused. I have had mild asthma for years but over the last year it has become alot more serious with 2 major admissions to hospital in the last year. They are currently trying to wean me off predisalone which I have been struggling with. At the start of this week they told me to cut it down from 30mg -15mg and my asthma has been bad all week I contacted my asthma nurse at the end of the week and she told me to keep on the 15mg over the weekend and she would contact me on Monday to see how it was going. I am now in a situation where my chest is very tight, I'm audibly wheezy and my inhaler is having very little effect. I really don't want to end up in hospital unless absolutely necessary but getting nervous as it seems to be getting worse and Monday seems a long way away. I don't want to cause a fuss or blow things out of proportion but I'm worried.Can anyone offer me advise on what I should do?Many thanks for taking the time to read this.Lindz
