Which uni should I choose?by lydiafoofIn AS year I got BCC. (I am retaking some AS examsOne uni I have applied to wants AAB and its a russell group, another wants ABB and its a non-russell group uni. I have offers from both and am unsure of which one to put at my firm choice. I really wanted to go the the russell group uni but If I miss my grades i'll end up in my insurance choice (and I dont want to go there). The non-russell group uni is more lenient with grades and i know people who have got in with less than ABB.Which uni should I firm?
