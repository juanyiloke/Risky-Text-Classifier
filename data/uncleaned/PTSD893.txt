 Panic faceI need to write a thesis. I feel exhausted all the time. I feel anxious and like I am buzzing all over, this makes it hard to sleep. I have migrainey headaches and really painful eyes, this makes it hard to do anything else. I constantly feel on the verge of flashbacks. I keep getting palpitations. My brain feels fuzzy and it's really hard to think what I need to do or what I've done and to reason through things WHICH I NEED TO DO  I constantly feel on the verge of a panic attack and/or a flashback. If I try to sleep I lie there with my heart racing or get stuck with my body asleep and my mind having flashbacks. I really want to self harm in the hope that it will help me to stay present, calm me down and take away some of the guilt for not doing enough work. But I have promised that I will talk to Katie before I do and I can't justify it unless I'm feeling desperate. I am, but I don't think she'll understand because there is something I can do about it ie work. I have bought a load of lucozade and relentless to do work but this might just string me out even more. On the other hand when I've got more done I might feel better? :|I feel so lost and scared
