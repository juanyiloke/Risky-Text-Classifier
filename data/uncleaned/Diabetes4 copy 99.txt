Meters, Built in obsolesence = progress ?Ç on: 06 October 2014, 05:04:47 PM ÈA couple or three years ago, my practice decided to rationalize on the types of sticks/meters they offered, probably to help contain costs etc. So they told me the ones I had the choice of using & I picked the Abbott "Freestyle Lite" as it more or less seemed to fill my requirements from those available. I asked for & got 2. Over the last w/end BOTH of them died on me & one had a LOT more use than the other, tried new batteries + all sorts to no avail so rang for replacements (at least twice) & picked up a new "Lite" machine this afternoon. Am seriously unimpressed with it, physically awkward to hold as amongst other things it's to thin. The strips, which are now individually wrapped are difficult to access, especially with cold & wet hands (when I go fishing), still this is probably a cost saving to Abbott. They only now take blood (& more is needed) from one direction, instead of two - which was a major factor in choosing its predecessor in the first place, not to mention an over-complex set-up procedure (to put it VERY mildly !). I don't like so called ""smart phones" & it looks like I now have a "smart (*****) meter". Sorry if I sound like a non-techno person, but I can manage by myself a LOT better, than any   textbook driven meter. Rant over.
