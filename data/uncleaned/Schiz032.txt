What was your first psychotic episode like?by superanonymous » Fri Apr 29, 2011 5:47 pmHi Everyone,I'm new here and have a child with Psychotic Disorder-NOS. I've decided to use my creative outlets to write a fictional story about psychosis in an effort to work through my own issues in caregiving and also to bring about more awareness and understanding.I was wondering if any of you would be willing to describe the first time you had a psychotic episode. How old were you? What happened? What were the events/feelings leading up to it? How did it resolve?My only experience with psychosis has been with my son, and I'd like to get a better understanding of what it's like for others.Thank you!
