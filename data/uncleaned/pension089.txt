Feeling downFirst and foremost I'm not elderly, yet, I'm only 20 but I'm feel you may be the best people to ell me. Since the age of 17 I've been going bald and have become anxious and paranoid, and have seen many medical reports etc that balding is linked to heart diesease and the younger and severe the balding the more likely and serious heart problems can be. Basically my question here is did you, or people you know go bald that young, and have lived long and healthy lives? I understand health issues can effect anyone and anyone but I need to prove a point to myself and put My mind at rest. I hope I haven't wasted your time and I hope this is the right section etc. Many thanks and all the best.
