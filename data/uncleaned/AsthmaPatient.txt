New user of Fostair I am a 72 year old woman, a life long asthmatic and have had COPD for the last 15 years. I have not smoked for the past 40 years. I have been using Ventolin (Salbutamol); Atrovent and a small dose of Q Var daily.These have gradually become less effective. Recently I was prescribed Fostair, (beclamethasone/formeterol) as an inhaler, which I understand is fairly new. This seems to be very effective, but the Consultant told me to use a spacer - in fact I was given a new one with my prescription. However, it states clearly on the side of the Fostair packet, \&quot;Not to be used with a spacer\&quot;. It appears that Fostair has not been tested using a spacer. At present I am using just the inhaler without a spacer. This is a little confusing. Also, I was told by the pharmacist that there is no need to refrigerate this drug once usage has begun. However, on the instructions it states, \&quot;Store in a refrigerator\&quot;, which is what I am doing at the moment.I already have Essential Tremor, (an inherited condition), which means my hands shake. Fostair seems to have made this slightly worse, but I was warned about it. Is anyone else using Fostair inhaler? If so, what are your thoughts?Good wishes to all.
