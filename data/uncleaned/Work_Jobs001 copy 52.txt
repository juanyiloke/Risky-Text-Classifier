Company Closing________________________________________I don't want to give to much personal info at this stage...My employer is winding down the business over the next 12 months. There will be several rounds of redundancies over the 12 months until everybody has been laid off. My job is different to everybody else and I am the only one doing this job and I have learned that he wants to lay me off first then immediately re-employ me on a contract basis, until final closure, at half my existing salary.Wondering, first of all, if it's ok for him to do this?
