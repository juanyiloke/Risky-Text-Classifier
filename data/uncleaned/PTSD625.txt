Found my Gran dead after 3 days,Posted 11 months agoAs simple as that. I coped well, then started feeling i couldn't face people at work, so hid in the office. Then bought diazepam illegally of the web, and typically ended up over doing it taking 60+mg a day. Ended up with no job-but stil have vivid flashbacks to my gran laying there. I'm under official docs help now, but keep using semi-legal drugs, and not enough money for bills. i'm sure i'll come through it, but not many understand and feel alone with my problems...though i'm sure i'm not! Thanks for reading x
