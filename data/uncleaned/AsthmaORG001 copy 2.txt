Pnemonia I do not do it in halves. I got a cold and 5 days later I have pneumonia. Got the works antibiotics that give diahorrea, prednisone 40mg, saline nebs and salbutamol 2.5mg nebs. Plus the rest of normal meds. I am back to square one. Breathless in everything and respiratory nurse ringing me daily.Will have to start rehabilitation all over again.I hate it how you achieve lots then end up back to start.It like a real life version of snakes and ladders.Anyone else slide down a snake due to an infection recently?
