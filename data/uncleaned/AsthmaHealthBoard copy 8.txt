Flutiform versus Seretide________________________________________My asthma has been well controlled for many years with Seretide inhaler (plus Ventolin for very occasional acute symptoms). Now I've been changed to Flutiform inhaler. Everything's changed in the ten days that I've been using it. I frequently struggle for breath after climbing stairs, have a dry cough that wakes me in the night and am immediately wheezy in the presence of dogs (whereas the wheeziness would build up slowly over several days in the past.) My mouth and tongue are also sore and dry, even though I rinse out and gargle after using the inhaler.Worst of all, my PVC's (ectopic heart beats) are much worse now and my blood pressure, which was quite satisfactory (range 118/68 - 132/82) is now up around 140/90 these last two days. These latter symptoms may be because I'm having to take Ventolin several times a day now, whereas with Seretide I used to have only one puff of Ventolin each morning (usually my worst time) before taking the Seretide. Has anybody else had experience of being changed to Flutiform? I read somewhere it was supposed to be the new wonder drug but it doesn't seem to suit me.
