Did you believe this lie?Ok forget the title for a minute.Think of this. We have all heard the mantra ..don't depend on a man. Never depend on a man Never depend on a man. But have some of us taken that up as men are not dependable? Or could it be taken up as that?I know that perhaps the message really means get your education and don't USE men. I want women to be the best women they can be and be empowered etc. But it's about 'Taking it away from the boys'. It kind of denies their contribution in life and society.ÊI watched a video and it set me thinking.If you start off with the idea that someone is not dependable from the get go or untrustworthy it sort of means you will accept that as the status quo.And if you really believe men are not dependable or and think all people are like that it kind of preempts any relationship working.I know it's possibly not what the message was intended to be but is that what we are subconsciously telling ourselves and others.ÊShould you not actually be seeking friends and partners that are dependable?
