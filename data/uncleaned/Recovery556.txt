  It's funny how the little things can make you feel better...On average I get one day off for every 4/5 days of work . Today was my day off.I got up at 9:30 (despite not getting in from work until after midnight) and went grocery shopping. I came home did a few loads of laundry and then ironed some shirts. I did the washing up and cooked dinner. After that I hoovered. Then I returned to the shops to pick up a few things I'd forgottenin the morning .It was gone 5pm before I'd finished my chores for the day.Normally I'd spend my day off watching TV, playing video games, hitting the refresh button to see if anything interesting had been posted online, etc.. But despite spending most of my day doing chores around the house I feel far better than if I had just lounged around the place and relaxed. It's remarkable how much of a difference this activity  has made to my day. It feels great  That's all I wanted to say. Thanks for reading
