I am 25 years old and I was raped in January 2009. I was also sexually assaulted in 2008 as well as being abused physically and verbally as a child. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I have been trying to find help since that happened but didn't have much luck until late last year. Because of the attack I had to leave school and come home. I have been living with my grandfather since I cae home. Last year I hit an all time low and started passing out, having more panic attacks, becoming physically ill, and having more difficulty than usual so I checked myself into an inpatient facility. They referred me to some places but my vehicle broke down and I haven't been able to get it fixed because I do not have the money. I have tried to work, but I freak out when I'm in public and I don't even go outside of my house often. I feel like I am getting worse and I feel all alone. I feel like crying all of the time and I worry about things that I know is irrational. I just don't want to feel so alone and it seems like no one cares.
