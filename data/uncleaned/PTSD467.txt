ÊMy Story, continued.As previously stated, I suffer from depression/ anxiety disorder. To make matters more difficult, I have recently ended a 6 year relationship wirh a man who was diagnosed with advanced narcissistic personality disorder and clinically diiagnosed with sex addiction.I had no choice but to end the relationship; I felt cornered, harrassed, and victimized.ÊHonestly, I dont feel that I am doing well after all of this. The feelings of anger, despair, and lonliness haunt me every day. I have severe trust issues with people, and fear getting too close due to danger of heartbreak again. I can't even cry anymore; i've not shed a tear in months. I go straight to cold, malicious anger. Then I isolate myself and hole up at home until I can seem to feel something other than anger or depression. I don't want to let this ruin me and my life. I do have an appointment with a local therapist, but I'm just trying to be "ok" until then. Just wish that I could decompress, and get some help. Just don't know where to begin with any of this. My mind is a blur, and my heart feels like it's missing.
