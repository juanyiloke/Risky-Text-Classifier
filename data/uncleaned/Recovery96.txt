I'm Taking A Snapshot Of This Time In My LifeI'm taking a snapshot of this time in my life. Because for 5 months I've been taking the BDI scale on a (sort of) weekly basis and my results have been sliding back and forth between moderate and severe depression. I didn't think that would (or could) change because each statement as far as I was concerned weren't really a measurement of my mind but rather a measurement of life in general. I hadhopeless answers to all of the questions. ¥	Are other people better than me?Yes - and treatment can't change that.¥	Have I failed more than other people?Of course I have. Treatment won't change that either. I felt they were true. Every single bad thing I thought about myself and my life was the truth. And there was no changing that! So  as far as I was concerned, if my BDI came back as moderate, I was doing well (at least it weren't severe). Then almost 6 weeks ago, I started a new treatment program; TLC - Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (by Dr Steve Ilardi) which made me make changes in my lifestyle; omega 3 supplementation, social activity, sleep scheduling, ruminative control, sunlight exposure and physical exercise. I stopped using BDI and began to use the TLC Depression Scale instead as a way of recording my progress. Each week I see an improvement, and this week when I took the TLC test, I noticed a 40% drop in my depression scores compared to 4 weeks ago.40% decrease..?I couldn't believe its accuracy so it occurred to me to check in with good old BDI. And I did.And I have actually scored as having a mild mood disturbance.I've never scored so well.So I'm taking a snapshot. And here it is. All those things I thought about myself (and sometimes still feel) aren't really true.Things can get better. My mind lies to me. After years of battling, all it took was a little over a month of the right therapy to change my mind :)
