Diabetes shop?Hi folks,Has anybody on here had dealings with diabetes shop uk? Reason I ask, I ordered and paid for an item from there on 4th Nov... I'm still waiting for it to be delivered despite paying exorbitant cost of £4.95 (for a measly 1oz item?   ) I emailed to ask where my package is but received no reply so I've just now sent another email. If i don't get a reply I'll just take up the matter with PayPal.The webpage is very amateurish in its layout and delving around the various pages I found something that had I seen earlier I would have skipped ordering from the site!Is it me or does the blurb under the heading "you should try and eat" sound contradictory?Oh.... and stay well clear of "all fatty food" I bet a lot of you wise peeps have heard that one before <sigh>http://www.diabeticshop.co.uk/healthy%20eating.htmlcheers    Tony
