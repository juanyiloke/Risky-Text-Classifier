training grant________________________________________I have received a training grant from my employer. We both signed a form agreeing that I would pay it back if I left within x period. The course costs more than a months salary. If I give my months notice, I would suspect that the salary will be stopped. How is the rest of it paid? if I decide not to pay it, what avenue would be taken to pursue it?And how legal is that piece of paper? both parties signed it at the time.obviously I want to avoid loosing a months salary if possible!
