UnsureHi I'm very new to neda. I have had family recently come to me and brought up that I may have bulimia. I started crying. I always thought it was like anorexia. Then I did research.I have had low self esteem issues since I was young. I depend on food no matter what. I don't purger per day by vomiting but I will work out a lot. I feel terribly guilty for eating period. I am not that heavy but I feel huge. that's the way I see myself also.I guess I'm just lost on what to do or how to go about getting help. I just want to be skinny. None of my clothes fit me. I refuse to go in public cause of how big I feel. Please help me. I just don't have to many supporters just a few
