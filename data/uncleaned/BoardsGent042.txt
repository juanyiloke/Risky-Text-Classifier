Anton Savage Show: Girlfriend Pregnant, Boyfriend wants AbortionWas listening this morning to the Anton Savage show on Today FM.Anton and his research team produced a letter from some un-named man who was living abroad with his Girfriend. He was 32 she was 27, neither has children. But she previously had an abortion and it was tough on her. It didn't say how long they were going out for.ÊThe Scenario was as follows.She was 6 weeks pregnant and wanted to go ahead and have the baby. It wasn't mentioned if that would entail coming back to Ireland or not or having the baby abroad. For various reasons, (They are abroad, she is out of work, they live in rented accommodation) He didn't want to go ahead with having the baby and was about to ask her to have an abortion again. He wanted the opinion of the great un-washed who listen to the radio at 9am in the morning .... :-/As you can imagine the responses to the article were pretty emotive. Mostly along the lines of : you heartless b****** how could you not be fully supportive of your GF regardless of her decision, its a woman right to choose etc..... to the occasional response of : well actually you will be paying the bills, so you should certainly have some say in this decision.I think a lot more men get into this situation than they will ever admit to.Anybody listening to this show this morning or have an opinon in general ?ÊI have my own opinion which I will post shortly.
