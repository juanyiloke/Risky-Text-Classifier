Not sure what I'm feeling :(Hi all,I an new to the forums and am looking for advice. My wife has pointed me to the website and would like to share how I am feeling. I am not sure if I am depressed or not.I am married with 3 kids, a decent job which doesn't cause me any stress and am financially stable. However, I do not care about anything at the moment. Family, friends and my job. Nothing in my life excites me or makes me happy. i am angry all the time and yell at my wife and kids whenever I talk to them. The smallest thing will set me off. I'm drinking more than I should to probably numb my existence and this in turn causes massive issues in all my relationships. I have no close friends due to being grumpy and this in turn makes me sadder than ever. I have been to the doctors and been prescribed pills but they made me feel more distant so I don't want to do that again. I feel guilty over the things I've done in my life that has hurt others. This guilt is tearing me apart. There is more but that's all I want to get off my chest for now.any advice or pointers would be great.
