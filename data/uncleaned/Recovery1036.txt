First happy day in 7 monthsWensday was awesome had my kids all day no supervised visit.We came to some agreements at our mediation on tues now just getting kids used to coming around my place again and then look at 50% again.I still have alot of work to do on myself yet im seeing a little hole with some hope within it.I even got an application form to apply for a job yesterday.Love my kids and we had a ball was sad when they left and my kids wanted to stay too made me feel really good.I just want this depresssion to piss off and the anxiety.
