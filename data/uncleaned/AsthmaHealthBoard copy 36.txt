understanding IgE levels and Xolair________________________________________Hi, I am hoping to find some assistance here to help my father, he is 82 and has a chronic asthma problem. He has been on steroids, albuterol, a nebulizer etc etc, and the continuous use of steroids is having a terrible impact on his health. I am trying to understand if we just need a new physician, or if there is something more we can do to lower his IgE levels.After pushing his pulmonologist if there is ANYTHING to be used besides steroids at this point (they are needed more and more frequently now), he finally mentioned Xolair. But he said my father's IgE levels were too high to use Xolair right now (they came in at 629 IU/ml), and the desired "normal" reference range is 0-100.After doing a lot of research myself, it seems that some people with EXTREMELY higher levels of IgE levels (some into the 10's of thousands) were able to get on Xolair, and I believe this is what my father desperately needs.Does this number 629 actually calculate HIGHER? Not sure what the IU/ml is in relation to all the people I have read mention on forums, many people wrote about having 30,000 / 52,000 / 70,000 / ... numbers REALLY high like that. Also, I asked his physician what could be done to lower IgE levels to be able to get on it, and he said "nothing"! Then through my own research I found a physician that said taking NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) along with Vitamin C will help, the NAC directly blocks IL-4, which is the main factor in producing IgE antibodies.Anyone have experience or knowledge on what your levels have to be to take Xolair? Anyone have a recommendation of a good pulmonologist in the Houston area? Many thanks!
