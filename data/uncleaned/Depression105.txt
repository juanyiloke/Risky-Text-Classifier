Feelin' terrible I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but for the past two weeks I've spiralled with both ups and downs. After my doctor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, I figured it would all get better. I called a therapist and everything seemed to be going well, except she never got back to me.Then, I had my first panic attack; I started breathing really heavily and crying and I couldn't stop. I knew it was because of my work placemet at the residential home (which is a part of my six form course) and I didn't go in after that because I just couldn't face it.Most days, I feel absolutely terrible; I have this unsetling feeling of sadnes that seems to always course through me. And slowly, i've been feeling worse to an extent that terrified me.I haven't told anybody about the GP and what i've been diagnosed with. I have nobody to talk to and I feel so helpless. I have no idea what to do.I feel like i'm going to be consumed by everything ..
