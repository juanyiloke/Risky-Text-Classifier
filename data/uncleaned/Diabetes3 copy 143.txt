So scared.Hello everyonefirstly I am sorry to hardly ever post then when I do it is to moan, but I am so scared at the moment and nobody seems to care.Last September I noticed that when I went walking with my 75 year old mother, who is riddled with osteoporosis, I could not keep up with her because I was getting breathless. I did not take much notice until the beginning of January ( this year ) when I felt like I had a wide tight band around my ribcage. Shortly after this the shortness of breath got worse and worse, so I went to see my G.P. I was diagnosed with having an allergy and prescribed antihistamines and a nasal spray. That did not work so I made another appointment with the doctor ( had to wait another 4 weeks ). This time the doctor said maybe it was asthma and gave me a ventolin inhaler. This still did not help so, after another 3 week wait I went back and was given a steroid preventative inhaler. Again nothing worked so I had a lung function test to check for Asthma. That was negative, so next I had blood test for thyroid anaemia and others, just got results back and again everything was negative. I am now so breathless I can't do anything without getting out of breath, not even make a cup of tea or hold a conversation. The tight feeling around my ribs is getting tighter but the doctors don't seem to be worried I have another appointment in the morning but just do not seem to be getting anywhere. I am a huge worrier at the best of times, but I am just so frightened now. I am scared it might be my heart and I will die before they can diagnose it. I am scared I have lung cancer and will die. Nobody ( hubby and family ) seem to care. My head is telling me that I am going to die so I might as well take a load od tablets and get it over with now.I am so sorry for bothering you all, and about the long post. I know only a doctor can diagnose me, but I am just so frightened and alone.Thanks for reading this.
