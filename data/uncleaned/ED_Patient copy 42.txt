I have MS but the problem I have ms has been ruled out18 months Ago I started losing weight and found it difficult to eat,I had the magic eye and was found to have a ulcer at the bottom of the tube,they believed it could be sinster,many months down the line various treatmentsand investigations they found I was producing excess acid,but even though I do not have cancer,I am stll suffering from extreme pain and am scared of eating as the pain goes around to the back.I have been going to gp and she has given me morphine,but in doing this all my ms drugs I cant take so have double pain  Has anyone else had something similarjacquie
