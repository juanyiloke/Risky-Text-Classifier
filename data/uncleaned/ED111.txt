StuckHello everyone. I just joined this website today and I feel like I need to talk about what's been going on somewhere. I am just now finally realizing that my little "food issue" is actually an eating disorder. Today has been a very very rough day. I feel so stuck. I know that I need to tell someone and get help, yet I am so so terrified of what will happen if I do. I'm scared that I'll be forced to eat and I'll gain weight, which will only make me feel worse, which might only make my ED worse. But i can't stand feeling like this any longer. I can't eat anything. The other night my mom decided to cook bacon to go with dinner and I started crying because I didn't know how I could eat it without going over the calories I had limited myself to. I haven't been struggling like this for very long, and part of me really wants to keep going and prove to myself that I am strong enough to do this. But I'm scared of what will happen when I do. I'm scared that I'll get sick enough to permanently damage my health. I'm scared that I'll drive myself over the edge. I know that I need to tell someone, but I'm not sure how to do it or what to say or what will happen. I'm thinking about talking to my mom tonight.I'm not sure how much weight I have lost, which only drives me further. I'm worried that I haven't even accomplished anything with this and that I'm giving up to soon. Does anyone else ever feel like this? But I'm sick of always feeling like I'm dying and I'm sick of the emotional distress this is causing me and I'm sick of being sick.Does anyone have any advice for finally speaking up about having an ED to your parents? I just don't know what to say at this point. I feel like a mess. I don't think I've thoroughly expressed how low I have hit today. This might be rock bottom.Thank you for any advice and supportxx
