NeedlesWhile I was replying to Mike's message about the Freestyle Libra I commented about my father's fear of needles. It's so bad that we can't even mention the word in his presence, he just goes a weird shade of white and faints. How he injects his insulin is a miracle although it is a major event with a great deal of preparation, a process that can take 20 or 30 minutes. Even his measuring of BG only happens once a day. I don't make any judgements because he's my dad and I used to be similar, except I became a blood donor many years ago, to overcome the fear. Worked very well too, that lack or fear has served me well.My question is "How many people have a fear of needles and is there anything that can be done to overcome that fear". Any hints, tips, advice appreciated. I did try the "become a blood donor" many years ago, I thought I was going to have to pick him up off the floor. He has also tried hypnosis but unfortunately he went into it thinking that it worked like he'd seen it on TV, where the subject goes out like a light, the hypnotist plants a thought, then wakes the subject up cured. Sadly, it doesn't work like that.
