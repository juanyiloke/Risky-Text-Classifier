inpatientHello all. I had a dream last nite, one of those dreams where you wake up, fall asleep and the dream continues on...it was that i was inpatient @ an eating disoder hospital. & in the dream I felt so much fear. I was terrified of giving up my control, my habits, my comfort, my normality. It was just so very real.....Now im wondering from all of you who know, what is inpatient like? I am sure it is different for everyone.I wonder if this dream will ever come to life.
