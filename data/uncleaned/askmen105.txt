Need Advice - Working in China2012-08-13, 09:51 AMHi, this is my first post. I need some advice on my career move. I recently graduated from my University last year with a degree in Business Administration. From there I worked at a College teaching English in China for a year. I did some traveling and picked up a good amount of Mandarin Chinese. I'm back in America now considering what to do next. I could go back there for a year and learn more language/find a better job maybe. I could also just stay here and find a job. I don't own a car right now and am living with my parents. Not exactly sure what I want to do in the future but i'd like to be in International Affairs.Any opinions would be helpful as long as they are constructive.Regards,Randy
