Feel like I've gone back to square one Hi I've suffered from depression since I was 17, but it used to be mild enough for me to cope with alone.Seven weeks ago, with no apparent cause, I completely lost control and slipped into severe depression. After encouragement from my partner, I sought help from my GP who started me on Sertraline.The last few weeks have been tough, but over the past week I started to feel much better. I'm now on 100mg Sertraline, awaiting counselling and practising mindfulness.That was until today, when I went back to work on phased return. I feel like all the strength I built up just disappeared the second I left home. I spent hours in tears, unable to do anything and ended up going back home. I thought I was ready but I'm clearly not.How do you know when it's the right time? Will I ever feel normal again or is this it now?
