I'm just sick of life and everyone in it. Every time I try to bring up how I'm feeling to my parents, they shrug it off as adolescence. I once told my mom that I was feeling really sad all the time, and I was concerned because I thought I might have depression. (Not 100% or anything, never been diagnosed but I can relate to a lot of symptoms of severe depression). The next day, I was able to make a joke with her about something and she got all pissed and was like,"Why do you bother wasting my time with this stuff? You surely don't seem depressed TODAY.." and it really upset me. I just can't talk to anybody about how I feel. I'm bullied at school and the kids in my grade are all fake or just plain ****. There's no one I can relate to anymore. I give up. Constantly, suicidal thoughts are popping up in my head and getting more and more frequent. Recently, I've started lightly cutting my left arm with my fingernails. Not deep enough to bleed, but I still get little scratch marks. It just helps me feel again. I just need someone to talk to. Reply if you would like.Thanks.
