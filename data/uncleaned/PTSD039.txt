Addicted To The Adrenaline Of It All..Hello all! So I'm still very early on into my treatment but I've spent a lot of time over the past few weeks reflecting on my life with PTSD and how its changed me as a person. They say that people with PTSD can get addicted to the adrenaline rush they experience with their traumas..and looking back on my years with PTSD, I am beginning to wonder whether or not I am addicted to the adrenaline rush. For the past 10 years, my life has centered around searching for the ultimate adrenaline rush, whether it be with drugs, sex, reckless overindulgence, risk taking behavior or just the complete abandonment all together of any self preservation or self worth I may have. Although my life is in a better place than in previous years, I feel like I need chaos to feel normal. Am I the only one?!
