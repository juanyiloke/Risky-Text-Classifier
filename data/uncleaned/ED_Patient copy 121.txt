Excuses, excuses!For anyone who has had an eating disorder, excuses play a big role. You need excuses why you don't want to eat. You need excuses why you are exercising more than usual. You pretty much need an excuse for anything you do. This was the hardest part for me.I'm a very honest person and I hate lying, especially to the people I love. But in order to hide my eating disorder (ednos, progressed to anorexia) I had to lie and make excuses. I told my mother I wanted to exercise to keep in shape but I would say things like \&quot;I'll have to eat more at supper to make up for losing so many calories\&quot; and things like that. And to my boyfriend.. it was the hardest to lie to him. If he asked me if I had eaten I would want to say \&quot;yes, yes\&quot; just so he wouldn't worry but I never could lie to him and I would always say no.. I still have the eating disorder (was hospitalized but relapsed) and I'm worried that I'm going to start lying to my boyfriend and to do that would break my heart..Has anyone else felt the need to make excuses and then feel guilty about lying? I hate hurting the people that I love but I can't get better.. maybe I could get better but deep down I don't really know if I want to..
