Feeling tired and run downHi everyone,I have had 2 Hb1a tests, one in October 2014 and then again in February this year. On both tests I scored 48 which i know is the cut off line for T2. When I got the results of the first test my GP said they would repeat the test and if the level hadn't fallen would look at prescribing meds. Now she is saying test again in 4 months and see if there is any change. In the mean time I'm left feeling continually exhausted and run down. Any advice please????
