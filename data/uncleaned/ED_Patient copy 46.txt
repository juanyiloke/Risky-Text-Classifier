Pre meal planBecause I've been eating either nothing or very little for some time , my care team have got in touch with the eating disorders team and I've been put on a "pre meal plan" which basically works out at about 900 calories including fluids (mainly milk) . I'm already trying to cheat my way out of it , by reducing what I can hear and there and the milk was the first thing to go I was wondering if any of you know something high in calcium etc (like milk) but low in calories I could try if such thing exists .I managed to stick to it for one day and now I'm off on a long walk (which I've been told to cut down on as well) it's like they try to take all control off the bat and that just isn't guna work with me Thanks
