Which Uni should I go for masters? (Intl. Relations/Studies)by yJangHi guysI got admitted both in Durham and Leiden University for Intl. Studies and I'm waiting for the decisions from St. Andrews and Sciences Po. Paris (Dual degree program with LSE).I'm a residence outside of EU nor UK and reason why I study Intl. Studies is to work for Intl. organisations. Of course it would be amazing if I can get the Sciences Po. , which was my dream program, but if I fail to have that opportunity, where should I go?Leiden in the Netherlands? or Durham in the UK?
