Hi Everyone, I'm Ashlee and this is my first time posting on here as I'm usually on the CVID board, but I've been noticing changes in my asthma attacks and was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Before when I had an attack, it seemed gradual and I had time to get to my nebulizer at home or my inhaler if I was out and about. Here lately, I've been having attacks that give me very little time to get to my rescue medication. Because I become so faint so quickly, I worry that while walking around trying to get to my nebulizer, I will faint and hurt myself when I fall. These attacks come on suddenly and are much worse. I start having chest pain and shortness of breath and within a couple of minutes, my hands are blue and I'm about to faint. I'm sure it's my asthma because the Xopenex relieves it and the color returns to my hands. I had a round of prednisone when this happened before and it stopped for a few weeks. I don't want more prednisone because my immune system doesn't work normally as it is and it makes it worse. I'm on Advair 500/50 twice a day and it has helped. I've tried basically everything else and had no results at all. Before the Advair, the discomfort and shortness of breath were constant and now it's much better in general. Before the Advair, there were nights I couldn't even lay down to try to sleep because I couldn't breathe. I'm happy that I feel so much better the rest of the time, but these attacks are scary. I take Advair 500/50 twice a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, and nebulizedXopenex when needed as I also have a heart condition. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is there anything more I can do to prevent it? Thanks so much!
