Radicalisation, how does it happen?My wife and I discuss, often argue, as to how this sort of thing can happen. If children have a happy, stable home and social life, how do they become "radicalised"? I don't understand it! They must have some sort of grievance in their lives to even start along this road and to me the parents are as much to blame as the kids.     And how did they not raise the suspicions of the immigration/passport staff on exit?
