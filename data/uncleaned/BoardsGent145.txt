Fathers raising males today.I’m sure I’m not the only father here raising a boy(s) and after noting some posts here about the general hostility to males in schools and society in general what steps people are taking to at least counteract the feminist propaganda boys (and men) are being exposed to and preparing them for the world as it really is. Everywhere they turn its basically males == deadbeats.One of mine is going into secondary soon, it’s not co-ed, but I guess it’s still time to encourage a healthy attitude to ass-covering when in the company of women. It’s your word against theirs and yours is always wrong.To that end I’ve explained how in my work I try to ensure I’m never left in a position alone with one of the female staff, since if they want to they can easily cost me my job and such like.Correcting them about such notions as chivalry, before you do something for a woman think if you’d do it for a man also and only then do it.The deck is so stacked against the next generation that it makes sense to ensure they know what they’re getting into.Now I’m not suggesting things like MGTOW, which while understandable (perhaps even sensible) are perhaps a step too far at that age.So anyone have tips or suggestions, perhaps I’m overreacting and gone off the deep-end.ps. yes its a first post, we all start somewhere
