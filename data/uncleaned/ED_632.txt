Need help for this situation. UPDATE & QUESTION in recent postThe situation is that i am a university student as are my flatmates. we are signed onto a year long lease which unless we can find a replacement person to take over we are required by law to pay. If we have to move out- we still have to pay rent here as well as new home. One of my flatmates, (whom none of us knew before living together) also has an eating disorder (i do too).Êshes younger then me, her weight has visibly changed, she is exercising and purging. Me- i struggle to eat enough and if it feels to much i too purge (but not often)...im not losing weight as ive struggled with this for 5+ years.ÊMe moving out is not a viable option as i have issues living with people i dont know and financially its not possible. Im pretty certain she cant leave either.Êwe are both under a community mental health team and have gp appointments/support.ÊAside form some general rules- like no numbers or talking about what we've eaten etc. We are struggling separately but together.ÊI need some advice on how i can continue to live with her and not get sicker myself?
