Diabetes and TeethI have read (several different sources) that poorly controlled BG will result in problems with teeth, gums, and tongue because of the presence of glucose in Saliva.I have been very fortunate in that my BG is by and large very well controlled, especially now, but my poor old teeth seem to be having a bad time of it recently with multiple fillings necessary and now a molar has disintegrated (partially down to old fashioned filling now 55 years old). I brush 2 to 3 times a day and also use a wonderful device known as a water pick. Do other members of this forum have problems? Maybe some hints and tips as I'd like to keep my teeth.
