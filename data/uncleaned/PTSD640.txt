I was diagnosed as having PTSD at the beginning of this year 2005. I used to be called out to the so called incidents or the suicides under train wheels. The horror of a human body mutilated by a railway train, this has left me with nightmare out of hell. The flash backs are so vivid and detailed I dread the nights when I put head down to sleep, but over time I learned to put all the horrors into a box way down deep in my memories, but my personal life got involved, my wife-to-be was killed in a road accident.I left the railway and went to work as security guard, and once again the box was opened due a violent robbery, I was threatened with my life and now I can longer shut the box.I asked for help for the first time and the road for help has been so long and now I have reach the end. I have taken four over doses, not so clever, but I have got to a stage were I will be in a hospital very soon, I am one of the lucky ones. I feel desperately alone with (PTSD) I have to go now I am going cry again and that is the worst. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with me, God bless you all.
