Weight Gain.Hey all, Sorry to post, again but I'm really struggling with my weight at the moment.About a month ago I was told I either gained weight or went back into hospital, I chose to gain weight & have successfully done so, but I'm really regretting my decision despite knowing it was the right thing to do. I just feel like I've ballooned && no amount of logic seems to be sinking into my brain, I know I'm still emaciated but that doesn't matter, what matters is that I'm not the weight I was & that's causing my ED to flare into such a rage its threatening to swallow me & I'm certain you can tell I've put on weight & have taken to hiding indoors incase people see me & comment. Everyone seems so happy that I'm more safe & seem to think that I'm OK at this weight & I'm really not. I'm still trying, I'm maintaining my weight now but its such a struggle & I don't know how to fight off this pull downwards again, I feel like everyone has forgotten that it's still hard for me. I'm just feeling hopeless & fat & sad. I want to make my brain better & for it to understand that actually I made the right choice rather than the wrong one,, 'cause its so uncomfortable being this weight & I'm stuck & I don't know what to do.
