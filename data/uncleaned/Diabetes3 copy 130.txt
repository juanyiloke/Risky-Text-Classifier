SugarsI was in M&S on Saturday past. As i was waiting at the checkout they had a stack of hot cross buns as an impulse buy. As something I love I picked a packet intending to have one for lunch. As I stood waiting I happened to read the back of the packet and was horrified to discover 1 hot cross bun had 40g of sugar. 40g. Needless to say I put the packet back. Out of curiosity I then lifted a 100g packet of dark chocolate covered peanuts. The whole packet contained 23g of sugar. I didnt buy them either. Its a minefield out there an absolute minefield. So what do I eat now for a wee treat. The Lord alone knows.__________________You have succeeded in life when all you want is only what you need.
