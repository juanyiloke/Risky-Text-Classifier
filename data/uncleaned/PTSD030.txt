Changing Name & Social Security NumberI'm wondering if anyone here has insights on legally changing their name and Social Security Number for safety reasons. In my state the name change part seems fairly easy, and you don't need quite so much evidence for keeping it unpublished in the papers. You just have to go before a judge. The social security number seems more difficult as you need to supply evidence. Having never reported anything (much goes back years) I only have a few more recent voicemails to present, and probably a few letters of support. If anyone has done this I'd love to know how it went.Thanks!
