 Manchester vs St. Andrewsby eatingcrispsHello!So above are my two offers; the deadline is impeding and I need to make a choice but I am utterly clueless. For reasons I'd rather not share I couldn't visit either university and so will (unfortunately) be basing my decision on what I can find online and in prospectuses. To cut it short:Studying: Anthropology and Philosophy (combined honours, entry sept 2016)Offer: conditional AAB from bothUndecided because:- - I don't know which is the best student life - obviously they are both extremely different universities in almost many aspects, but I don't know if a busy city student life (Manc) is a better experience than some where remote and gorgeously scenic (St A)?- I like going out and drinking and often do that with friends at home right now.. I am fully aware St A can't offer that to me, will I feel suffocated?- I don't know if a smaller university (St A) would be more intimate and have a better community feel?- I genuinely cannot tell which is the better university of the two in terms of academics what with Manchester seeming better globally and St A better nationally?- St A has such a large intake from independent schools; the stereotype that comes with that intimidates me; I've been to comprehensives my whole life and I would be really worried about fitting in. I know this is really difficult to respond to as choosing university is such a personal thing, so I understand that it's difficult for anybody on TSR to really help me out - I'm just panicking so any advice at all would be really really valued! Thank you
