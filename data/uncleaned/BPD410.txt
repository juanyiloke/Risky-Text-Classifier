ÊPossible bpd ?Hi I have been battling through mental health issues for past year and half and I have always tried to find what's "wrong" with me now I am afraid to go to a psychiatrist as they f**k around with meds. I was diagnosed with ptsd but I don't exactly think that's "it" I have been looking into the bipolar disorder I wasn't sure it was it so done a couple of months of research and came to a decision that it is not the case now I'm looking in bpd and I find It applies to me can someone help as to wether or not I need to see a psychologist or psychiatrist for diagnosis ?? I am hoping just a psychologist will do I'm a 20 year old male fyi and have previous threads in here
