Any tips for swallowing enzalutamide tablets? Hi AllI'm shortly starting second line treatment for advanced, inoperable PCa. I also have reflux disease (aka GORD) and hiatus hernia which makes taking large tablets a real challenge. I've been told that the proposed medication (enzalutamide tablets) aren't just large - they're gigantic! My specialist nurse says they can't be crushed or chewed.I'd dearly appreciate hearing readers' hints and tips on swallowing these damn things ( I gather that Abiraterone tabs are just as large).Incidentally, does anyone else agree that it's ironic that my much beloved NHS has to pay £3k a month to keep me alive on these tablets which are so large that I could choke to death on them?
