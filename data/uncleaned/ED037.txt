New phase of ed...I'm been in treatment a couple months now, at the IOP level, and they keep telling me I'm not eating enough, but I feel like I am eating too much! But recently, I've been so hungry. (Not in my stomach, but in my head, in a drive to eat, if that makes sense.) I think I'm eating too much. I'm afraid to tell them what I'm eating, and they still told me last week that it was nowhere close to what I should be eating, but I'm afraid to tell them this week's food. I FEEL like I'm binging. I've never considered purging before, but the thought crossed my mind today. I'm not supposed to exercise, but I did exercise yesterday because I feel like I ate so much! I have also stopped losing weight and I don't know how to handle that. :(I don't know how to deal with this extreme hunger!! Is this normal? Has this happened to other people?
