partners DID trigged anxietyby laceyjayne » Wed Apr 30, 2014 12:03 pmI am new here so kind of scared of posting. I have PTSD. I have an associated anxiety disorder. I have worked very hard to heal and lead a balanced normal life and am very grateful for the healing I have accomplished. Over the last six months I have felt better than I ever have, was able to reduce medication and I felt my partner and I were in a really good space and happier than we had been in a long time. My partner has DID with 3 personalities. That has been challenging at times and until recently, I had felt that my partner did not understand that being in relationship with someone with DID is not always easy. He used to minimize the impact and confusion it sometimes had on me. lately he has acknowledged it and that has been so helpful. As I said I felt everything was going well, until a short time ago when he has revealed some information, one of the things being that his protector alter wants a girlfriend including a sexual relationship. At first he told me he didn't think that it was appropriate it be me. This shattered me and has triggered my anxiety big time, I am finding each day a struggle. He has since told me that maybe I could be the girlfriend. Im struggling unsure and full of fear and feel alone because there is no one I can discuss this with I feel isolated. My partner and I love each other very much. just needing to express myself
