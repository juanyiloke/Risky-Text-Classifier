ÊCan't concentrateHi, I am on Olanzapine(Antipsychotic) and Flumod (SSRI). But, I am not seeing any improvement. In fact, I am having these psychotic episodes (where I think everyone is talking about me and are trying to humiliate me) every night just before I take my medication. Other than these psychotic episodes I am also having hard time understanding what people say or what I read. It's not that I can't hear them or I can't see what I read... It's just that I can't concentrate on words and sounds because I am too preoccupied with my anxiety and some sentence that I keep repeating to myself. What can I do? I am frustrated because I can't communicate with people because, half the time I can't understand what they are saying.... I am also having trouble remembering stuff and recalling stuff. I also feel that I have forgotten everything before my first psychotic breakdown. What can I do to feel better. Is it a side effect of Olanzapine that I can't concentrate or should I take some anti anxiety pill to reduce my anxiety and feel calm so that I can concentrate more on what is gong on in the present? or is it the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia ? Will psychotherapy help me address these issues?
