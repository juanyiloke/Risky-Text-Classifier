is my son having an attack?? Hello, My son was diagnosed with asthma when he was a baby and seemed to grow out of it by the time he was two. He is now 15 and has it again. The problem is when the doctor diagnosed it again it was because he was just taking extra deep breaths every minute or so. After two days of puffers he was better . Two weeks ago he started again and tonight has complained it is more often even though he is still doing all the medications. He has no other symptoms. Is this an attack or just what asthma is. I am sorry if this seems a stupid question. The only experience of Asthma was when i was at school and a friend had it. However she was totally different and i could hear her wheezing etc. I am going to take him to the doctors tomorrow but would really like your opinions on this. Thanks
