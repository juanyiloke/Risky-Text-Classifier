smoking! !¥	I stopped smoking on Friday, Its took me some time to get my act together, I was to stressed to even contemplate stopping upon diagnosis, I wish I'd never started  (age 16 ). It's took my mind off bc though cause all I can think about is a ciggie, I dare not sit still for long, but I'm determined though, been given a fighting chance at life, sure ain't going to throw it away, any tips from ex smokers will be gratefully received,  or alternatively any smokers out there want to quit we can go through the agony together, it certainly ain't easy x
