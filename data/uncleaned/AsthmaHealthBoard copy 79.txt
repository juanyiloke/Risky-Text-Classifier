Spirometry with Flow/Volume Loops & FeNO Tests________________________________________Hey guys, I am a 25yo male and have had asthma my whole life. I am sure I have grown out of it as I have not had asthma for a long time, however a specialist seems to think otherwise.I am currently working on getting a Class 2 medical for my private pilots license and am having some trouble getting pas the CAA with a history of asthma. I have been referred to a sleep and breathing institute for some more intense tests!My question is, can anyone tell me what the following tests involve.- Spirometry with Flow/Volume loops- FeNOI have been smoking for quite a while, since about 17 and am a bit worried if I will have issues passing these tests! Its a 700$$ test and would really like to know what im walking into so I can prepare myself a bit more then justthrowing away 700$300$ for initial GP assessment and referral, 700$ for these tests and another 300$ for another consultation with the specialist to review and write an opinion on the results. This is after spending over 1500 already on my medical alone!  Appreciate any help!Thanks!
