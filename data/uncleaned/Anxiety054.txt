Anxiety and weight loss?Hello I am a 38 year old male. I am generally described as a natural worrier as always dread the worst.Lately I have lost quite a bit of weight and this has caused my anxiety to become worse as i am not dieting and haven't changed anything in my life.The doctors have ran numerous blood tests, chest X-rays, internal cameras (up&down) and ultra sounds on liver,kidneys, spleen,gallbladder, prostrate and pancreas. All came back clear apart from mild gastritis and a small hiatus hernia.However I feel that I am still losing weight but could this be because of me worrying too much? Can stress and anxiety actually be the cause?Can you actually lose weight due to too much worry?Any help would be much appreciatedThanks
