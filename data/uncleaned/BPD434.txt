ÊThis is lonelinessI find myself avoiding relationships because of my actions. I have done terrible things in relationships and been abusive and out of control. Now I am clean off drugs and alcohol and feel slightly more stable and in control. I still don't trust myself to get close to someone. I feel like in my mind my close relationships are so cloudy and misunderstood to myself. I have almost no long standing friends and very few friends at all. I feel a strong draw into having sexual relationships but even those I dissconnect from on a whim. I watch myself hert people but at the time it seems so justified. It's hard being so disconnected and coming up with excuses as to why I don't date or want to engage into a sexual relationship. A part of me wants to tell a really close friend of mine. We have a very open relationship and can talk about sex and feelings together and there is some sexual tension between us. I don't let anything happen cause I know he deserves better. I've been starving myself trying to feel some self worth. All this work into getting clean and sober and I'm still a mess. But I feel great and high all the time. I'm vegan and work outdoors and usually very happy as long as I'm not putting into a relationship. I don't know , this disorder is confusing.
