I have been having extremely distubing and violent dreams for just over a year and a half now and at the most I get about an hour sleep where this doesn't happen a night. Some traumatic events happened one after the other around two years ago, just before the dreams happened. I have tried explaining this to my GP and they say its just stress and it will go but that was a year ago. It's driving me insane and I'm now terrified to go to sleep. I have also started having panic attacks when in crowded/busy areas and this never used to happen. If anyone has any suggestions/advice I would be most grateful!
