eating disorderJust because im in such a desperate place, ive had an eating issue since i was about 16 now 49 ive kind of had really bad downs and recognised the control around how much i eat and exercise. The last 18 months have been hell, i was admotted to a psychiatric unit October 2013 for depression, i was aware that my food intake was becoming less and less and obsessive exercise more.It then became all i could think about and was also going through a very horrible divorce with a a  man who was emotionally abusive, I was officially diagnosed with annorexia and again admotted to a psychiatric unit for a re feeding programme weighing 43kg, with support from the eaing disorder team. I was then discharged and missed 2 appointments because i also have depression so they closed my case. I have support from  the MH team , but i have in total been in hospital 7 times 4 months in psychatric and the other medical because of OD. I now weigh 35kg BMI of 13 and just dont want to live. Im sharing this because im desperate and anyone else out there is struggling please dont leave it untill it takes over your life. If you have worries about eating issues seek help before it takes control, im not sure where my future is all i know is the complete lack of understaanding and support is so utterly isolating all i can think about is a way out
