Why is this happening?It's been a long time since I've been active on this forum. A lot has happened and I thought I was fine.ÊLately I've been drinking a lot. Alone mostly. And I don't know why. I can't stop thinking about the knives in my apartment either. It's been years since I last hurt myself but I want to. I feel like it's a constant fight not to.ÊEvery single day I'm thinking about ending it all. I'm so sad all the time and I don't have anyone. I plan it all the time. If I just killed myself now, who would care? Who would know?ÊI don't know what to do with myself.I am a burdento everyone in my life. I am always feeling depressed and sick and now it has cost me my job. My poor family has better things to do than worry about a middle aged ugly useless woman like me. I am nothing but a burden. It is my own fault. There is no one to blame but myself. No one. I know it is a fact that everything in this world would improve if I was not in it. I am trapped in this spiraling vortex of selfishness, laziness, fear, and regret. I think all hope may be gone.The EndHello~ I am sorry I keep posting I just really feel like killing myself right now. I feel okay during the day but at night I can't take it anymore. I don't want to live like this where each night I have to fight to keep from killing myself. I am very tired. I am so tired. I can't fight anymore. Please, I am so sorry I really need help. I know part of it is I have been drinking but I don't feel like I can stop that either. I am so desperate. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Again, I am so sorry as this is my fault and my fault alone I just can't take anymore. Thank You.
