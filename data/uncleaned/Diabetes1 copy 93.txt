ConfusedI have type two diabetes and am struggling to get my reading below 20-25. I am. Have double vision, I have stopped driving. . I had an appointment with DN and I am on 2000mg metformin sr and 360 mg Gliclazide also 100mg of januvia, none of this has worked so she is talking about putting me on an injection not insulin, one a day. She needed to speak to the DD as I am on ally of medications and she needed to check if I could take it. I am still waiting to hear that was 4 days ago and now it's the weekend, I now feel awful, so depressed, tired, just not wanting to be here, and I don't know what to do. I have no appetite, please can some one help
