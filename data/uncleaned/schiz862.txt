I've been thinking about this for some time now and thought I'd create an account to ask the question... Before I explain it I'd like to add that I am aware of the definition of 'positive and negative' symptoms. But what I want to know is if its possible for individuals to actually 'benefit' from a form of schizophrenia? Imagine you hear voices and see things and can interact with them completely rationally and sensibly, but in a way that the voices help you answer questions, help debate things, show you the way to do something etc. Basically for as long as I can remember I have always been introspective and reflect on things after the situation has passed, and some times I have quite vived thought discussions with myself (?) And I was wondering if this could develop at all in the future? Although I have always been able to differentiate between fantasy/reality no matter what situation I've been in (drunk, under influence of drugs, emergencies, etc.) And I've always managed to stay rational and interpret situations in a logical way... If that makes sense. Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated :) In short: Hearing beneficial voices that help you instead of destroy you?
