BG spike after meal then hypo's 2 hrs laterHi,I have been trying to work out a way to eliminate the spike after a meal without going low a couple of hours later.For example, last night pre-meal I was 5.8. I had 50g of carbs and took 4 units of Novorapid (carb ratio is 1:12 - I think). 1 hr later I was 8.5, which was ok I guess but would prefer for it to be under 8.0. 2 hrs after my meal I was 4.0 so I had a biscuit with 10g of carbs. 20 mins after that I was 3.7 so had another biscuit, then 20 mins after that I was 3.4 so I had a small glass of lemonade.I guess the obvious answer is that I took too much insulin but if I took any less then surely I would have had a high reading 1 hr after my meal? How do I eliminate a high reading after a meal without going low a couple of hours later?TIA
