Oh dear not a good start on the libre, need some adviceI set up and started my first sensor this morning...Did my first scan an hour later... Chuffed it read 5.5, didn't take a BG at this point, took a comparison after a couple more test, roughly an hour or so, my senor was saying I was steady, sensor said 4.9 but my combi handset said 7.4 quite a bit different.. A 3,7 on the sensor, my actual level was 5.9... I went to get some material we needed for our garden refurb, I came out the shop felt low, so scanned it said LO, I was 3.3, so treated and waited until my bg was back to 4,9 before heading off in the car to our next stop, the supermarket... Where upon I never got a readinh other than LOW... When I finally got a ready of 3, I was in in fact 5I'm hoping that this large difference is because the senor is settling in, and the levels will end up a bit closer by tomorrow.. But tonight, it decided to throw a spanner in the works, refusing to provide a reading, and when I finally got one, I noticed that it hasn't registered any reading for a short time span! So a gap in the graph...I can't say what the difference between the senor reading and the actual meter, as they didn't include any test strips with the starter pack! Which I actually find disgraceful indeed. I did try to purchase some while in Sainsbury's as we have a pharmacy in ours... But as usual the chemist wasn't keen on selling them to a diabetic!!!!!! So gave upI am seeing the doctor on Monday, so will mention and see I can have a prescription and have a small supply added to my repeat.... But any tips or tricks, even reassurance would be appreciated
