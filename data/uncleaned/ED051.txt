sick and tired of being sick and tiredI am just so sick and tired of being sick and tired. my mom says that that is a turning point, is that true?I am 23 yrs old, am underweight, and rapidly declining. I just went on a binge/purge two nights ago. I purged very hard. I told my friend, she says she's really worried about me because of all my weight loss, purging, and restricting.I don't know what to do anymore, I am fed up with this never ending cycle of emotions, of lies, and disordered behavior. I feel so cold all the time! I can't get warm. I'm okay now, only just feeling so alone, lost, and misunderstood. can anyone help me??
