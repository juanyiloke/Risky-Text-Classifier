Relaxation - a way of coping with stress ?Yesterday I gave my regular talk about 'relaxation' to a pulmonary rehab group at the local hospital - I usually start the talk by asking those attending about the particular stresses that have been brought on by their medical condition and what they have tried to do to help themselves cope with these problems. I have learnt over the years that talking about the topic 'Relaxation' suggests many things to many people   so I do my best initially to relate the explanation of my relaxation technique to their situation. Most of them described the stresses as their frustration at not being able to do what they used to be able to do, their dependence on others, and their fear and anxiety about symptoms getting worse. Alll of them were keen to learn how to help themselves cope; already some of them knew of other relaxation techniques such as Tai Chi or the "Tighten and let go" technique of all the muscles throughout the body, one thought it was what you did to help you get to sleep but most of the others were sceptical of any technique.Having given this talk several times now, I have come to appreciate the benefits, but also the difficulties and limitations in the learning of a relaxation technique as a coping mechanism in stressful situations. The method I talk about is known as the Mitchell Method of Relaxation, a tecnique I learnt when I was working as a physiotherapist, the link is below:-Mitchell Rlaxation Method(The actual instructions can be dowloaded from there as a pdf )I wonder what others here on the Forum think of the usefulness of learning a relaxation technique as a coping mechanism : ???
