ÊBPD, others' experiences and advice?Hi Guys and Gals.Whilst admitted as an inpatient in hospital last year, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I was a little shocked because I've been in the mental health system for over 10 years yet they've only just spotted this.Since my diagnosis, I've had no explanation of this disorder or how to deal with it in my day to day life. I was recently discharged from the mental health services as a group I was due to attend was cancelled. I feel like I'm really starting to struggle again with aggressive and intrusive thoughts and don't know where to turn for advice and help.Anything you lovelies could tell me woud be very much appreciated!Francesca xx
