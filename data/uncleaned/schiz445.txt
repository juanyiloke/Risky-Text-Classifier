ÊIs taking Korean Ginseng while also taking Quetiapine Modified Release (Seroquel XL) a bad idea?I had psychosis at the end of 2009 going through to start of 2010, but was never given a proper diagnosis other than Psychotic Disorder: Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). I was however told that I definitely don't have Bipolar disorder, so I have always suspected it must be Schizophrenia, although that was sort of denied also.I am under the care of my GP and still take every night Quetiapine Modified Release 300mg, mostly to keep a lid on my anxiety.Over the last few months I have had low energy levels, and have been consuming caffeine to try to compensate, but it has mostly stopped working, and does make anxiety worse. My low energy levels is really making working difficult.I would like to try Korean Ginseng to see if that could help with my energy levels. However, there are warnings that it can cause mania and ultimately psychosis. However, this seems to be in people who are Bipolar? Is this true? I don't suffer from a mood disorder, and have never received treatment for that.ÊIs trying Korean Ginseng a bad idea for me?Many thanks for any help.
