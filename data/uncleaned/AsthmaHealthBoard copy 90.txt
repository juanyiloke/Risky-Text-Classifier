Guess I need inhaler!________________________________________  well I am an idiot! Just getting over pneumonia, knew my Qvar controller inhaler was low ,but put off ordering new one. Resulted in being without for couple days. Wow I had no idea! Thought it was not a big deal. Asthma diagnosis was new . Guess it hadn't really sunk in, wasn't accepting it. Or at least I thought it wouldn't be a problem for a few days. I was wrong. Hard to tell when med stops coming out of inhaler. However Wednesday evening I started feeling SOB and it continues today(Sunday). Inhaller came Friday and I have taken doses as prescribed sense x2 / day. Think I was not without inhaler meds more then couple days. But am beginning to worry . Thought I would feel better by now. But breathlessness continues along with fatigue. Don't want to have to call doctor. Took rescue inhaler about 1 hr ago. Seemed to work but not for long. I am not having an emergency just very uncomfortable. Anyone have any words of wisdom?
