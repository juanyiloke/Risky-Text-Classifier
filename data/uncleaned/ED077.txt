New HereHi!I have had an eating disorder for almost 10 years. I was anorexic for the first year and have been binge eating and over exercising to control my weight for the past 9. I was forced to go to counseling by my parents when I was anorexic, but I really didn't like my counselor. (She was pregnant at the time and told me that no one likes gaining weight, even her being pregnant. I totally shut down to her after that and just went through the actions because gaining weight to support a child is different that gaining weight to recover from an eating disorder.) I started to binge eat to get back to a normal weight so I would be "recovered" and kept on binge eating. I feel too ashamed to talk to people I know about my eating habits, but need a way to talk it out. I know in my mind how to stop this and, with the day that I consider to be the 10 year mark coming up next week, I want to make it known that I refuse to live any more of my life like this. I will not keep binge eating. Because I don't want to tell my family or friends about this, I want to tell someone in the world that I am going to stop. I need to think there is someone out there that I need to be accountable to in this regard. I just want to feel that my voice is heard.
