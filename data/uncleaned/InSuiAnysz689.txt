I was raped by an abusive boyfriend a few years ago. Since then my confidence has deteriorated, although my family are very caring and my boyfriend (a different one) is lovely, I feel completely unable to cope.ÊI have already interrupted a year from University, and I feel completely incapable of writing essays, particularly my dissertation, without having a melt down. I feel low constantly, feel no hope for the future, and the pain that's inside me is constant.I can't see how I'll ever feel better, and am seriously contemplating suicide.
