Breast ImplantsYou might not want to read this.So I've had 2 kids recently and my boobs went from 38D to a 38B almost overnight - once the breastfeeding finished. The loose skin sags. Visited my sister a few months after I'd finished breastfeeding and she nodded and said "yes, you can tell you've finished". She didn't mean anything bad about it, her boobs never grew past a B. But while I've lost weight - smaller now than I ever was at a size 12 - my breast really depress me. I can't stand to look at myself naked. I didn't have half this problem when I was a size 16. And while my husband says he still loves my breasts I can feel the looseness of skin when he touches them.ÊBasically I want a boob job.ÊI'd never really given much consideration to one before these last few months but now it's almost all I think about - usually when changing or undressing for bed, or showering.ÊI suppose I just want someone to tell me they've done it and been happy with it. I've never even had braces (though I could use those as well) so I'm nervous about going and surgically changing a part of my body.ÊI'm also nervous about people noticing. My mother in law is the most critical person in the world. When I was pregnant and due to be married 4 months after having the baby I said I should be down to the size 14 (to fit the dress) by the date, she suggested I'd be down to a 12. When she met me I was a 16 so I don't know where she was getting that idea. And my own mother isn't much better - though she might think it's a wonderful idea (making myself better?).ÊJust tell me what you think? Could it be worth the trouble of having the "yes, I've had a boob job" with the two of them?
