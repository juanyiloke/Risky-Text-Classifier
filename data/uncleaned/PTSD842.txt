Êa lack of warnings on TV
In the UK there are always warnings of bad language which might upset some viewers, and also warnings of flashing lights.

I wish there were health warnings about people receiving electric shocks appearing in TV programs so that I wouldn't have it all coming back again and again. There was even an electric shock machine bought on that auctions program "Bargain hunt" today.Ê

but I suppose if they tried to warn against every single way there was of upsetting people there would be no TV at all.Ê

I know to never watch any programs about being in hospital, but I can't avoid everything.

A hospital doctor I had to go and see described me to my GP as "a nice, but very anxious man". I am always anxious in the company of men in white coats. Maybe I should always carry a black overcoat and insist in male doctors wearing it when seeing to me. I don't have a problem with women in white coats.
