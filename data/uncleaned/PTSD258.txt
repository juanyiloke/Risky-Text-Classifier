I found something positive with my PTSDby Jam4 » Wed Jul 02, 2014 8:16 pmI have PTSD for two reasons. One, I'm a domestic abuse survivor. And second, my children and I survived an apartment fire last November. Since that fire, I've had a really heighten sense of smell. I panic at certain smells. Well, today, I just may have saved my family because of keen sense of smell. I went down to the basement and immediately smelled something weird. I got this frighted feeling and wanted to get out. I thought it might have been a gas leak, but wasn't sure. Not sure what it smells like, but I knew it wasn't supposed to be there. I told my husband and he made me call to gas company.Sure enough,we had a leak. The man said it was small and none hazardous right now. But we're about to go on vacation and the house was going to be locked up for a week. No one else could smell it. The gas man said he was surprised that I even picked it up. So, if I wouldn't have have the PTSD from the fire, I might not have smelled anything, and my family could have died from the gas leak. I'm very proud of myself for saving my family for the second time. Does anyone else have a positive story from PTSD?
