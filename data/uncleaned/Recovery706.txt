positive energyMy tip for staying well when suffering from anxiety and depression- channel your energies into something positive , find something that moves you, help others, build a cause. After the death of my son to suicide i founbd that i had to make something good come out of the tradgedy, i wanted a legacy that would honour my son. So I became a volunteer for beyondblue and lifeline and with their support and the team from the blackdog institute I arrange mental health presentations and travel to schools and talk to the students. Over the last three years i have spoken to thousands of our youth and many have been helped. This has given me impetus in my life, something to strive and work for. In this I have found a true legacy for my son, i have found help for my depression and most importantly - have made a difference and helped others.
