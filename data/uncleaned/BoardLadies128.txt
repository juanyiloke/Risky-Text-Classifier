Facebook scaremongeringIn the last few days I've had two similar warnings pop up on my newsfeed warning women about elaborate plans involving an altruistic act on their part leading to their rape and murder. The first was 'set' in South Africa and described a man in a shopping centre car park offering to help a woman change her tyre after which he asks for a lift to his car. The woman's spider senses tingle and she goes back to get the security guard. When they get back to the car the guy is gone but his briefcase is in her car containing knives and duct tape and other murder paraphanalia. The second was 'set' in New Zealand and involved a car seat on the side of the road with a fake baby in it, luring a woman to stop and be dragged to her doom.ÊThe emotive language in these posts had my bullsh!tometer twitching. I can't seem to copy and paste from FB and they're too long for a screen grab. The creepiest part for me was at the end of the first:Ê Why would someone want to put this kind of message out there- making women feel unsafe and warning them against altruism? Especially since most violence against women is perpetrated in the home or other 'safe' places by someone known to them. The whole thing smacks of misogyny and 'keeping women in their place'.
