ÊMunchiesI have had disordered eating my entire life and have been diagnosed with bulimia for 14 years. I have also been smoking weed for almost as long. I have been in recovery for about a year and a half, although I am struggling and on shaky ground. I thoroughly enjoy weed and have no plans to quit. My frustration is with the unpredictability of the high. So sometimes it can increase symptoms, but other times its can eliminate them for the time being. I was wondering if other stoners with eating disorders face the same unique issues as a result of the two.Ê
