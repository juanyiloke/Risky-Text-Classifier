I have been diagnosed with bi polor disorder and PTSD and borderline personality disorder. I constantly seek out photos of famous deaths and autopsy reports. why do I have this obsession? Is there anyone out there who has dealt with and conquered this? I am looking at ECT treatments because no meds have worked for me yet. I feel like I am losing the game and I will go thru with suicide. I fear my own hand...I have a plan to carry it out fully so there is hopefully no mistakes. But I want to learn to live and laugh again. I have 3 beautiful young adult children and a good husband and I do not want to burden them with my death...because it is a selfish act. However it would end my misery and the misery I cause them. Anyone is welcome to write back to me.
