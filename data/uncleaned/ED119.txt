Away from homeHello everyone, I recently found out about this forum via twitter (I highly recommend you follow the NEDA account if you don't already) and thought I would give it a try. Honestly I have no idea where to start, so maybe I can give some background information first and pose my first question.I am currently going into my fifth year of battling bulimia on-and-off. I had been doing so well with recovery last year until I started my freshman year of college in August and relapsed horribly. I am a perfectionist, so I know I put so much more stress on myself than I needed. I did try counseling here, but unfortunately the college I attend is known for crappy heath services. I tried my best to keep an open mind, but I couldn't help feeling much more judged than with my past counselors, and at one point I even felt as though I was scolded. I am hoping that this forum may help to provide some support and guidance that I very much need.With starting college, I do enjoy the newfound freedoms and responsibilities, but I also miss my friends and family. I do not know very many people at school, so I do get lonely and depressed at points. In addition to the regular pressures that come with the college curriculum, I know I have turned to binging and purging as my choice of comfort.I have tried talking to my parents about this, but they really just do not get it. As much as I love them, I think they see this as a minor phase. My mom even sent me a bunch of candy and junk food in a care package right after I told her that I relapsed. Bulimic + a surplus of comfort food= not a good idea. I guess I am just looking for some tips as to how I can conquer this while at the university away from home. Any advice, guidance or tips would be greatly appreciated (:
