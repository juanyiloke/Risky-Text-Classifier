Office gossip2012-01-30, 09:37 PMHow do you handle office gossip? What if it's about you?ÊI'm asking because yesterday, most of the people at my work were talking about this one guy and the mistakes/blunders he made and that he's so fat when he bends over everyone sees his buttbcrack and that his office nickname is "buttcrack", etc etc etc. The thing is I knew this guy and I knew he's a new father and he's just doing his best at work and in his family life. I know that money is tight for him so he has to wear his old clothes. It's not that we were good friends but I just felt hurt that people were talking such things about him and yet they knew little about his backstory. I tried to explain to them but their response was "oh so you're such good friends." I just wanted people to see two sides of every story, of every person. For me, it was like "come on, give the guy a break."So anyway, if this was how they talk about this one guy, I was thinking that maybe they talk about me, too.
