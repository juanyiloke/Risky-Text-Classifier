Lost this fight but am going to win the warWell what a pita I mow grass for a living (used to anyway) I have had to give away over half my clients as I couldn't service them. Now I can't even leave the house with extreme anxiety. I judge my days by getting out of bed and putting on my work shirt, someday's I finish getting dressed and go to work.I have had this illness for 30 plus years,have a great medical team behind me,a fantastic wife.But with all this I still cop a beating everyday. So as I say have lost a fight today but am going to win the war. (This is just a little rant)
