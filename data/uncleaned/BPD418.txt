ÊInterpreting Social Group DynamicsSo, I've gotten involved with a new group and trying to figure out the dynamics. I'm very analytical and an INTJ.ÊOne thing that really frustrates me about social groups is just the labeling that goes on. I see it happen all the time.. Someone does something that someone else doesn't like. So they talk to someone else about it, and then they label the person.. they talk to others and pretty soon the group reacts to that person like they actually are that label. The only problem is, the group is wrong, and the person in question is forced to figure out how to deal with the situation.ÊI worry about this happening to me. And it has happened to me on occasion. Because of some reactions lately, I'm afraid this group may have defined me as a racist homophobe. I am neither.... But, what to do? My reasoning is so subtle, that I think I'd come across as crazy if I tried to explain why I think this is the case (that they've decided this about me).ÊCan anyone else relate to what I'm saying?
