The difference the libre makesI've noticed that my sugars tend to be creeping higher without the freestyle libre (I can't afford a sensor constantly so doing about one a month). My husband said that with the sensor I was scanning it every half hour or so, whereas I only have a limited supply of test strips so I can still just do my 8 a day. Also, the libre tells which direction the sugars are going, so I was able to prevent a hypo before it happened, but without it I test, see I'm on say 6.1, think 'that's okay then.' Then end up hypo half hour later. It's amazing the difference.
