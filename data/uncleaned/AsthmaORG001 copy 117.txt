correlation between peak flow and symptoms? A,m still have a significant increase in symptoms at the moment, not yet brought under better control by the increase in Seretide dosage. No infection, I think, but lots of morning coughing and scary wheeziness, tight chest and more rapid, or harder work breathing during the day, and a strange sensation of having to breathe out first before breathing in, everything feels the wrong way round. But I see no real drop in my peak flow, which compared to last year's flare-up average of 300, is much better this year averages 350 - 370, and reaching personal best of 390 now only very infrequently. This morning's episodes calmed after several ventolin puffs which then took my peak flow to 400, a new high, but I don't usually see such great reversibility, more often between 6 - 12 %. I see some members here have a much wider variability, and therefore possibly more correlation between symptoms and peak flow reading? I am not wishing dramatic drops in peak flow, of course, but with minor to moderate variability, there seems to be no other way of forecasting a worsening of my asthma, rather than observing symptoms, and I am not sure I am entirely a reliable witness! As they are either sneaking up on me (increasingly the case), or I am perhaps over-obsreving my breathing in case of them sneaking up.I am wondering what the case is with others?
