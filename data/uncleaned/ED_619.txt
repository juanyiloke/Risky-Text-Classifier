Hard work + HungerHi everyone,ÊI am seeking some advice.ÊI've been in recovery for just over a year, and I'm doing pretty well.ÊI've started a new job and I'm absolutely loving it. However, the job is very physically demanding. I'm often on my feet for eight hours a day, lifting heavy things, running around etc. By the time I come home from work, I feel absolutely starving. I eat a good breakfast and lunch, but that doesn't seem to matter! I feel like I end up eating more than I should, and it gives me some binge flashbacks sometimes.ÊHas anyone dealt with this before? Is there a way to deal with the intense hunger feeling in a better way?
