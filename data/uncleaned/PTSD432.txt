Êanyone done a trauma narrative?T wants me to do a practice one this week. In session, I was sure I knew what she meant. Now that I try to sit down and do it, I am stumbling all over myself and it's not even the much heavier stuff we will be doing later...ÊShe said to write it in detail, beginning/middle/end... only now I don't know what that means. I get stupid walking into therapy, but apparently I get stupider afterwards... She said I could do art around it as well if I wanted, whatever was easier.ÊI'm so confused. Has anyone here done one? What's it like? (thinking my assumption around T's expectations are creeping in to make this way harder than it should be).ÊThanks.
