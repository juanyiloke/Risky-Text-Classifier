ÊI don't know where I'm at...please helpPlease bear with me, I don't post on forums often.ÊBut I hate myself right now..I don't know what to do. I have been diagnosed with anorexia and anxiety and I get the anxiety thing but I don't think I am anorexic. I don't mean that I don't have an eating disorder because I clearly do but don't think I'm anorexic because I can't stop eating at night. I'm 5'4 and I know I'm underweight but not much and am stable. I don't eat all day but in the evening I get bored and eat. Tonight I had a pizza. Also when I drink I am completely unable to restrict even though I want to. I am able to be sick though.my anxiety never gets better though. I don't feel like I want to die but I do sometimes take pills when I see no other option. I want to ignore the world and switch off and if I had the money I would book a house in the middle of nowhere, not buy any food and get thin. But I've had enough and I'm struggling to work. I feel so alone and my thoughts are so jumbled. I don't know what to do and I can't do much more. help me please. I just want to escape. I want to have friends and go back to my old life. I was on my own then and I felt lonely, but I was at least able to hold a conversation with someone and didn't feel miserable all the time.What do I want? To be happy and do that by making friends and getting skinny. Please help me. Therapists and doctors dont. Not because they are bad at their job but because I'm rubbish at saying how I really feel when I'm in an appointment. Help!
