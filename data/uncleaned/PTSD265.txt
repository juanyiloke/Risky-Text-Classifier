could a psychotic break cause ptsd?by thirdeyeguy » Tue Mar 25, 2014 1:32 amAbout two years ago I had my first psychotic break. I'm still awaiting diagnosis, but my docs are pretty sure I have schizzoaffective disorder.When I had my break I went through a lot of stress. I thought my fiance was possessed by Hitler's ghost and the illuminati was going to torture me on some sort of medieval torture device. People's faces would turn into demons, and I would hear a demon in my head that would say terrible things to me. My family took me to the hospital and the people there were not as understanding or caring as they should have been. I remember my fiance was going to have surgery and I told her not to because the illuminati doctors were going to hurt her. By some strange chance her surgery went really bad. She woke up in the middle and was hurt pretty badly. After that I truly believed everything that was happening was real. So now I'm steady on my meds and am not having psychosis, but the memories are still there. I think about it almost every day. Is there a chance I may have developed ptsd from my psychotic break?
