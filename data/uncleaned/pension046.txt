ArgosI have just received an e-mail, apparently from Argos, thanking me for my order (I haven't ordered anything from them, nor even been on their website, to the best of my knowledge). When I try to track the order number on their website, it doesn't go in. The e-mail shouldn't have reached me, anyway, I don't recall enabling Argos as someone they could put direct into my mailbox (usually it goes into the junk folder if from someone who isn't one of my acknowledged contacts). I don't think I have ever registered for an account with Argos, so they shouldn't have any payment details they could use, but I'm not happy about this. Attempts to reply to the e-mail result in a notification of delivery failure. Anyone else had this experience with Argos?
