Confused about wanting/not wanting children (at my age)Hello lady boardsies,Am trying to get my head around something.I've never been the maternal type. I mean, I love kids, and Ive great fun with them. They crack me up. And then I can hand them back. That was always my attitude.Im rolling on to 40 now (wow-where did the time go?). Am single. I love being single-I dont have an issue with this. Maybe Ill meet someone, maybe I wont. But it probably wont happen during my child bearing years.The thing Im a bit conflicted with is, I just always assumed Id meet someone and then be crazy to have kids. The want would kick in. Thats obviously not happened.Are there any other poster out there who sorta "get" what am trying to verbalise? Is it because an option that was always open to me is now closing? Am I saying goodye to an "ideology"? Am a bit confused to feel this, because I never was gung-ho on having (my own) children. I'd even consider adoption (I dont know if this is possible at single and 40) - seems more appealing to me, than having my own./Confuzzled
