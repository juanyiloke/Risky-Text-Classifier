Bit of a moanWas out today after having had chemo yesterday, so was feeling particularly sensitive to the cold. Anyway, got desperately thirsty, but couldn't find anywhere I could get anything anywhere near room temperature - in the end got a Coke, no ice from Burger King and waited half an hour with it between my legs to warm up! Guess I should have been more prepared but really thought I'd be able to find something non-refrigerated, especially at this time of year.Anyway, there are worse things to moan about I suppose, just fancied a rant!
