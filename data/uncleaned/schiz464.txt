 Are we just a management problem?What prompted me to ask, is a recent campaign for homeless people. Listening to the discussion on radio four, the assistant presenter pointed out that in one particular case a homeless man with addiction mental health issues had cost the NHS 100, 000 pounds a year for several years until he received help to get off the streets, because he was diabetic. Every time he was close to going into a diabetic coma, he would call an ambulance, then after a couple of days care would be sent straight back out to the streets again. She pointed out just how much money the nhs had saved by helping him.Is there really actually much empathy on the Tory front bench, or back benches for disabled people or are we simply a management problem? At which point does genuine care and empathy for disabled people come into play? With psychiatrists and GP’s probably receiving bonuses for keeping people out of hospital, and over worked cpn’s rushing around to home visits for 5 minute visits, similar to care for the elderly. Are we simply management problems, to be kept out of the NHS beds and the overstretched prison system in order to save cash?
