ÊWhat would you do?I have struggled with problems around eating for about 19 years now. Am now admittedly slightly underweight, but only by a tiny amount. My dad called the other day and bluntly said he thought I looked like I have an eating disorder, which kind off annoyed me! Simply because he's never bothered before, so don't feel he has the right to lecture me now.Anyway, went to the GP this week to ask for help because I do recognise that I have a few issues and have had for ages. Got completely fobbed off and told I look ok and I'll be fine, just eat more etc.My younger sister (23) is aware I have some problems but not sure she understand exactly. She wants to arrange treating our dad to dinner out in the next couple of weeks and I have been completely roped into this, despite her knowing I have problems and also even just going outside! She keeps asking 'so is x date good for you then', although not asking, more telling. Feels like there's no room to say no, if you see what I mean. I think it's a lovely idea, and I'd love to, but how?! All I can see is being totally shown up in front of her, her partner who I don't even know, my dad, his friends etc. because am I going to eat, especially in front of people with eyes? No. Of course not! Aside from the fact that I'm a complete germ phobe and wouldn't even order a takeaway at home if I actually ate properly. I'm not sure what makes her think, being aware of all this, that it's a good idea to try to guilt trip me into doing this. I'm annoyed because I asked her a week or so ago, if she could mind our kids for a short while (under half hour) so my husband could come with me to the dentist because I'm terrified of dentist and couldn't have got there without him, and I had a dental abscess so it couldn't wait, and she then said 'now you gotta come out for dinner'. I don't actually know how to get out of this without everyone thinking badly of me or falling out with them.
