Zen-Buddhism to Control One's EmotionsIn Buddhism, the point is that happiness can be just as bad as its opposite of anguish. After all, happiness and anguish are opposite sides of the same coin. If one focuses just on happiness all the time, it won't work, because there will come times when something painful happens, at which point all the happiness fades away. So the aim of Buddhism is to attain serenity. And that serenity is attained through meditation.In the chatroom, I've met two others who practice meditation, and it helps them as much as it has helped me. So I just wanted to share it in this motivational section. Let me repeat, the aim of Buddhism is not happiness but instead serenity. Happiness can be destroyed at any time by pain but Serenity from meditation enables one to tolerate whatever pain we encounter.
