A Personal Comment on Statins and My Heart.My apologies for my recent absence from the forum. I had to attend a family funeral in rural NSW, 1500km away, with no phone or web access. Two days drive each way and a couple of nights there. I just got back on Sunday night and spent Monday with medical appointments for my wife and I. This relates to my visit to the cardiologist.I first wrote this as a personal post on facebook. I decided to repeat it here because I know several people are interested in the statin debate. However, I must remind you that my personal experiences are anecdotes, not data.  My doctor has been polite and patient with me when I have consistently refused a statin for the past eight years despite high cholesterol by official standards. My HDL and trigs are fine but my LDL is very high. He suggests that may be because of my way of eating. He strongly recommended I have a stress echocardiography accompanied by ultrasound of my heart, mainly to reassure him I am not going to keel over tomorrow.I had the tests yesterday. The cardiologist was very thorough. It seems my heart and vascular system are in fine shape. I will continue to refuse the statin and eat low-carb, moderate fat, for good blood glucose levels. I no longer care at all what my LDL is.
