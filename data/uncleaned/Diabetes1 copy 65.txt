How did you first get diagnosed?Hey guys! Ive been recently diagnosed as a type 1 at 18 years old. I first thought i had diabetes when i tested myself at my uncles house who is also a type 1. My levels were 16 which made everyone urge me to go to the doctors. So a few months after i went to the doctors and had a few blood tests. One was high and the other was normal so they sent me away. This was when i knew i had diabetes, now i realise this must have been the time it was developing. When the symptoms became full on i went to my doctors who urged i went to A&e. This was when i found my sugar levels to be 25 and my ketone levels to be 5.6 i was then submitted into hospital for 4 days and was put on a drip. Just wondering, how did you find out you were diabetic and how did you respond?Shan x
