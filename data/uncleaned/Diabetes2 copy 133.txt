DIABETES INSIPIDUS AT AGE 21Hi i am 21 year old and diagnosed with diabetes insipidus in july this year, after a few MRI a small lesion about 5mm was found on the stalk of pituitary gland. Did a few blood test and found out i was not only low in AVP, but also low in testorsterone.Right now all the blood test and spine lumbar puncture that i had done did not give any results regarding what kind of lesion it is (tumour etc). Currently having desmopressin tablets around 3-4 pills a day depending on what time i go to bed.Doctor suggested to have a surgery to take specimen of the lesion but chances of damaging the whole pituitary gland is high. May result in permanent DI and also loss of other hormones. Hence my parents did not want the surgery to be done.i would love to hear back from people that is in the same situation as me.
