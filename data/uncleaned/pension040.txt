Trouble in AmericaI see lately the BBC news have taken to reporting the deaths of two black people( separate incidents) in the USA whilst trying to be arrested by the law enforcement agencies, in both cases the so called assailants were policemen. I have two questions.....Ê1, why is it the BBC labour the point about both accused being WHITE policemen in their news bulletins, they seem to be all over these tragic incidents like a rash. I like to wager had the roles been reversed (ie black onto white) we would all be none the wiser.2, what the devil has it got to do with us.It just proves to me the bias attitude of news reporting at BBC
