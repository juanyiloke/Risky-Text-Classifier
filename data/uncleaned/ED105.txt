ScaredI've suffered with bulimia for probably 3 or 4 years now. I found this website while looking for some relief online. I've developed a sensation in my throat, as if something is stuck. I can not get it to budge... I investigated the internet hoping to find some answers even though I know this usually only leads to more worry and anxiety than before. Of course, esophageal cancer is one of the first results. Now that I am trying to hold back from freaking out, has anyone else experienced this?? I am hoping it is just some mild irritation that will go away on its own with rest. But I want to become healthy again...
