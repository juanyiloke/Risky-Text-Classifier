Diabetes treatment in "da olden days."So I'm watching the movie "Hansel & Gretel: Witch hunters. Tonight & was honestly blown away by the amount of technology & fine tailoring they had in medieval times...They had a crude record player, natty fold out double barrel shot guns. & even a witch proof Gattlin gun...But what realy impressed me was the insulin treatment they had back then in those dark days of inquisitions & pestilence..An adult Hansel years after his ordeal with his sister in the house of candy. About 30minutes into the plot chatting in a bustling market square with the guys "love interest" starts to feel unsteady on his feet & stumbles to a step.Hansel sits down then pulls out a torch sized device. Bravely in public, whilst in front of his new girlfriend injects through his leather trouser leg into his thigh with the shushing sound of a "hypo spray" from Star Trek... After administering the shot. The dialog went something like this.. "I was force fed so much candy by that witch, I was sick. & ever since I have to take this to stay alive." The girl replied with the knowledge of the ancient runes. "Yes, you have the sugar sickness."  Talk about stereotyping all witches as old hags!!
