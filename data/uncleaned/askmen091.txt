How would you interpret this from your boss2012-10-25, 12:13 AMI'm not sure how to interpret this statement from my supervisor. I have a new position; I've been there for four months. Anyways, I work with claims and I have to reach a certain quota every day in order to meet the company goal. I was signing up for overtime and (you have to at least meet the average per day in order to do overtime). I told my supervisor casually that I was meeting the quota and was able to sign up for over time and he said ' Who are you trying to convince me, or yourself? Just an honest question.."ÊHow would you all take this?
