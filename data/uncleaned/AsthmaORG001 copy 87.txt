Asthma an overlooked breath trick and a devastating disease In my youth I was treated with iodine for my very instable asthma, that was not so very effective. At age 17 I had a devastating attack screeching for each breath and each open-mouthed breath making poor me worse instead of better. I've since got rid of the disease for all intents. A probable cause is the turning off of a nasal reflex. See http://www.aipro.info/dr...le/Nas...%20Barelli.pdf "Nasal reflexes, coupled with the resistance of the nose, increase the efficiencyof the lungs and improve the ultimate effectiveness of heart action (Albert andWinters, 1966; Butler, 1960; Edison and Kerth, 1973). This results in a betteralkali reserve in the blood, necessary to maintain body chemistry by lowering thepercentage of lactic acid in the blood (Luescher, 1930). Lactic acid is an importantchemical maintaining a regular rhythm of the heart, rising and falling withbreathing. All other body muscles are kept in tone by this mechanism and all theabove factors increase the capacity for work (Kreewinsch, 1932)."Failure of the nasal reflex would therefore account for my completely miserable condition at the time.This explanation for an asthma attack is not the usual one but must be plausible enough.Another usually overlooked fact in the asthma context is the use of facial massage to breathe deeply. See "Deep Breath" by Osumu Tatsumura (not a medical book). See page 129 about breathing deeply. "Press the points below your eyes as if you were pulling them down"Ia far from being an fan of Cinese medicine with its acupressure points, but this tech certainly works for me.What do people think?
