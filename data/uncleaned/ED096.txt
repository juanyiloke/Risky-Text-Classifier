Wanting FreedomI have a problem with purging. I've struggled with disordered eating since I was 14. I'm now 21 and I am sick of it. I've been relapsing for three weeks now and don't feel in control of my behaviors, but there's also a huge part of me that wants recovery, and more than anything wants freedom from this. I want to learn how to not hate my body. I'm sick and tired of it, of all of it. I'm tired of looking in the mirror and not being able to see anything but fat. I'm tired of getting on the scale and never being satisfied. I'm tired of feeling the need to get on the scale in the first place. And I'm tired of what relapsing into disordered eating does to my life; in the past three weeks I've withdrawn from my social circles and friends. I'm exhausted all the time and have higher levels of depression and anxiety. But I'm a second semester senior in college and have so much good in my life. One of the things I hate most about my ED is the way it clouds my larger perspective on the world, making me focus a much higher proportion of my energy internally. I want to focus on all of the good things in my life and be able to appreciate them to the fullest, and realize that my eating disorder doesn't need to control my life. How to realize that in practice is one of the hardest things I've done.Purging makes me feel utterly alone and hopeless and I'd love some support to not feel so alone.
