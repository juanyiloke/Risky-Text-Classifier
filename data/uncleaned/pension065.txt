FloodsWhat a disastrous winter for many farmers once again - there seems no let up in the wet weather.Ê Seem to recall Avalon sometime ago stressing the importance of dredging and do hope he has not been effected.Ê Non farming folk also badly effected in the South West.Ê We heard from an old friend in Dorset yesterday that the village postmaster is serving customers through a window with his door sandbagged up to stop the water pouring in.
