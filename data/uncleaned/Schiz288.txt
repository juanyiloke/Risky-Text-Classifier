After destroying every job, relationship and home I've ever been in within a few months; after spending months in between jobs looking for one, I've finally been diagnosed. My problem now is what is something I'm not going to run away from or sabotage? Im about to be homeless because I have no income.ÊI always liked to assume I was good at everything but now Im being told to take it easy and maybe everything isn't so good after all. I need to quit flipping out on people. But I'll probably go crazy trying to live in a hole in the ground in the mountains. I do need people in my life. Just not all the time.
