Seeking Some Feedback On A SituationI would say I have been healing for awhile lately. Last year not sure what happen bit everything holding in cane forward. Thankfully got the help and the support I needed. Also have loving people in my life now.However, maybe three or four times a year I will have an episode. They last no more then a week. It consists of emotions cm rapidly changing, tiredness, irritability, guilt, and few other things.So hit last week due to a lot of external stressor's just building up. Today I did something would never do. I am highly paranoid when driving and feel will get hit by a car at some point. I drive and continue to hear the noise of someone hitting my car on my head it is stressful. So I was in a parking lot turning, but didn't notice a car coming. The driver honked at me when I am in this mood and get startled I get easily agitated. I did something never done or did before I had my window down stopped my car yelled at the driver and swore at the driver. Then drove off I am worried I can get arrested and go to jail for this.Any feedback I appreciate it.
