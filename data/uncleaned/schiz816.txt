I take 75mg invega sustenna injections every 4 weeks for psychosis I had 2 years ago and since have been having trouble sexually, I barely ejaculate anything, it takes longer to get an erection and my orgasm dont feel as good as it used to... My pdoc will be lowering my dose to 50mg and then try Abilify if it doesn't solve my problems so I was wondering if any had any experience with abilify and sexual side effects or opinions on which antipsychotic could help me? Does Abilify have a good chance to solve and return my problems normal like they where before going on invega sustenna? I would like to hear your opinions and experiences. thank you
