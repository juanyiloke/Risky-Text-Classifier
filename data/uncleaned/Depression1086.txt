falling apartI am falling apart, can hardly hold myself together.....I feel like I am breaking and will not be able to be put back together. It's so dark I see no light it's all vanished. I'm scared of what comes next.I am on medication and in therapy but I just feel like this hole I am in is getting deeper and deeper with no way out.....ÊI just don't know what to do anymore....I'm lost.
