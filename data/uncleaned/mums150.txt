DD is nearly 2 and doesn't have any proper hair. She has baby fine hair, hovering around her eyebrows at the front, not much at all at the sides, and covering her neck at the back. Otherwise known as a mullet.

It's all different lengths, and is really scruffy, she always looks really untidy. Pulls out hair ties and hair clips, and barely has enough hair for them anyway.

She is a flower girl in 2 weeks! What am I going to do? Honestly, at the moment it would look like an extra from Annie had stolen a pretty dress and gatecrashed the wedding!
