handling teenagers and getting their support without ruining their social lives¥	Hello out there,¥	Diagnosed a few weeks ago,had Mastectomy two weeks ago. feeling positive and relief after surgery. Will need radiotherapy and chemo in due course. I am a single parent in my 50's with eighteen year old girl. Everyone is being supportive except for my daughter,not  evergot on as well as I would like but currently being really horrible to me and refuses to help at all including walking the dog! She is totally wrapped up in herself and I am still working out whether that is a good thing that she is carrying on as normal or whether she really is being an inconsiderate brat.¥	any advice welcome
