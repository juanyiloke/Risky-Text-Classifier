Transgender menGuys,ÊI'm a Transman. Born anatomically incorrect as female.ÊI've been reading here for years but never felt could partipate because I never really felt/feel man enough I guess.ÊSo what I'm looking to get (honest) opinions on is if you realised a man you know was in fact born female, would you think differently of them? In what way?ÊSame if somebody you know as genically female came out to you as male after you knew them as female for years, would you have trouble accepting it? Like seeing them as one of the lads?
