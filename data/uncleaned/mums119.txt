I just don't know what to do. He keeps on pooing himself. I don't think he's constipated (although when he goes, he does MASSIVE ones) but that he's withholding because he doesn't want to get up and go. He was six in January, has been wee-trained reliably since 2 weeks after his 3rd birthday (as has his brother). They were both - pardon the pun - shitty about shitting and we had a lot of number 2 accidents between age 3 and 5. However, DTS2 has stopped all of that, completely (probably around age 5? It was late), and seems not to get why his brother keeps on doing it. DTS2 also seems to be night trained, whereas his brother still wets 2-3 times a week. We did only start this within the last three weeks as they were both still regularly waking up with saturated pull ups. I only mention this in case people think it is relevant! Also, they were 4 weeks early, no special care. No issues other than speech delay for which they both attend a SALT unit at a local school.We have tried praising and rewarding him when he goes and ignoring the poo. Have tried yelling and withdrawing privileges/toys etc. When smaller, we tried the chocolate button for poos and bubbles in the toilet (I posted at the time but I can't remember where I put or under which username so can't find it, sorry!).I'm just so upset now. Went to put boys to bed about an hour ago, he's pooed himself again. It's not a full on poo, just a nasty skid - but enough that it requires a bath. He was sitting in his room watching Stampy on Youtube . We tried using the tablet as a reason to go to the toilet - but no, even though it is portable he would rather just shit himself and deal with the fallout after.Please can someone offer some help? I just do not know where to go from here. It's so upsetting; it happens at school as well (although not for a while) and I so worry that he's going to end up being the little boy that stinks and has no friends because of it . Thanks in advance if you read this far.
