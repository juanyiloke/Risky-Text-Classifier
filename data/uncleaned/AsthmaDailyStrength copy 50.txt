going to doc today. I smoked for 8 years and have had been having trouble breathing for years now I quit (4 months and 2 days to the day) and it is getting worse and worse. If I go up more than three stairs I have to take a rest. I can't sing to the radio. I get winded talkingsometimes. Last time, the doc gave me a breathing test and insisted I didn't have asthma but the test results were kinda inconclusive. She just insisted it was anxiety because I have an anxiety disorder so I changed and really increased my meds and it didn't help at all! I am only 25 years old. I have a lot of health problems. What could this be?
