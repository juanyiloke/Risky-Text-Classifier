Aftershave spritzer brokenBit of a first world problem here. I have an almost new almost full 125ml bottle of JPG "Le Male". The decking thing fell off the shelf it was on & landed on the spritzer & broke it, so now it doesn't spray any more.It's my go-to signature scent (apart from the incredibly macho musk I naturally have & a half used bottle of sex panther), actually also apart from a bottle of Old Spice which for some reason I also love & use as a day to day one.So... what to do. Is it possible to replace the spritzer ?
