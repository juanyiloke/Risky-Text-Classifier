Haven't Been Here In A While   mellabella , 27 Apr 2015Hi ya'll. I haven't been here in a while but feel the need to come back tonight.... I've been going pretty well. A few down days and anxious moments but I'm really enjoying working in mental health and things are generally going well. Last night though I went out with this guy who I knew had a lot of issues but i felt sorry for him (big mistake!) and he told me all this stuff about his sex life that was really more appropriate for a counsellor and it made me really uncomfortable. Today I told him I didn't want to hang out again and I felt so bad but I'm sick of counselling people in my everyday life. It's really not fair as it's what I do for a living and its not a real friendship if they just want you to be their sounding board. I'm sick of people saying they don't need/want counselling when that is exactly what they're getting from me and it's exhausting. I know it's also up to me to put in boundaries too though. I'm just a bit emotionally depleted today. I had 2 long naps today which is what happened when I'm overwhelmed. And I'm feeling a bit crap about turning 28 in 2 weeks too...
