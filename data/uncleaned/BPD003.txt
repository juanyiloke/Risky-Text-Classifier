Lost,helpless, and aloneby pcglasses » Sun Jun 14, 2015 3:52 amHey, this is my first post and i'm pretty sure it's going to be a long one  . I was diagnosed with BPD early this year, BP before that, and MDD before that. Im halfway in treatment atm and not currently taking any meds.I just feel really helpless and alone. I hate my job because all of my coworkers have turned against me and all talk $#%^ behind my back. I've been in a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship off and on for the last three years and I have no one to talk to outside of him. No friends, no family, nothing. I feel stuck, helpless, and alone.I don't know what to do at this point. Going to work makes me anxious and depressed, but I really need the money even though my money management skills are $#%^ and I haven't saved a penny. Staying at home makes me anxious and depressed because I live alone and I don't have a car or anyone to talk to. I really just want to not be at work or at home, but im broke and ive never been good at making friends. I'm just tired of feeling this way and I don't know what to do about it. Im considering either taking my leftover prescription (abilify and celexa ;as prescribed) or self admitting. I just need a break from life ! I've already had a breakdown at work and I've only been there two months and I feel another one coming. I cant sleep, I cant concentrate, I cant think clearly and my memory is terrible and its really affecting my work which makes me feel worse. I just need a break, maybe start over in a new state, but I feel like my problems will just follow me. I've missed appointments with my psychiatrist and my therapist and I just really need someone to talk to. tl;dr im depressed, helpless, and lonely and I need someone to talk to.
