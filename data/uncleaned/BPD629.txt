I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI am have been diagnosed as with borderline personality disorder last year.Such a relief.I think I have had it for 10 years and have inherited it from my mother.Who I forgive,If she goes through that much emotional pain as me,I forgive her.We tend to bear more than we can actually take.Very few people can love like a borderline person does.And I want to say,to all my BC Cluster personalities I understand, the pain you go though is worse than being impaled forever with a knife stuck to your body.It is worse than being disabled.Short of Alzheimer,cancer and Parkinson,it is probably the worst thing to have.A person who looks particularly sane,but mourns the death of their souls every single day.Do you know the person who created dbt therapy was also a borderline?Please check her story.The person to first go in treatment for borderline was an inspiration,and victim herself.We get a lot of criticism for being horrible monsters,which is so untrue, we are so soft in our hearts.We torment in guilt for our fights,pain we inflict and still burn every time somebody pushes us,which could be anything.And people still want to share their "pain" with us,when every word feels like we are feeling it too.For any person going through what I do,I love you.I sincerely with the bottom of my heart love you,and care about you and feel the same way.I forgive you,as you should forgive yourself.You are a terribly misunderstood human being,and deserve no more pain,cause being you is pain.We are burning in hell-fire of guilt,inadequacy,stress and pain,terrible pain ,and knowing we are bonded by this madness,we will fight our way through.Cause you know,if you master those treacherous emotions and treacherous time lost on those emotions,you are invincible.Death,taxes,and life can come to you,and you will have no fear.We have been through hell,and when we make it through,we will be invincible.I hope to see you and me there.
