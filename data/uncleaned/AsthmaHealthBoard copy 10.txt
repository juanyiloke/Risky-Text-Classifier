Miserable________________________________________A little over a year ago at the age of 25 I was diagnosed with asthma and allergies. I'm desperate for help here. I am on a rescue inhaler, symbicort, singular, and on and off prednisone. I just got off of the steriods after having to have two doses and it was for over a month. Just like always as soon as the steriods run out I get another head cold and my wheezing starts back up. Not to mention being on steriods so much had made me gain a significant amount of weight. I am also currently getting allergy shots because I was tested and allergic to so many things. Cats, dogs, dust mites, mold, pollen, grass, trees, mugwort, cockroaches.... You get the picture. When I am not on steriods my wheezing gets so bad. To the point I can't walk or talk or sleep at night. It's destroying my life and my marriage and makes it extremely difficult to take care of my toddler. I need the steriods again but my doctors don't want to put me on a third dose. I'm at a loss here and becoming extremely dispersed seeing as it's been like I'm sick for over a year. I've done all the things I'm supposed to to decrease allergens in my house. I got the covers for my bedding, we have an air purifier, vacuum and dust daily, (while wearing a dust mask). I've tried the buteyko method of breathing a bit tooI wish I knew there was going to be a light at the end of the tunnel. If anyone has anything at all that I could do or try that I haven't I am willing for just about anything. Thank you.
