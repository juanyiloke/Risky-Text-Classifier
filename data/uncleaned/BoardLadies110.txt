The kindness of strangers.Hello ladies (and gents)ÊSome of you will know that I've been posting in TLL and on Boards for quite a while but this is only one of a handful of times where I've actually started a thread.ÊI had an odd experience last night. An odd one, but quite a nice one nonetheless. I was out having a few drinks with some friends when a girl walked up, sat down beside me and said "You're stunning, but I know you don't believe me..." I was taken aback to say the least. I can't remember what I said, I probably mumbled a "thank you" and blushed!ÊIt actually turned out she knew my friend who was sitting beside me at the time. She then proceeded to tell me that she could see it in my eyes that I'm not confident in myself and told me that I should believe in myself, and that I'm worth a whole lot more than I think. I honestly didn't know what to say. I know she was definitely drunk. But she was right, I doubt myself constantly even though I'm a thousand times more confident than I used to be.So, I suppose my question is this: Has a stranger, or anyone, ever said anything to you that made you stop and think about yourself, or your life in a different way?ÊI really enjoyed myself last night, but I honestly couldn't believe that girl had said those things. She doesn't know me, yet she could say something about me that was 100% correct. She really got me thinking. I'm thinking that maybe I am worth more than I think, maybe things will work out how I want them, maybe I will find what I want in my life, if I just believe in myself that little bit more.Little bit of a random post but I really wanted to share that little story. There are so many negative posts on here, and online in general. I decided to post something positive and see if I can get people to share some of their experiences.
