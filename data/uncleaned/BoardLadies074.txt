Any cut off point for amount of sexual partners your partner had?I was reading a post similar if not identical to this on gc. So what do you ladies think? I'm a virgin so I can't really speak from experience but it wouldn't bother me in the slightest once their clean and healthy. I've been told by a few lads though that they thought girls with more then 2 or 3 were rank! One of my exes told me he was with me because I was the hottest "clean" girl he knew! It's easy to say he wasn't with me much longer!ÊWhat about you ladies? Any preference?
