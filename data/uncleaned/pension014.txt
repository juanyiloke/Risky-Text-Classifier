resusitationWell there's a new novel way of trying to solve the problem of care for the elderly, GPs are going to be encouraged to ask the over 75s do they want to be resuscitated if  ill, I reckon given six months or so if this does not have the desired effect in solving the care problem, Doctors wil then  be given a £50 bonus if they can persuade the patient to agree to no resuss, don't dare come over faint in the surgery if you have agreed. Lol
