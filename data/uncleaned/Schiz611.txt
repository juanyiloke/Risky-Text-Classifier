ÊHackingI put stickers over the cameras on my iPhone because someone could hack my phone and watch me through the camera. They may have already captured pictures of me and have them on the internet. I need to do a thorough search on the Internet.I seen on the news about hackers hacking into baby monitors and spying on the baby and talking through it, so it makes since that they could possibly hack an iPhone. I want to destroy my iPhone and get a basic flip phone because this is too much technology for someone to easily hack.Someone has hacked me before during school. The mouse started moving by itself and clicked on the camera app on the computer. I ran away before they could get my image.This sounds 'crazy', but it's possible. I'm taking extra precautions to save my privacy.Ugh, I feel as if my psychiatrist is going to read my posts on here...I just wanted to share. I feel so much safer with the camera being blocked.Ê
