ÊI am on high alert tonight....I have been hypervigilant my whole life. Tonight, where I live, it is very windy, much like my childhood home was on a regular basis. I think that the wind is making me hypervigilant as I have the wind and abuse mixed up together in my mind. I've been trying to make myself go to bed for a few hours, yet I keep thinking up reasons to still be up. I have a very difficult time sleeping and I think one of the reasons is that I always was listening to see if somebody was coming.
