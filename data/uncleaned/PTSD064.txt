I Stayed CalmI am on an "adventure" this weekend. Time away with my good friend back in the place we went to college together. A quick trip, but I nice change of scenery. It's the first time I have drive alone for any long stretch of time since my car accident in 2012. In total it was probably 4 hours or a little over- I broke it up into two trips on the way down, today I will travel the whole way home in 1 trip.Anyway, the thing I am most proud about other than the driving or maybe most amazed at was that when my friend accidentally hit a curb and popped her tired yesterday (it was not a hard hit, but the curb was granite so it won), I stayed calm. I didn't freak out. I just matter-of-factly asked if she had a spare and we got it out and started reading the manual. Some really nice people tried to stop and help us and were really nice. But the lug nuts (?) were on too tightly that the tools weren't budging them. But I didn't freak out, I remembered my insurance has roadside assistance and even though it wasn't my car, they found someone to come and help (and they came in 10 minutes!). She has to get 2 new tires today (1 to replace the popped one and one so the car will stay balanced), but I am amazed at my calmness through the whole thing.I even drove us to pick up dinner in the dark once we got to the hotel- I hate driving in the dark.I was definitely exhausted at then end of the day, but I am amazed that that moment of calmness. (Earlier, I panicked just walking by a crowd waiting to be seated at a restaurant so staying calm (and using the phone) at the tire incident was hugely amazing. Just thought I would share that since although the tire situation was bad, my calmness was good.
