Afraid of the worstFor the past few weeks I have had a lot of physical issues going on. It all started with some swelling in my neck. From there I was checked for thyroid levels which were all fine. Than I had trouble swallowing and had a barium swallow done, which showed normal swallowing. Than I ended up in the er cuz I hadn't ate and slept in days. They did a ct of my neck, which showed nothing as well as a chest xray which showed nothing as well. I left it alone and forced myself to eat and took Ativan to help me sleep. I have eaten a little and slept a little. Leukemia and esophageal cancer have been ruled out. Because this has caused me so much anxiety I again landed in the er because of facial numbness. I had a dr come in that talked to me for a long time about my mental health because of all of this. She reviewed the tests I had done and assured me I did not have lung cancer. This was all in the er. Other symptoms I have had the last few days include coughing up weird looking stuff (I quit smoking and now have been the last few days cuz of all the stress) the er doc stated a ct of my chest was not necessary and repeated numerous time I did not have lung cancer. I also have been having joint pains in my fingers as well as a month or so ago I always got dizzy when I stood. The facial numbness feels as if it is back today. I also have a swollen lymph node on my neck. The drs say it is benign and did not show on the ct scan as enlarged. All of this is pushing my husband away and I haven't been able to focus on my 3 young kids. I obviously have not been diagnosed with lung cancer and I pray for all of you that are experiencing this. I just need an opinion. Should I deman a ct of my chest or is this all in my head? And has anyone experienced these symptoms?
