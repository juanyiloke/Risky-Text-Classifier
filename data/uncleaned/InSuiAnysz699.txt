I Had A Miscarriage At 5 Months I dont know where to start to be honest I kinda feel stupid thinking like this will change anything my baby girl is still gone. My unexpected beautiful accident. Sometimes I see her face when I look at my partner and it kills me. Its like a piece of u is ripped right out ur boday and whats worse is there is nothing in ur power u can do to stop it. Im greatful that I got to meet my baby before she took her last breath I always use to think to myself all babies are ugly but when I saw my little girl there was not obe bit of her that I didnt like she was just perfect. Her hand were soooo tiny they just wrapped around my fingers and she had the most beautiful smile any mum could wish for and I couldnt do nothing to keep her alive. And I vouldnt hear her cry the one thing I had feared the most was coming true and I couldnt do a damn thing about it. And I find myself trapped finding it hard to breath and finding it hard to live. I know peopke say its gods plan but its a pretty messed up and sucky plan. And some people say it will get better but it doesnt.
