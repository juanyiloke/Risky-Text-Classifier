Anxiety attacks- extreme Ê13    so I suffer with anxiety attacks, they are so bad to the point where I feel numb, extremely numb, the only thing helping me is where I either scratch or bite myself so that I can have a sense of power. My heart pounds, it doesn't stop. I come over all got too. I can't cope anymore, I feel like I'm going to die. I'm 17 years old and I cannot cope any longer, I've tried so much, I'm on medication I attend counselling. I can't keep feeling like this, I honestly feel like I'm not myself, im in a dream. I don't want to die, I need this feeling to stop !!!! Please!!!!!Ê
