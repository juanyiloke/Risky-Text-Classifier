Binge Eating & Bulemic Tendancies - At Wits End!I am at my wits end, I am huge and have no self esteem whatsoever. I'm getting married next year and how can I expect my fiance to love me the way I am, if I don't love myself. I battled with a combination of anorexia and bulemia when I was younger for years and never got myself properly sorted out. Since then I have gone from one extreme to the other I now binge eat but still have the bulemic tendancies. I have tried everything. All my meals I cook are made from scratch, low fat and healthy, but my portion control and secret snacking are undoing all my hard work and I can't seem to stop it. Don't know what to do or where to turn to anymore.
