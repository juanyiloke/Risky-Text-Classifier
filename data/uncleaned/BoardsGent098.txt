clothes for workA young man get his first professional job in which wearing a shirt is the norm, he comes to work in shirt however he appears not to iron his shirts and they are all crumpled. At some point he will have to go to meeting with outside agents and going in a crumpled unironed shirt would not be acceptable at all.If his supervisor says something it could have a similar vibe to giving someone deodorant and might be insensitive, if noting is said the young man might never cop on the fact that its not acceptable to go to work meeting in an unironed shirt.Do you think he should be told outright that he cant come to work in a shirt that is not ironed.
