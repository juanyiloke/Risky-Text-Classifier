Ambition and your career2012-01-31, 08:55 AMOkey, how many of you have had the balls to follow dreams you've semi-planned inside your head for a long time.ÊI'm done with my thesis this year, and got a lot of stuff imagined I will do. Work one or two year in private consulting, buy a flat, move abroad Australia or similar, work in consulting there and get international experience in my field. Then possibly move back at a later stage. And if things look rosy, start my own business.I just wondered whether someone actually had the balls to do what they planned. I'm kinda scared I will fall into a comfort zone and not do what I think is right. Have you managed to push yourself out of that C-Zone? If so, do you regret it? Did it benefit your career?Anyone have stories they wanna share?"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people." Karl Marx
