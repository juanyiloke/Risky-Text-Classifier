Hair thinning :(Hi just wondering if anyone can help me or give me some advice. My hair is extremely thin at the scalp, the root falls flat there is no lift or bounce whatsoever. At the back of my hair where my crease would stop is a patch of very thin hair , actually all the back of my head hair is very thin that you can see my scalp. I cannot leave the house without doing a bit of backcome to make it look fuller. Is there anything I can do to thicken my hair. I know this isn't first world problems but it's seriously depressing me and I feel like my confidence is being sucked outta me.Thanks.
