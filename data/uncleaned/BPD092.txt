Positive Side of Borderline Personality Disorderby debbietoo11 » Mon May 25, 2015 9:27 pmHello everyone! I was just diagnosed with BPD through extensive written, verbal, and computer testing by a neuropsychologist. I was originally diagnosed with depression and ADHD. Currently, I am diagnosed with BPD, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder. My first diagnosis was 10 years ago for depression. SSRI's seem to make me worse. When I started on Vyvanse, my depression lifted and I had a lot more motivation. It also helps with extreme impulsivity. Recently, my Mother died and this triggered my ptsd and/or anxiety symptoms.I knew nothing about BPD, except what I saw in movies and they were mostly negative examples. When I read about the symptoms, it was like reading the story of my life! I am so glad I know what I actually have now and that it's not all my fault. I severely abused alcohol before getting on meds, and this caused huge job loss and homelessness. Filed for disability last May and SSA is now at the point of making a decision. I think I have a good chance since I just turned 60.After doing a lot of research, I found that borderlines are actually gifted in the areas of "personal intelligence" and/or intuition in their ability to sense another's moods. I have always noticed this about myself, as well as my intense emotions! My Mother was cold, distant, unempathetic toward my feelings, and extremely invalidating. None of us children ever remember one time when she openly showed affection toward us. I believe she had narcissistic personality disorder now. Anyway, just google BPD and intuition, and you will find a bunch of articles.I am so glad I found this board and have other people who I can relate to.
