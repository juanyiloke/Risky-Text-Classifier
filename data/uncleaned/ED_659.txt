Scary weekend and sore throat!This weekend I had a friend stay with me who basically eats a lot. She's overweight and makes me feel guilty for being a 'normal' weight and for losing weight when she is unable to.She put pressure on me to eat with her and made me feel quite guilty for not wanting take outs and junk food... Over the course of the weekend I did eat bits of junk food with her to keep her happy and also ate some Chinese takeaway. The long and short of it is that I purged quite a lot this weekend. I'd been doing so well and had really cut down on binging and purging so I'm a bit disappointed.I've been restricting quite a lot recently and have managed to lose weight which I'm happy with, but feel like eating all of that crap has really set me back. I can't stop thinking about it. Plus the fact that it's stretched my stomach and since then I feel a bit hungrier, so today I ate more than usual, which I'm struggling with as I'm unable to purge today because my throat hurts so much. It really hurts to swallow, it sort of stings constantly. I'm not sure what I can do to relieve the pain. Any ideas?I'm not sure what I want from this thread really, bar some ideas to soothe my throat. I'm just struggling and needed to put it out there. To get it out of my head.I probably don't deserve any support because I should know better, but I'm just feeling a bit sorry for myself right now.
