Life feels like an ocean and that I just got trapped in a current that won't seem to let me go. I was raised by my mother and an emotionally abusive step-dad. I am now 18 and although my mother has long since divorced him, I feel worse now than I ever did before. From my mother constantly making me look like a fool in front of my younger siblings to my depression that seemed to appear once one of my friends was murdered two years ago. I have been hospitalized 3 times for suicidal idealization and 2 times for suicide attempts. I feel so alone and I just don't know what to do anymore. I keep getting my heartbroken and I have already lost people I thought were friends because of my hospital crap. Just writing this I feel so hopeless.
