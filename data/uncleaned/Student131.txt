How do you organise your lectures notes/reading/revision?by LegWeakstill trying to find the best strategy! currently I write notes in the lecture, then go home and re-write them using the online lecture slides, then do reading, from which I take notes, and have all the info divided into topics in ringbinders HOWEVER having found this not particularly effective, I'm thinking I might start printing off the lecture slides and annotating them in the lecture then doing the reccomended reading, and then I can make a summary sheet of the topic at the end of each week or when best fits...Just interested to see how everyone else does it and what you've found effective as it's caused me trouble all year!
