Why are there no free cancer screening for men?In so many places, there are free breast exams (don't get me wrong), it's a great initiative.ÊThere are also free smear tests available from so many GPs.ÊWhy are there no free initiatives available for prostate and testicular cancer? Why is there so little publicity into these cancers?Why can't men go to these free breast clinics too? Men CAN and have gotten breast cancer. Especially more, "well-endowed", men who are over weight / have men boobs.Curious what people think.
