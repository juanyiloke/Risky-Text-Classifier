Azythromycin Hey guys,I have been on Azithromycin for a while, they were cautious due to a slightly elongated QTC. THey did lots of different ECGs when I first started it and my heart was ok. They then changed my dose from 250mg to 500mg when they knew my heart was coping. I currently take on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I have noticed though that the second day (Days I dont take it) that my asthma deteriorates and on a Sunday I am housebound and the asthma is terrible. My blood results on it are better. Would it be worth seeing if I could take 250mg daily rather than 500 3x a week I wonder? Thanks, Laura x
