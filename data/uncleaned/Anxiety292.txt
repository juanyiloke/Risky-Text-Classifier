Scared I have PCI will be 32 in a couple of months and am deeply afraid I have pancreatic cancer. For a week now, I have had suddennausea, diarrhea which now turned into soft stools that FLOAT, loss of appetite, extreme gas and overwhelming fatigue. The fatigue has been there for awhile now. I cant get in to the Dr for 2 more weeks! I saw a NP cause I am terrified and she just did bloodwork, which was 2 days ago and havent heard anything. I have 2 kids under age 2 that I am the only caretaker for. I have no support system and no one to help me right now. I am at my wits end, I have been crying all day! I cant even function cause of the fatigue and have 2 little ones to look after. Any suggestions?? And btw a year ago I had an ultrasound while I was pregnant, they said I had a polyp in my gallbladder which at first they said was a gallstone. This hospital is not very good at diagnosing which scares me more. I now am having all these symptoms and just am overwhelming terrified! I can barely eat or function, how do I wait 2 weeks for a Drs appointment? I am sorry for coming on here but since I have no one around me, I have no one to vent to. I dont normally freak out about things, but I am just so ill with the same symptoms!
