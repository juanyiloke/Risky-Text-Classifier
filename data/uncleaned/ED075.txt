I'm a bulimic and my father's septic tank starting leaking, I'm scared it's my fault PLEASE HELP MEHello, I'm really scared right now. I have been a bulimic for seven years and have not told a soul… I am actually in an AA recovery program right now and trying to work on everything I can. Working on my eating disorder is something I will be discussing with my sponsor in Step 4 (which is the step where you admit all of the secrets, lies, resentments, and losses you have felt in life).Anyway- I have been living with my father for a little over a month now and I have been purging about once a day into the toilet. He found excess water coming from the septic tank today and he is having someone examine it within the next few days. I am ready to work on this problem, more than ever, but I don't want this to be the way they have to find out. I am finally working on myself and getting myself healthy in all aspects and I'm just so scared this is how it's going to go down.Is it possible the guy coming to check out the problem will see it's from vomit? Would a month of vomiting be enough to make this happen? Is there any advice someone can give me on a way to avoid this matter? I know lying isn't something I want to do-- but I'm not sure I can handle this mortifying experience and I just want to be able to work this out through choosing to go into a recovery program and finally admitting to my father and closest loved ones what I've been putting myself through over the years in my own way.If anyone can help in any way, I'm desperate and really scared. Thank you guys.
