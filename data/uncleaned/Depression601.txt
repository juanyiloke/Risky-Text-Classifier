 Feeling like absolute crapStarted by Joe?, Yesterday 10:27 PMHiya, been here before but not felt this bad for a very long time. Basically this week I'm on holiday from work, not gone away anywhere, just not working and it's my birthday today. Since I've started my holiday I have just gone downhill, the first day I was off I just spent in bed, sleeping which I thought nothing of, just thought ok one day in bed, maybe I'm just tired. Anyway I haven't been getting out of bed until about 2-3pm all week now, I keep meaning to get up early but I just can't. Yesterday for the first time in ages I ended up cutting myself on my arm and my leg while I was in bed which to be honest felt good, I ain't gonna lie. Today like I said was/is my birthday and I've just got in from a nice evening out but I didn't enjoy myself at all, felt no enjoyment. I'm 25 and I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis so every step is painful, I am being treated for depression and have been for a while, I'm on a combination of medication which includes Mirtazapine, Amitriptyline and Trazadone. Also my wounds are clean and I have covered them.
