ÊSecond visit to the therapistToday was the second visit to my therapist. She is from the hospital where I receive treatment. She is so pushy. She kept talking and talking and talking and talking and OMG talking. She kept saying grounding techniques and this and that.I told her I have tried those things 100s of times and never work during my emotional flashbacks/panic attacks. But she kept pushing to try more. Very frustrating. I hate therapists like that.Btw she is MSW RSW. So I am guessing and am pretty sure she doesn't have training in trauma treatment. So that is why she is pushy with the grounding techniques.But after talking I didn't even get to talk about the trauma itself because she was talking so much.ÊAnd also I did not get to tell her that besides the emotional flashbacks/panic attacks I also seem detached from myself. I used to have a connection to my gut before but now I don't feel that connection. I am all up here.. in the mind. And it is exhausting. I am in my mind all the time 24/7 and no gut connection or feeling from the gut. I am detached from myself in a way.I don't know if anyone else feels this way but I feel like after the traumatic incidents 3-4 yrs ago I have been dumbed down and there is no gut connection in my body and I am all up in my mind all the time and it is exhausting and painful.
