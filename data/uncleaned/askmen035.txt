A guy at work isn't following convention...2014-02-04, 06:45 AMOk, I work for the IT department in a company. We use a methodology called Agile for our development. This company has a set of coding conventions and standards that the developers are supposed to follow.Well, a co-worker was telling me about a guy on a different team (but we're working on the same project) who isn't following convention. For the last month or so he's questioned why things are done the way they are, been more interested in other things than doing his work (which has gotten him a couple of days behind), like looking at the code for a framework, etc.Well, recently he created two completely unnecessary files. We already have the files he needed to add his code to, he just arbitrarily decided to create these two new ones.My co-worker and I were trying to figure out what to do. Apparently, the team lead really likes this guy (let's call him Tom), because he, according to co-worker, "worships" the team lead.Anyway, my co-worker and I are trying to figure out what to do. This could result in some eventual re-writing of code, which could theoretically put us behind schedule.Neither of us is sure what to do. My wife just suggested continuing to "give him rope", as it were. She advised against going over the team lead's head to the manager.So should we say anything or just let this be?Work for your reputation, so your reputation can work for you.
