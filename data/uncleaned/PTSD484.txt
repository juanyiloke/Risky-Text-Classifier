ÊMy new EMDR therapists doesn't use eye movements. Problem?Hi everyone,This is my first post. So the subject pretty much sums up my question. I've had a few sessions with a new therapist trained in EMDR. We have only actually used bilateral stimulation during less than half of these sessions via physical tapping and also via her TheraTapper device which works through physical vibrations.I am trying to stay opened-minded and realistic about the process, but one thing that is nagging at me is the fact that this therapist has yet to integrate actual eye movements as part of the processing. I understand that bilateral stimulation can be achieved via touch or sound, but I was under the impression that those methods are generally reserved for situations where eye movement is impractical, such as when the patient is visually impaired.Can anyone trained in EMDR or with more knowledge about EMDR than I speak to this? From what I read on the EMDR Institute website, it sounds like the eye movements may be significant, while not critical, to the efficacy of treatment. Thanks in advance.
