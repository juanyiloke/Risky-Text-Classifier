Occupation: married womanNow here's something that seems to come from Dev's Ireland...When you register as a director of a company / charity at the Companies Registration Office, you have to fill in some details - including your occupation, which you pick from a list.ÊAs you'll see from the image, you can select 'Married woman' as your occupation. Note that while you can select married woman twice, you can't select single woman, married man or single man.ÊTo my simple mind this is bullsh1t. Anyone like to suggest to whom I might write, to get this changed?ÊOr are there any married loungers out there who see being married as an occupation?Ê
