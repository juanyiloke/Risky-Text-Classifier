A Big Thank You...Since arriving here 5 weeks ago, lost, scared and In a dark place after being warned about complications and given practically zero information, you folks have given me the confidence, control and knowledge to shed my fear, I'm starting to feel like my old self again, only 2 stone lighter, more energised and optimistic about my future.I fired off heaps of questions when I first arrived and no one complained, not once. I see the same experienced big hitters giving the same advice daily to others with the same compassion, day after day.You know who you are,Thank youDaksGonna Fly Now - HbA1cHey folks,So it's been 3 months since I walked in the door with a raging BG HbA1c of101mmol/mol, feeling weak, depressed, upset and at that point had resined myself to a future of ill health, complications and a shortened life expectancy of 10 years, all based on information presented by the NHS.Only 3 Months later my HbA1c has just come in at 41mmol/mol I have dropped a little over 3 stones in weight, attend gym 4 days a week and have accepted that my health and life expectancy is now likely going to be many years more than had I not been diagnosed with diabetes. This is testament to good information, community support , fact based data and a great bunch of people that prompted a lifestyle change.Thank you all so much.Daks
