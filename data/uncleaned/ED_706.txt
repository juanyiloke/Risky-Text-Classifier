New here...dietician questionThis is my first post here, so I will give a little background on myself. I would say I've had eating 'issues' since middle school (I'm now 33 y/o). I've had 3 or 4 more drastic boughts of weight loss in that time, but none I've seen a doctor for and none quite like I'm experiencing now. I am a perfectionist in every aspect of my life and don't see me ever being happy or comfortable with my body. I just completed my first semester of graduate school and my current issues began when I started school. I played off my initial restricting/weight loss as due to stress of school, while working full time and taking care of my kids. My husband was concerned and kind of forced me to see a counselor at my school. I've seen him about 4 times now, but the first couple sessions were useless, as he knew I didn't want to be there and I wasn't adding too much to the sessions. Our last session went much better and I was able to open up a big more. I'm at the point now where some days I can admit I have a problem, but I'm having difficulty taking that next step of doing something about it. My counselor has recommended I see a dietician, but I told him I wanted to wait until after my winter break to see if I could manage on my own without the stress of school. Since I relate my trigger to the stress of school I thought that a month off between semesters would "fix" me, but it hasn't gotten any better. In a way it has gotten worse, because now I actually have time to exercise daily, but I'm still consuming very low calories. I work in the medical field and know the risks and I know what I should be eating. I am not sure how a dietician will help me, because I know what I should be eating...I can write up a meal plan...I just don't (can't) follow it. Do you think a dietician would be beneficial at this time? Won't they just tell me what I already know?
