Patient Information BookletsI had an outpatient appointment on Friday last week during the course of which I thanked the nurse specialist for giving me a range of appropriate BCC publications and recommending me to the site. She told me that the BBC publications are the only ones they use now because they are excellent and patient feedback has been first-rate. I'm sure the team know this already, but there is no harm in a public 'pat on the back', now is there? Keep up the good work people and in the busy days ahead, remember that your input is appreciated and making a difference to so many lives. B
