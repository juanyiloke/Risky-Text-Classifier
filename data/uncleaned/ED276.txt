ÊI think I'm starting to become too afraid to eat now....I'm in the airport now waiting to fly home and today I noticed I'm starting to become afraid to eat because then I'll get "fat". I know I've lost weight this trip because of how my pants feels at the waist. What made me realize that I am becoming afraid to eat is that eating an orange made me feel fat. And I'm talking about only ONE orange. I even felt that eating it would make me fat. I haven't purged but it wouldn't surprise me if I started soon. I think I'm SO lonely now that I'm willing to force myself to lose weight by purging will make people like me and NOT abandon me. I am scared now. Please help me!
