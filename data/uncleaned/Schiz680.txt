ÊMy beliefs:I just thought it would be a fun thing to tell you guys what I believe in and see if anyone else believes in anything similar (I'm atheist, so not religious tho).1. I believe in rebirth. I believe that the voices and people inside of me are the souls of a former me. The more times I've died and come back, the more souls there will be, all of them trapped in the same body.2. I believe in ghosts. Not like those ghost you see in movies, rather poor souls trapped in this world, unable to move on and find peace.Ê3. I believe in invisible creatures. I'm often terrified to be alone outdoors in case one of them would kidnap me because no one would be able to see that as they're invisible.4. I often start doubting that I'm the "original", like that I'm not living in my own body. I feel like I'm just a soul trapped inside someone else's body.Ê5. I also often doubt that we're controlling our own bodies. It often feels like we were all placed on this planet for experimental purposes only. Or that it's all a simulation. That really there is nothing called Earth or humanity of animals. Someone just makes us believe there is. They also made us believe we have a history when really we might just as well have started this simulation yesterday and all our memories are just made up.Ps, I'm sorry if any of this was confusing in any how.
