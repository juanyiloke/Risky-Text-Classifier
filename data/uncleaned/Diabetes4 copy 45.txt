Update...HiThis is the thread I posted on day 1 - http://diabetes-support.org.uk/diabetes_forum/index.php/topic,5489.0.htmlIts been 3 weeks now and I thought I should just post an update. I am doing fairly well on the meter. I am testing where possible and usually after a new meal I added, I test a few times. I am keeping under 7.5 most meals. My typical diet now is:1st thing in the morning - soaked fenugreek seeds & soaked almondsBreakfast - tomato juice (homemade) with protein powder                  OR   sproutsNo snack at 10:30 am. That is a big shift for my body and I am doing not too bad 12 noon - Lunch - small salad or soup(home made and usually lentils) with a vegetable pancake3ish  - cheese or blueberries+greek yogurt or just herbal tea or full fat flat white from Nerodinner - I sometimes skip it or I have salad + spinach and tomato soupLast thing at night - cheeseI have been walking about an hour every day - usually broken into 2-3 walking sessions.. Taking the stairs etcI have lost about 3.5 kgs in these 3 weeks. Its not easy, but somehow its easier than I thought it will beThanks againCIDI
