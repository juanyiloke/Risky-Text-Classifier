I am 22 years old, and i had the best relationship with my mother. She was my best friend, we did almost everything together and i love her more than anything else in this world. December 2008 i was kidnapped by 3 hispanic men who held me for ransom. I was held for 12 hours. They made 3 ransom calls to my mom, and i got to talk to her twice. Since my kidnapping almost a year now. My relationship with my mom is now heartbreaking. We always are disagreeing, fighting, argueing, and i can barely be around her, and at the same time i miss her so much it hurts. I live close by so i see her almost every day. I dont know what to do i miss my mom but i just feel like i cant talk to her anymore. Any advice?
