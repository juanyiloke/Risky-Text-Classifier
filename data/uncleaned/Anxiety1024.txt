Chronic clenching of groin musclesOK, so I wasn't sure how to make a subject out of this. I have noticed for the past 10 years or so that, because of my anxiety, I chronically clench my "groin area". By which I mean it seems like I'm always actively, but unconsciously, clenching my anus and 'kegel' muscles. When I become aware of this I can relax them but the tension gradually returns as my awareness goes elsewhere.I am worried that the chronic kegel manuver is affecting blood flow down there. Also my penis and testicles are almost constantly retracted, unless I have taken my antianxiety meds.I've been working on focused relaxtion, but I don't feel it's effective as my anxiety is not completely under control.I know this is a no brainer as to cause and effect. Just wondering if anyone else, male or female, experiences this?
