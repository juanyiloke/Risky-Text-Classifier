The Truth About FatI'm hoping by now most of us have watched this BBC documentary, I did see DeeJayR started a thread about fat In blood but the science on that thread hurt my brain, so I was hoping to restart this discussion and see what the general consensuses is of the experiments that were carried out, in a more layman's fashion.Needless to say the docu was / is the be all and end all of what is wrong and right, but it certainly played out legit. It was comforting for me personally to know that the LCHF has received a thumbs up in that being afraid of the big bad fat monster is wrong and in fact we should all be eating the right fats, including some forms of saturated fats which are good for us, particularly those found in dairy produce.Do you think the docu was a step in the right direction ?
