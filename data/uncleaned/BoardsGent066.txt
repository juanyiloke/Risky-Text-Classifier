Is the fear of Paedophilia preventing positive male role models?I was thinking about this. There's definitely a culture nowadays of suspicion towards men that they might be paedophiles, even when there's absolutely no evidence to suggest so. It's quite a prejudice really, though one expressed by both sexes.I know myself, I'd be very wary of being in a position where I'm alone with kids, lest there be any misunderstandings or false accusations, because when rumours start, even if they're completely unfounded, you're screwed. And speaking to other people, I'm far from being alone in feeling this way.And it filters down. Men are becoming discouraged from volunteering to coach sports teams or teaching in primary schools, which is really sad. But more worrying is the fact that there are whole generations of kids growing up with very little meaningful interaction with adult men outside of their family.I live in an area with a lot of gang violence among teenage boys. The absence or lack of involvement of a father being a nearly universal factor in common, and I wonder if the lack of male role models outside of their family is a contributing factor.Obviously there do need to be some safeguards, and the stories of abuse in past decades are horrific, but I think the whole current atmosphere has gone too far, towards the realm of hysteria, and is in fact doing more harm than good.What are people's thoughts?
