ClinicsWhat a week I have infront of me. Monday hospital for toe. Tuesday diabetic clinic for the dreaded HbA1c results. Friday gp's appointment. I will be very glad when tomorrow, seeing consultant about what to do about my toe infection. Hb refuses to come with me as he says the hospital is only a couple of miles away and I drive, I can't get him to see I need him for support. I have recently been having terrible panic attacks but he just says take a pill you will be ok then. Gp prescribed diazapam for really bad attacks. I very rarely take one as I try and get through it on my own. I am terrified of losing my toe. I will let you all know how I got on when I get home tomorrow.
