what makes you approach person?Just wondering what catches your eye on a night out and makes you approach someone? Question is borne from a male friend of mine who said he wouldnt approach me on a night out as I seem intimidating, which floored me tbh!On nights out im there primarily to have the craic with my friends or whoever I end up talking to. I dont hang round in large groups and I would always be smiling or laughing so I dont look grumpy, but I rarely get approached. This made me feel like I was clearly unappealing looking, but he said I look unapproachable. I dont really do the whole scanning the room looking for targets as I see other girls at thatand tbh that to me looks predatory! But now Im wondering if I should be doing this? I have approached men myself on nights out but I just wonder if im missing that 'wow' factor that captures attention on nights out that makes men approach.....or maybe Im just a munter  Is looks really all it is?
