New KneesPleased to say that I'm going to have a new left knee on Tuesday November 25th 2014. I've had arthritic knees for 12 years and have been told repeatedly by the NHS (GPs and surgeons) that I was too young for replacement, even last year that was the message.It's true that I'm having it done privately, but even the last private consultant said I was too heavy and I have lost 3 st, thanks to low carbs. What annoyed me about him was that he could have told me that before he got his money for the x-rays and consultation. Because I forgot to ask at the first consultation, when I phoned 2 days later I was advised to make another appointment at £195. I should coco. You live and learn!I learned a new medical term, I thought my knees were knackered, the surgeon tells me that they are totally buggered and he will be pleased to replace them so that I can get a bit of normal life before I finally pop my clogs. He even said that he and a colleague in Australia where he worked for a while used to do both at the same time, one on each knee. We don't do that in the UK but depending on the outcome, he'd consider the second one to be done in 3 months, fingers crossed, let's see how it goes. I even said my ambition was to get back on skis and he didn't even flinch, in fact thought the Nordic-track cross country skis were very good exercise machines for post surgery. Happy chappy today, I hope nobody is going to ruin that. LOL
