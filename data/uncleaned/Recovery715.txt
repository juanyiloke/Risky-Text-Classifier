I think I'm getting there... First time on here.I've been fighting since I was 15. I think I'm getting there now.15 years. I know it sounds like a long time but it has been a very gradual process, getting better and stronger as the years added up. Plus I don't feel nearly thirty!!!!what was the thing that helped most in getting me out of the darkness? Actually wanting help and being determined to do what I had to do. Medication AND therapy! Not one or the other. What helped was finding a psychologist I felt understood and was invested in helping me.you wouldn't think to look at me now, I have a very good job and just got a promotion, I'm educated, building my own house, I have friends and family that I love and who love me.but it wasn't always that way and I don't think it will ever truly be over. I just made a choice...and I chose to do the hard work. What you think is so powerful, it doesn't have to be real though, you can choose to entertain a thought. I didn't realise this for a long time, then I took me even longer to actually gain control over them. They still creep in. I thought getting on here and sharing  would help me and maybe, by chance help someone elseim happy to talk more about my experience. My lowest times. How I got through them. Like the rain app!! It's just an app for that plays the sound of rain, it still helps me when my mind won't stop.
