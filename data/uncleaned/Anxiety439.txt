Do you think that telling an anxiety suffererTo just "let an attack happen", and "don't fight it", " you'll get used to the feeling", is like telling a victim of abuse "just let the beating happen, you'll get used to the pain."Or someone with asthma, "just let yourself have an attack, you'll get used to gasping for breath".I realize ppl recommend this with good intentions, thinking if you have an attack, you will fear it less, but it doesn't work that way.When I'm in an anxious state and vulnerable to a panic attack, I feel as if the panic is the equivalent of someone holding a whip over me, waiting to lash my back, and I prefer to distract myself from it happening rather than have the bloody stings of the whip come down on me.ÊI'm never going to embrace panicked feelings.Now, I HAVE let myself go into a full blown attack years ago, when I didn't know how to manage, I felt the terror, and I felt better after the attack..thought I defeated the anxiety, but I hadnt, i still didn't know why I was feeling this way, but having the attack didn't improve things.
