Forced annual leave?________________________________________Hi, started a new job a couple of months ago and I've just been informed that the company closes over Christmas so I must take 4 days out of my annual leave because of this.I don't have a contract (long story, they are useless at anything HR/ Admin related) so I was not aware of this requirement before starting work. I'd prefer not to use 4 days of my precious 20 days - can they force me to take the time off? What if I was Jewish or Muslim and didn't celebrate Christmas? Seems a bit unenforceable to me! Is this legal?
