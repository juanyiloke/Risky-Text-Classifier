Going commando after work outI go to a gym regularly and have noticed off late that most of the guys in the changing room after work out put on their tracks or jeans after a shower without any underwear. Is this a new phenomenon only in my gym in Sandyford or does this happen across all the gyms in Dublin??I am not passing any judgements just curious!!!!
