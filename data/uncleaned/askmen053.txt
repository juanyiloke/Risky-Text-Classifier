Negotiating Salary within a range (Minimum/Midpoint/Maximum)2013-08-19, 10:28 AMI have an interview situation coming up where salary may be discussed.ÊI found out the salary grade of the position and what the minimum, midpoint, and maximum amounts are.My question is where would one (seriously) place themselves along that range when giving the hiring manager an expected salary figure? In other words, who would I know if I fit around the mid point level, give or take a few dollars? Or if I am selling myself short and based on my experience, should I be looking toward the upper range?ÊBelow is an example (not the real range) to work with.I satisfy all of the qualifications of the job, maybe even over qualify. But I am currently a temporary contractor who;d been working with the company since January.Would somewhere between the Mid and max ($67,500) be a fair number to start with? Thanks!!!!
