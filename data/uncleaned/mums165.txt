Odd question I know and it isn't as though I'm not happily married...I'm pregnant and due to work circumstances the DH will be away working abroad pretty much straight after DC1 is born... am here in the UK as here are my parents and friends nearish, but nowhere to live in the other country with the DH being a nomadic worker. I returned because we were living out of the back of a car for over 6 months and no money to buy a caravan/motorhome.ÊHe is coming to the UK for the birth and then heading off again days later.My biggest concern is that will the DH and DC bond?ÊThe next issue is am I able to cope raising DC almost on my own??ÊIt is a little bit like having a partner in the forces, except with no leave!!!ÊHas anybody been in a similar situation? Anyone have any advice??
