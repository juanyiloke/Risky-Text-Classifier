Why is this so difficult?This all started about two years ago. I skipped meals here and there as a teenager but as an adult I found freedom and I don't know if maybe all the freedom was overwhelming because of the strict home I grew up in or what. In that freedom I've quickly found myself in my own prison. I can't escape the constant thought of food and my weight. I use to find power and strength from denying my body of what it needs and felt completely in control. I know this is dangerous and I thought I had control but I can't stop. I hate the constant battle that is going on in my head. It's an eating disorder, it's not an eating disorder, I'm overreacting, I'm fine, this is going to kill me, I need help, I can do this on my own, say something, don't ever say a word. I've set up an appointment for counseling at the end of the month. Now along with obsessing over food I'm also anxious about this appointment. I don't know what to expect and am terrified. Why can't I let go of something that makes me feel miserable? I'm keeping secrets from my husband trying to hide this and there's no way I'll ever be someone my daughter can look up to if I keep this up. I have a feeling this will be the start of something really great but I also feel like I'm giving up on my own ability to stand on my own and have control over my life. I feel if I stay on the path I'm on I'll never be able to stop. I constantly want to cancel my appointment and not deal with this. I've opened up to a friend that's like a mom to me and I've only made this appointment because of her. Is counseling really going to be effective if I'm not doing this for myself? I don't feel receptive or open to change or new coping methods. I know I need to address this now but I would rather let this spiral out of control. Any suggestions, advice, and opinions are appreciated.
