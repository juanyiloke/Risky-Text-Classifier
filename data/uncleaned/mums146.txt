I have a 10 year old son from a previous relationship, I had him at age 18 so only 28 now.ÊMyself and my DP have always talked about having a baby together, (he has children that are even older than my ds) and i do get broody.On the the other hand, now that ds is 10 he can entertain himself, is gaining independence, my house is generally tidy and clean, I have decent amounts of me time as ds shares his time between myself and his dad equally.....I'm a bit apprehensive about going back to the baby days again and everything that it involves!! I felt more up for parenting and being devoted to a tiny person 24/7 when I was 18 than I do now. I feel I have had the selfish/not ready feelings in reverse!ÊHas anyone had a large age gap between kids and did it work out ok?
