I am new to this.¥	Hi everyone, I was diagnosed on 10th December with invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2. 1st OP was 29 Dec, they removed the tumour as well as one cancers node, second OP was 9th February for clearance of margins, I oped out of axillary node clearance because it was agreed that radiotherapy afterwards will have the same results (more or less). However afterwards I was told I had to have mastectomy as they had found other smaller tumours in the clearance, I must admit I was knocked for six. But my confusion comes from meeting the oncologist yesterday, I thought that everyone who has had mastectomy will automatically have chemo followed by radio. The oncologist could not give me a clear guidance about going forward with further treatment. She showed me the Stats, and thought as I did not have the axillary clearance, I fall into a grey category which means I can choose either way. Go with Chemo then radio or go radiotherapy, but the decision is mine!  I can't stop thinking of what I should do. Has anyone had similar experience.  any advise much appreciated.
