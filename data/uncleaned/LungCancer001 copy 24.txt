Tumor foundI have a tumor in my lung and will be having tests over the next couple of days. I am having biopsy, MRI and bone scan. Aparts from my shoulder aching and back and hip ache I am fine in every other way. I have a slight cough but nothing that is producing anything. I have a good appetite too good actually and I am not tired in anyway. In my experience, the pain usually starts when it has spread so, shouldn't I be feeling ill?Do I also have a good chance of surviving this?
