Hellby Sickmonkey » Thu Nov 20, 2014 10:54 pmHello all, first time poster here. I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and I wanted to get some feed back from other sufferers. No one in my family or circle of friends has suffered from this so I have no outlet save for my therapist. I recently tried to take my own life by jumping off of a balcony and sense then I have been hearing a voice which has been telling me 24/7 that I didn't survive the jump, Even as I type this now it is telling my that I am dead and in hell and that everyone around me is an impostor. It is relentless in its message "you are not among the living" "you are in a bad place" "you are in hell" This voice can come from anything from foot steps to the TV to music and even the water in the shower and a dogs barking. Some days I really do believe I died. My therapist has told me that otherwise but the voice or voices sound so complex in their conversation and vocabulary that I can't believe this is my own brain doing this to me. The only visual hallucination a saw was a bright light when I was in the hospital and that's about when the voices started. Every second of every day they talk to me and for a while I really did believe I was in hell. I wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with voices this strong and complex before. Before they told me I was in hell they told me the world was an artificial simulation and that I was being taken out because I figured it out so the voices drove me to jump off in the first place. They constantly argue with me and I can't even hug my own mother without hearing them say "she is not your real mother you real mother has no son anymore" some other things they say are "you do not have schizophrenia" the medicine will not work" "you are not supposed to be here" 24/7. The only time I get a break is in my sleep and they effect my dreams too. Help me!
