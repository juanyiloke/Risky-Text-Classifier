ÊAnxiety and sleep.Hi everyone,ÊI've only really developed anxiety in the past few weeks. My anxiety is really effecting my sleep, its making me feel as though if i sleep i am not safe. So part of me wants to sleep because its tired but the other part says no! I've always got a constant conflict going on in my head, and my emotions are all over the place. I start to feel sick with anxiety as the evening approaches. I live with a friend so i know that i am not alone in the house and usually this makes me feel safe, but when he is not here i get really panicky. But now i feel panicky going to bed even when he is here! Has anyone else felt like this and can relate? I feel like i'm weird!ÊThanks!
