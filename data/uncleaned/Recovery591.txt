  Getting there, slowly.I'm not fully recoverd, but I can say I'm deffinatly feeling better .I've learnt how to deal with what my brain gives out, its hard but I wont let it beat me.9 years of hiding away and seeing life as pointless, what a waste of precious time! Life is what you make it, I'd made it shit so obviously it was going to turn out that way.I feel so free, like I can just do what I like when I please with out battling with the demons every time!I still got a lot of shit to deal with, I'm waiting for a psychiatrist. I need a lot of help with my self esteem and confidence. After that I think the world is pretty  much mine. I cannot wait for that day.There isn't MAJOUR change in my life, I'm just a lot more positive and don't over think everything I do.I still don't have a job, but that will come in time.I am driving again, should have a car in a couple months time... more freedom! I have been out almost everyday, doing different things. Its so nicee, I even went to centrl London twice last week. I wanted to go home when I got there though, all the big crowds and tourists! But I got through it and didn't let my brain win.I had to sit on a loooong train journey alone... panic attack  wanted to kick in, but I told it to fuck off :)I still have a long way to go but the positive thinking is working wonders. And thehot weather  too I think :) I hope everyone else is okay ?! Just thought I'd share something nice for a change. Mwah x
