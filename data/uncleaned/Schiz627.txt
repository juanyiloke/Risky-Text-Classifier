ÊWhy won't my mom listen to me?I've told my mom many times that I'm havong hallucinations but she won't listen to me !!! I hear things, see things, feel things crawling on me and sometimes smell odd odors that no one else does! I feel really helpless and she said she would take me to a doctoe but that was almost 4 weeks ago! Even a 6 months before, a counsler called her and told her I was cutting a depressed and she said I was lying about it !!!!!! She won't ever listen to me and it's very, very annoying. I just really need help but she gets mad whenever I tell someone.ÊHelp?
