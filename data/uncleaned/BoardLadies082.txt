Ethical ShoppingTo what extent do ethics or values shape how you shop?For example: I am lactose intolerant and I luuuurve almond milk. But almond production is both hugely water intensive (in drought-stricken California, where something like 80% of almonds are grown) and almond monoculture has been fingered, at least in part, to the collapse of bee colonies. So I increasingly feel like I should give it up, especially as I am trying to be more conscious about sustainable agriculture.ÊThat said, sometimes I feel like EVERYTHING is bad for the earth/the air/poor workers in far-flung countries/you (and the 'good' stuff can be quite expensive!') so I guess there are tradeoffs. How, if at all, do you make those tradeoffs?
