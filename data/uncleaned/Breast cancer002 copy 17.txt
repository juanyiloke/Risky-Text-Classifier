Just crossed the finish line¥	Well it was a long hard road but today I had my last radiotherapy treatment and crossed the finish line! I have been through a lot and learnt an awful lot about breast cancer along the way. After diagnosis last July it's been (nearly) a year from hell but after experiencing every emotion there is I feel proud of myself for getting through it. I've been so lucky to have had brilliant support from my lovely hubby, family, friends and work, without which I could never have coped.¥	I know my fight will continue with the letrazole for 5+ years, the trauma of yearly mammograms and the fear of the b#Û$%´d returning but for now I'm allowing myself a well earned WOOHOO!¥	Thanks to everyone on this forum for your help, advice and humour. It is invaluable knowing we aren't fighting this alone. Xxx
