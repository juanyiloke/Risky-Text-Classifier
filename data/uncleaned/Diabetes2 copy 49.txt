Duloxetine 60mg capsules (Cymbalta)  8  First of all I am not diabetic but I do need help on the above tablet Duloxetine (Cymbalta) which I believe is given to diabetics for pain relief (or so my doc tells me).  I have Cervical spondalosis which gives me extreme pain and for which I take 30 tabs daily plus Morphine and liquid Morphine.   Doc has prescribed Duloxetine which is an anti-depressant but which I believe also helps pain. Can anyone on this site who is diabetic tell me about Duloxetine or have they taken it and has it helped with pain?   I am afraid to start taking it as it does not have good reveiws and is used mainly as an anti-depressant. There appear to be too many side effects, some of which I have already from morphine and it appears to be difficult to come off.   If anyone can coment and help me with this I would be really grateful.   I suffer chronic pain 24/7 and my meds at the moment are having little effect on controlling the pain.   They just keep increasing morphine dose which I am a little afraid of.   Does Duloxetine really work in controlling pain?  Thanks to anyone who can ehlp.A|rran103
