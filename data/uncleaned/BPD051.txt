Have you everby thelongerirun » Tue Jun 02, 2015 5:19 pmHave you ever said or did something that was pretty insignificant, but in your head you blow it up to be some huge ordeal? I mean something that really means nothing. Nothing at all except to you. Then you get really upset with yourself, and wonder why the hell you said or did what you did. Im so pissed at myself, and have been all day, over something really stupid, and i know for a fact that its just me. That no one else has even thought twice about it. I am having a really hard time dealing with it right now. I dont know what to do to get it out of my head. Can anyone relate? How do you stop beating yourself up over stupid things.
