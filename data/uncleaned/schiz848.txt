Hello! I\'m 15 and I often read books or watch shows and I place myself in that situation and become so caught up in pretending I\'m that person that I often leave the room and put on different clothes to pretend I\'m them. I know the difference between the pretend life and reality, so I don\'t think I\'m mentally ill. Even a simple task causes my mind to drift and I put my self in this fantasy land. I think I owe it to myself and others around me to actually be myself instead of someone I\'m not. Even listening to music makes me get caught up in my own fantasy land. I want to stop daydreaming obsessively. Please help. XoXo Lily
