Êimpulsive act= disgusted with self.It is within the second category (Impulsive behaviors that are harmful to you or to others.) that i am having trouble. I admit that i have done many things that are impulsive and hurtful to myself and others, it is long list... most of which im not happy about but can live with. However, there is one specific act i have done numerous times that i feel disgust towards. Yet i (of late) continue to do this. Any idea on how to get past this? I dont feel i can talk to any of my friends for fear of shame etc but i need to figure out how to change it.ÊAlso, i dont want to actually name what is im doing. sorry if that makes it difficult to give me a response/reply.
