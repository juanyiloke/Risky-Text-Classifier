Worried about results of CT scan, going to doctor tomorrow.Hi all! First a little background info. I am a female, 51 years old and have been a heavy smoker for 37 years. Three of my family members have died from lung related disease and I am worried.I went in July for complete physical. I went for chest x-ray and doctor called me to come in and told me that my right lung was partially collapsed and that we should wait 3 months to take another x ray to see if it was still there.At the time I went into the doctor's office I had already had a cough. So I go back in October and get another chest x-ray. I was waiting to see if the doctor would call me to come in. After 4 days I made an appt. and went to see him. He told me that I had a nodule on my right lung and ordered a CT scan.I did the CT scan last Monday and am going in tomorrow to get the results. I didn't want to wait for him to call me as he didn't after the 2nd x ray even though there was a problem.I've had a horrible cough for 5 months, mostly with yellow sputum. I am out of breath most of the time, I have to concentrate on breathing when I go to lie down or after doing anything requiring just a little exertion. I am tired all of the time and just have a basic feeling of being unwell.My question is, if I get a diagnosis of lung cancer what can I expect after that? I guess I would need more testing for staging? I did have malignant melanoma 11 years ago but it was caught early and the surgery and removal of satellite nodes seemed to do the trick.I would appreciate any advice or help you can give me. Thanks and God Bless!
