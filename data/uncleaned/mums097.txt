DD is 4 and generally a bright, well-behaved child.We had a baby 6 weeks ago and this has caused a few behavioural issues around pushing boundaries. I know this is probably due to lack of attention on our part and I'm confident about what I need to do to address this behaviour.ÊHowever, for several months now, DD has been adopting a fake sulk when she didn't get her own way or was asked to stop an activity she was enjoying. This was mostly dealt with by ignoring or distracting her. This has now escalated to crying and I'm unsure how to proceed.Common sense would suggest that ignoring the undesirable behaviour and rewarding good behaviour is the best approach but this makes me feel bad and is also difficult to maintain while caring for the baby.I'm finding it really difficult to maintain any kind of routine and spend quality time with DD.Do you have any tips or advice to help?
