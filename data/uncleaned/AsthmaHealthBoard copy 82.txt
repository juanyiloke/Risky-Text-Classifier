Inhalers and mucus in chest________________________________________I have never used an inhaler before and I don't have Asthma, but I think it's allergies, nonetheless, inhalers scare me I had seizures when. I was younger in fact last one was 20 some yrs ago.Don't like what is on directions (precautions)...my main concern is the mucus in chest, I cough and a lot of time bring up phlegm, my Dr said the inhaler would stop the rattling.........she is good, but not an allergist.Now question........what is good (besides inhaler) to loosen mucos. Right now drinking tea and honey. Thanks for any and all input...and for welcoming me to the board.
