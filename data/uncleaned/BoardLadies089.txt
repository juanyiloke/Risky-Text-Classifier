ÊNeed some good, sharp comebacks for comments abouts being single!Hi,I am currently the only singleton left in my group of friends. We are all going away for a weekend to another city at the start of next month.ÊOver the past year, two of the girls in the group have been giving me a lot of hassle and questions about me being single. I am very independent and happy being single, I am not going to get into a relationship with someone unless I really like them, not going to go out with someone just for the sake of it or to keep other people happy.During this weekend away, I am expecting (based on past behaviour) on the nights out, that these girls will be pointing at every man in the pub/nightclub and be asking me all night, 'what about him' or him, etc, what is your type etc.I find this really irritating, I just want to have my night out, not feel like I am a 14 year at a youth disco being pushed over to kiss some guy for the sake of it!!!I don't want to fall out with these girls, but I don't want to spend all weekend dealing with probing questions about my love life or spend the nights out being hassled about every guy in the place.So I need assertive comebacks for these comments that will shut them up fairly quickly!Thanks in advance!
