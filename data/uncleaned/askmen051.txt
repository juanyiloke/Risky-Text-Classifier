any advice would be appreciated2013-08-21, 12:46 PMI really want to work for a few fast growing small businesses in my city. The problem is I am very young (19) and really have no work experience at all but I want to work for them as soon as possible-I don’t care if they have me cleaning floors. I want to be a part of their team and work my way up. How do I get them to take me seriously? How do I word my eagerness and excitement without seeming scary obsessed hahah! I really admire these companies and their aspirations but do you think they’d even think of hiring me as anything with hardly any work experience other than retail and a restaurant?Also, what’s the lowest position I could possibly get?
