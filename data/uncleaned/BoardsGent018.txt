Have I stopped growing at 16?

Well lads, I'm 16 and with the past few years I haven't really grown much but the last two there's been sweet f*ck all growing going on. I'm 5'6?, my mother's about 5'6 and my father is probably 5'7. I'd say I must have hit puberty at around 11 years of age. 

I've been sure as sh*t that I've stopped growing but it's really f*cking depressing to be that small. At 5'6, I have zero chances of going anywhere in sport which I realised about a year ago also. It's fine being small and fast but I was tall when I was younger and had a big and strong frame so I didn't need to be Speedy Gonzalez but as people around me have grown I've stayed the same so I'm too small to be be a strong guy and too heavy (I'm not fat) to be fast , if you get me (a good analogy is if anyone here has seen Beyond The Mat, where the trainer says that Mike Modest is too small to be a Heavyweight and too big to be a Cruiserweight).

I apologise if this is just a load of rabble and about the unnecessary foul language even if it is censored but I just felt like talking and didn't know where to turn so I decided to use the internet as a stage.
