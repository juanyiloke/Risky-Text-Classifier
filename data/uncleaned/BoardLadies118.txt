Fitted sheets not fitting!Hi ladies, I wasn't sure where to ask my question but I figured this might be a good place.I'm having terrible trouble with my fitted sheets and I need some advice!I have a double mattress and I use King-size sheets because I found the double sheets didn't fit properly...they were too tight and pinged right off the mattress.So I started using king-size sheets and they seemed better because they fitted right around the corners of the mattress.But now I think I made the wrong decision using king-size because when we're in bed, the sheet pulls from the corners and the sides and in the morning, the sheet has come away from one or both corners.It also looks like there's too much material on the main part of the bed.What size sheet do you use in this situation?!If I went for super-king size, then I imagine there'd be far too much material left and would most definitely come away from the mattress?I also use a mattress protector sheet which is a kind of mesh material (sort of shiny?) and I think that's also rubbing against the sheet making it come away.Oh I know this sounds so trivial but it's really tedious and I'm fed up having to put the sheet back on the mattress every single morning!Help me!
