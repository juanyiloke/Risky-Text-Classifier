 What's the matter with me  Dragonball, 1 Week Agohey guys I'm new here ,I'm having so much trouble with everything and don't know what's wrong with me ,it's making me feel physically sick ,crying and wanting to find anything I can to make me feel high so I can get out of my feelings ....I have no self esteem or confidence even tho I have tried , I always feel myself lower than others and that if a friend stays away for a few days that they will have forgotten me and not want me anymore (it's happened a lot in the past ) I suffer a lot of pain due to a old condition and have a stressful life due to looking after family members .I can't get out of the bad down stage I'm in right now ,no matter how hard I try Even writing this I'm crying , I can't get hold of my emotions right now either
