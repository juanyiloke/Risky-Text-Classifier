Help with freestyle libreHi I did just do a post however it doesn't appear to have gone on so appologise if this come up twice. My free style libre sensor fell off after 7 days  anyone know whether abbot woukd likely replace this? The offices are not open... Any advise on making it stay there??? Woukd micro tape over the top be ok?? Didn't think would have a problem as seemed pretty stuck so was quite suprised! I use the bath so never submerged it and I do not sweat! Hardly ever. Am concerned about summer though now. Might be rather unsightly with a load of tape on it with vest tops! Wish could use stomach instead like my cgm. Anyone tried anywhere else other than arm?
