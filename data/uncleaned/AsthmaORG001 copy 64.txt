Peak Flow VariabilityHi everyoneSorry I keep posting questions on here, but I'm still only learning - despite having mild "asthma" since I was about 2 years old. I'm now 22 years old. My Doctors always told me "my asthma doesn't worry them" and as such, I never really bothered reading much about it.However, since quitting smoking, I've decided to read more about asthma - I want to treat it as well as possible.One thing I don't understand is peak flow - my highest reading is 560 - but my lowest is 520. This has been recorded everyday for a month. Is such variability normal?I'm also panicking about airway remodeling. Some sources online say it's not really clinically significant - whilst others say it increases mortality. Can anyone chime in w/ details on this?I've never had an attack/ exacerbation - and since quitting smoking, I'm constantly anxious that I will!
