  Feeling Beautiful TodayI just wanted to post this cause I feel really nice today and beautiful for once in mylife . I got dressed all nicely and I think I feel and look pretty.Usually I don't think i look pretty. I'm getting more extra help now since I last time spoke with my therapist about it and what I been through after leaving my job. So meeting with my with someone today, well 2 people really to see if Peer Support works out with me. Sorta nervous but happy at the same time. I hope this goes well for me. Wish me Luck!
