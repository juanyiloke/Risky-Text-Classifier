Do I have an eating disorder?I don't know if i have an eating disorder. I'm 19 years old and at university. Almost 3 years ago my dad died and ever since ive been engaging in what I think is eating disorder behaviors. No one knew what was happening. Now I always think about food constantly and end up eating then hating myself for it. I keep a book where I track everything I eat and if I go over what I want to eat I engage in another behavior. Ifeel disgusted at how I look. I'm fed up of eatingand then hating myself after and constantly thinking about food. I wake up and think about food straight away and then for the rest of the day that's my thoughts. I tried to tell my mum that I sometimes make myself sick but she shouted at me and just go angry, I really don't know what to do.
