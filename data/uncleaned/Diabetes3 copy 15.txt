Lots of health issues - i need to talk!Hello, I hope someone takes the time to read my post today. I feel so down and depressed at the moment. I have suffered from GORD for 12 years and take Omeprazole for it. Over the last couple of months, my symptoms seemed to have got worse and I was convinced I had gallstones as I get a mild (stitch like pain) under my right rib (it's more of a discomfort than a bad pain). Anyway, I've had a couple of tests - one was an ultrasound scan to check for gallstones based on my symptoms and the other was an endoscopy. The endoscopy revealed a hiatus hernia (which I am not too worried about, I can live with that) but the scan has revealed no gallstones BUT they have found a cyst on my liver and I am being referred to a specialist at the end of June. This came as a total shock to me and I am terrified it is cancer although I have spoken to a couple of different GP's about this letter that I received and they basically told me not to worry (easier said than done!) and that cysts are often picked up by scans for something else but of course I am worried as I get symptoms with it (the symptoms that prompted me to go to my GP for a scan in the first place). My father died of liver cancer when he was 77 years old and I am terrified that I have inherited the gene but my GP said that if he had been say younger in age (in his 40's say) then they tend to think more genetics. I also read that having diabetes can increase the risk of liver cancer (and other cancers) and I mentioned this to my GP and she said that diabetes throws up a lot of complications. I just now need to get this cyst sorted out and to find out what is going to be done about it. I am so down as I feel that ever since I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes in 2009, my health has deteriorated - I HATE diabetes with a vengeance! thanks for listening!
