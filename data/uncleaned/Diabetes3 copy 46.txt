Doctors again!!Started with intense foot pain yesterday (almost like a callus) I never suffer from anything like that & coupled with a bit of sensitivity on my little toe on other foot & the pain being like a bad throbbing pain even when I don't stand on my feet, though I'd best ring Drs.Feel like I'm spending my life there atm. They are seeing me as an emergency.Hope I'm not wasting their time!I wear really good sensible shoes (I have to with my Achilles tendinitis) so it shouldn't be my shoes.
