Possible BPD Diagnosis- Needing Helpby bc77711 » Wed May 20, 2015 1:21 pmSo I have had major depression for quite a few years now. From what I can remember, it started about 10 years ago. I started on anti-depressants about 5 years ago but have changed a few times and just still haven't felt "normal". For the first time ever, I went to see a psychiatrist a couple of weeks ago because my symptoms are extremely overwhelming at times. I had been told by my counselor that I show alot of the signs of bipolar disorder but I don't have the lasting manic episodes. When I brought this up to the psych, she said that it's not bipolar and is probably BPD. After doing a lot of research on the subject, I agree with her. She prescribed me lithium carbonate 600mg at night with the cymbalta 120mg I already take. I know there's still more "diagnostics" to be done but BPD really hit home with me and the way I feel.I'm starting a new job soon because my current one stresses me out too much and the hours are very long. It also keeps me away from my family which I am NOT cool with. I'm stressing out about starting the new job because this will be my 15th job in 11 years (I'm 27). I'm afraid that I won't like it or something will happen that will make me want to leave. I feel hopeless that I will ever find something I actually enjoy. I came here hoping that someone could help because working with my psychiatrist isn't fast enough and I'm a little desperate.So, my question is, does anyone else here share the same "feelings"? Does anyone have trouble with jobs like I have? Any advice??
