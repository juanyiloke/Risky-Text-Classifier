Panic And Cleaning Up After Someone Else.I have no idea where to put this so please move if necessaryLong week after only one day.This week I have been dumped in the shit and now I have to clean up other peoples mess again. This seems to be a recurring theme in my life.Background: For the last 18 months I have been helping a local couple run a community based children s programme. They were happy to run things and I was happy to support them. it got me and my 3 yr old out of the house every week and taking on this role made me feel like I was connected to where I live.Unfortunately in the last week I found out that all the money from the last year and a half is now missing. We are massively in debt and had to tell them to quit their positions and took over. Police will probably become involved as the couple cant provide any records as to where they have spent the money or where its gone. They have also decided to run from this leaving me behind to sort out and face angry parents etc.The mention of police being involved was what triggered me in to this 5 day long panic attack as well as having massive anxiety about interacting with people and taking on a massive responsibility.
