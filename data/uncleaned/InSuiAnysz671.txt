34, male, no kids, single, straight, smoke, no drugs or alcohol. Never medicated. I'm fairly decent looking. I'm the same gender I was born. There's nothing about my physical self that would prevent me from living a full and successful life. I can hold a job. I'm a very much competent person. My problems are all the emotional kind. I have no flare for life, I'm insecure all the time, untrusting, obsessive, needy, demanding, clingy, and I cannot maintain a happy relationship with anyone. Relationships always leave me with intense distress. I can't be happy, with or without a companion. I've been depressed my whole life. My first thoughts of suicide were at age 13. I had a shotgun in my mouth when I was 16, but I couldn't do it. From then on, I decided to accept my struggle, and that there's no way out. Last year, I decided I was really going to do it, but I let a priest talk me out of it. A few months later, I was back on my suicidal thoughts, but then I met a girl, and we dated for six months. Now, that's over, and I'm ready... There's no hope for me. I don't want this struggle. Life is a struggle for me as much as the average person, and I just don't have the will or desire to deal with it. I'm done being a puppet, tool, sheep, and victim. I'm done with hunger, thirst, sh**ting, p*$$ing, fatigue, sickness, lust, frustration, anger, hate, depression, guilt, shame, regret, and all the other struggles that everyone else knows. Most people are able to evolve, move on, adapt to change, and accept fate. I'm incapable of all that.
