  Moment of successIt was a day when I was awfully depressed and I was planning to commit suicide. I don't know how far I would've gotten but I never even began. I gave some drawings I made to my little sister (I don't see her too often because she lives with my father) to see if she liked them. She did and I let her keep them. I was considering killing myself later at night when she came up to me (I should mention this was only the fourth or fifth time I'd ever seen her) and gave me a hug. She thanked me for the pictures and walked away. I nearly cried my eyes out. I felt so happy and sad in one moment. The thought of suicide went out of my head the rest of the day. I was just so touched by her hug and affection. I'm still depressed but never when I'm visiting her or my other little sister.
