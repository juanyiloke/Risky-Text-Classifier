is recovery making me physically sick?hi im new to this forum. found it because im nervous/triggered by some physical symptoms that are happening to me.i started intensive outpatient two weeks ago and have been basically on an ensure diet and every now and then we add in some foods as i feel comfortable. but my digestion seems totally messed up. i get crampy and nauseous and sometimes even in pain. im worried about it because sometimes its so bad that i think i am going to get sick. obviously this scares me since purging is a big part of my eating disorder. but i dont WANT to throw up. im scared its going to happen naturally.also, if this is not just a symptom of recovery, and i have come down with a real illness and need to be sick (involuntarily) what happens to the progress i've made with not purging?my body's own functions are scaring me right now! i don't know what i'm supposed to do or what being sick would do to my recovery...
