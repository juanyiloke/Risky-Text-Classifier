DS has been sleeping through since mid December (a very welcome Christmas present indeed) and even before that he usually settled well at bed time.For the last two weeks he's been awful. His routine hasn't changed - bath at 7, then pyjamas, bottle and bed - but now when we out him in his cot he screams. Sometimes he'll chat to himself but it always turns into screams eventually.Almost every night we've given in and given him a second bottle, which settles fine after. This has led me to think perhaps it could be a growth spurt? Although he doesn't seem much hungrier during the day.I've read about 18 month sleep regression, and whilst I'm usually a bit dubious regarding these things it does seem to hit the nail on the head.I suppose I need advice regarding how to deal with him at bed time. I know giving him a second bottle is only making things worse but DP and I are both under a lot of stress at the moment (exam time for him, new promotion for me) and are utterly exhausted. Probably a shit excuse but we're struggling. Thanks
