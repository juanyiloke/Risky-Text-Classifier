No (known) Criterion AReading through @stenni's thread on "calling troll". I was intrigued by the views expressed in @simplySimon's compilation of members views on criterion Ahttps://www.myptsd.com/c/threads/calling-troll-on-new-posters.53065/page-2#post-847655Partial disclosure; I don't have a formal diagnosis (and don't want one), and have no conscious memory of what went on in the first six months of my life. but I do have the scar tissue. After a few years of believing that I couldn't possibly have PTSD(The only PTSD I'd heard of prior to last year, was the <2% of cases that are combat related), I now find PTSD to be a very useful paradigm for trying to understand my half century on this planet.For many, Criterion A is a classic "Catch 22" situation. The trauma has resulted in dissociative amnesia - so we have no conscious memory of that trauma, and in many cases, even if we had, it's probably far too triggering to admit to anyway...Is there any other "diagnosis" which requires something that one of the main symptoms of - precludes you knowing about it or being able to freely communicate it?How do we deal with this, both for ourselves and for the "vaguely unhappy individuals" who come here wondering if they might have PTSD?
