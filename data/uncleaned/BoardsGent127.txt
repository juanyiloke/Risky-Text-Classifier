How do you treat yourselfPay day comes around, you know you have a quiet few weeks/month ahead with absolutely zero on, your mates are all busy, no weddings/christenings/birthdays etc and have no major outgoings. Happy days!You know you have a few bob to play around with... So. How to the men of TGC treat yourselves?? Maybe most of you will save it, but i tend to look at these occasions as an opportunity to buy myself a wee treat  (I dont include bring the future Mrs Slattsy out to dinner as my treat per say)For me, its a quality bottle of scotch. I wander up to the Celtic Whiskey shop after work and spend 30 mins there sampling a few different ones. I love my life when i get a new bottle.Interested what you guys do
