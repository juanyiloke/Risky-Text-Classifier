Easily Washable Hair Clay/WaxSo I usually let my hair grow for 3 months before getting it cut, and even then I just get it cut with a scissors. But anyway when I get it cut I usually use wax or clay everyday for 5 or 6 weeks till it becomes long-ish again, to which I just wet it in the morning, brush it and let it dry out.I have a great hair-clay I use at the weekends which I wear when heading out, it doesn't give an overly looking wet-look and lasts ages and keeps the hair in perfect shape.However, it's too hard to wash out, even in the shower it takes 2 washes to get out properly. So I wouldn't use this during the week.The one I do use during the week is Lynx wax (the purple one), shockingly greasy but it washes out grand with a splash of water.Is there any other clay/wax/other products I can use during the week that will wash out easily but not make me look like a greasy monkey and have a wet-look to it?
