Another "guess the A1c"Hi there everyone.   Got my annual review with la Doctora Botas at 10.40 today. I'm nervous - obviously - but excited too. It's the first time in 4 years that I've actually been looking after myself - just small steps: diet, nutrition, carb counting UK-stylee, regular exercise, etc. In December, my A1c was 8.3 (we still use old money here). I'm hoping for a 7.8 but won't be discouraged by an 8. What d'you reckon guesstimators? Are you up for the challenge?! Btw, thank you for all the support - I would still be a mess if it wasn't for this forum!
