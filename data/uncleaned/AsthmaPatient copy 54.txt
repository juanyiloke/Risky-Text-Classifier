Shortness of Breath / Tight Chest Hi -Apologies for the long message in advance but I would really appreciate any advice or help.I am a 36 year old male - diagnosed with asthma since childhood. Been using Seretide for a few years now and my asthma has been well under control with no recent attacks and I attended yearly reviews.However, In January this year I became breathless very suddenly and was eventually diagnosed with a chest infection. The shortness of breath and tightness in my chest has never gone although the chest infection cleared with erythomycinThe odd thing is my peak flow is consistently between 650 and 800 which is supposedly good and I don't have to use my Ventolin more than once a day if at all. My spirometry test was normal in fact excellent and showed my lung age to be 10 years younger than I am. I have had 2 chest xrays - both clear. My GP has tried treatment for anxiety, GERD and candida but this has not worked. I had a barium swallow test today for hiatus hernia but this was negative.I am really getting frustrated now - is it possible to have asthma but have normal spirometry and feel like this? I don't have a wheeze or cough and I am not producing sputum. It is just this continual tightness in the chest and shortness of breath. I continue to take Seretide. My doctors surgery are covinced there is no serious lung disease and are not keen on referring me to a chest physician but I am getting very scared now.Has anyone have any idea what this may be or what I should do next. Up until Jan 2012 I have been perfectly healthy? Any help greatly appreciated.
