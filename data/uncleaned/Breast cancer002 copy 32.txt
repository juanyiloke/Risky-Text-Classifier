Lung pain.¥	Hello ladies!¥	My mum is experiencing stabbing pain in her right lung, when she moves her arm. Ever since she was in hospital and they told her she has coarse bronchovascular markings in her right lung. Have any of you had any similar experience? We will speak to thr onco Doctor on Wednesday before her chemo, but we're just worried it might be something else.... She had a ct scan 4 weeks ago and that was clear, but I know how evil Cancer can be...¥	p.s she hasn't had any surgery yet
