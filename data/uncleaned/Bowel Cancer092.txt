Moods swingsOver the last six months my moods have been all over the place, I feel sorry for my wife who has seen me happy then sad it's been roller coaster but hopefully I have some positive news my tumour on my colon has reduced by 50% which is great news the secondary cancer on my liver & Lung have not grown or shrunk and the liver function test for the last six months have come back normal so they have decided to operate on the liver in July. So my last chemo for while will be Monday people need strong family to get through this I have been lucky with chemo nurses who talk to me and have compassion and listen to my worries without making judgement , I don't think I would have got through this without their support anybody out there don't suffer in silence talk to somebody it helps you cope with everything that life throws at you
