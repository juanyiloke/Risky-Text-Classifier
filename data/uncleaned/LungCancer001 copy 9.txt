Waiting on results...6 weeks ago, had shortness of breath and chest pains. Doctor saw me next morning EKG was fine. Sent for liver ultrasound as I have had liver issues 20 years ago. Liver showed some abnormalities. Requested MRI. MRI showed liver was fine, but a spot on lung and L1 vertebrae. New MRI n vertebra shows simple hemangioma, they will test again in three months. Lung showed mass on lowest lobe of right lung. CT of lung, shows mass (tumor?) of lower right lung, about 5.7 cm by 3.5 cm. Next test was CT of brain due to ocular changes. Bronchoscopy yesterday, while I was sedated doc talked with my husband and said it could be cancer, cannot say for sure, if it is, stage 3A. My husband will not tell me exactly what doctor said, though its first time i have ever see my husband shed a tear. I am a very positive person and cannot see myself dying of this. I feel sicker than i ever have but i still feel very healthy. Can anyone help? Offer advice? Questions I need to ask? Final note, I am Canadian living in USA on military spouse VISA - my husband is Canadian military here with NATO. so we only get to see base drs.
