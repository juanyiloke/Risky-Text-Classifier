wanted to share something that i found amusing:)hi.so i thought this was amusing:when i write emails, sometimes i like to finish them with " emily x" with x being the kiss cymbol.. and to say, i love you guys well, someone replied to 1 of my emails saying" hello emily x", and i had to explain... no... my last name does not start with X- that's just a kiss at the end of my messages!. then we had a laugh about that fact that if i was actually emily x, i'd be a super hero... because it does kind of sound like a super hero name lolthat was the highlight of my weekend
