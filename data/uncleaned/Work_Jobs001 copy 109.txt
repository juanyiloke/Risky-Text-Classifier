New role nothing to do - stressful????________________________________________I've been transferred due to physical effects of stress - grinding teeth at night - tempromandibular problems, leading to arthritis in my neck, also sleep problems for a year - diagnosed with burnout and was off - lots of stress in a stressful job, mostly interpersonal stuff. Now, Occ Health have advised transfer, only if I agreed, so temporarily transferred - I hope - however with new job they are just leaving me sit in an office all day with nothing to do - I'm well paid, and others think I should just go with this, but I find it demoralising - especially with other staff commenting on it. The manager that was over me in the other job is over me now, and I feel he is doing nothing to get me some work, as he resents that it all went to Occ Health, and I got so sick - it took him a year to send me to Occ Health, and then only after my G.P. wrote me off for stress. Queston: Would any of you feel demoralised at the prospect of being at work with no work, or would you just, as my friends think, take the 60k per year and don't make an issue of no work? I would be interested in all of your comments/advice.
