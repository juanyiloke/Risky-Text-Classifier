  Flushing skin when having attack...________________________________________Hi guys.First post here. Had asthma all my life which was worse when I was a kid, then seemed to get better in my early 20's. I'm now 33, active runner (no problems with exercise if I'm not symptomatic already) and I have attacks a few times a year that coincide with infections or cat allergy exposure but lately it seems more frequent. I guess I have a couple questions, as I've never really been close to anyone else with asthma, and I want to know if my experiences are normal for the disease. One, I don't get "instant" asthma attacks...usually starts insidiously after a day or two of a cold, and once the cold/virus/whatever is gone, the tightness gets worse and worse as the week goes on...eventually to the point where I can't get short sentences out without coughing or walk without being out of breath. Just end up coughing coughing coughing with every breath and waking up tight and coughing. I take the MDI and albuterol neb but usually it still ends up with me maxing that out and getting a script for prednisone. Is it normal to have "slow" attacks like this?Two, does anybody else get red flushed skin? No rash, just red blanchable skin, especially neck and chest, once things start getting pretty tight?
