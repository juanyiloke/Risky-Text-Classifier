ÊI feel like I don't really have schizophrenia.I can't shake this feeling that I'm somehow making up that I have schizophrenia for attention (though I hate attention. It makes me nervous and paranoid) caused by the placebo effect going on full blast. What if I don't really have hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, etc? That I subconsciously wish for the attention so bad that my brain creates it? Like the cause of my paranoia is me thinking hard enough about the worst case scenario of every single thing and person? The delusions could be the same thing. My subconscious creates a story and plays it out to the point where I feel it? What if my misery is all self created and self induced for some ****ed up reason? Like purposely ruining my life by my brain putting the placebo effect into full mode and in all reality, I don't really experience any of this.Ê
