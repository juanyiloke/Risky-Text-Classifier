Cloth capsIt should be on the humour board really, but it has a serious side to it too.Is it me, I ask, but I find men that wear cloth caps while driving are irritating. I have had many an instance were, if I had a rocket launcher, I would have used it to remove the individual from the road.   . The worst one I experienced was about five years ago, it was a sunny day, I was driving to Buxton from Glossop. I just reached the top of the hill coming out of Glossop, and the road ahead which I was looking forward to, to open up a bit and enjoy the fresh air coming through the Windows, but just before the top of the hill, a car pulled out of a junction, yes, the driver was wearing a cloth cap, he had his dear wife with him too, she had this mass of grey hair, as if she had been electrocuted. He drove at 20 to 25 mph. This particular stretch of road has a lot of bends and dips so it is virtually impossible to overtake. I was behind him all the way to Buxton and so was a tailb[size=78%]ack of a couple dozen cars also, some of them took a chance and overtook, a few near misses too with oncoming traffic. This guy was oblivious to what he causing, I mean it was a 50mph zone.[/size]This morning, I came across another c c, driving an old merc at 20mph in a 40 zone, I didn't know it was a cloth cap until I passed him, and sure enough there it was, fixed to his head, like a badge of honour. I am going to get a cloth cap, out of curiosity of course, to see if it affects my driving.
