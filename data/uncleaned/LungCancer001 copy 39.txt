  Lung CancerHi everyone, I am 60yrs old, and on the 31st AUgust I had a Lobectomy, they removed my lower right lobe on my right lung due to a 2cm tumour........I originally had a bad chest infection so had a ct scan, the scan showed the infection but theycould see something behind it so I had to go on anti bitocis for a week to clear the infection so they could see it more clearly, it was a dark shadow.....I was sent to a Lung specialist who ordered a pet Scan, ct Scan, broncolopsy, a biopsy on a lymph node under my arm 9 which glowed red in the pET scan), also a biopsy on my lung............al tests came back negative except for the lung biopsy..........so I had a lobectomy and they got the 2 cm tumour, luckily it hasn't gone anywhere else, so I am cancer free!!! An awful operation it is, after 6 weeks I am still in excrutiating pain, I am living off pain killers at the moment, but can feel myself getting better every day...I would be interested to hear fr om others that have had this operation...
