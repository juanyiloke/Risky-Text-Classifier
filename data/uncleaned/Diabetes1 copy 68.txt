Do you feel limited by diabetes?One of my all time favorite movies, Steel Magnolias, has got me believing diabetics have limits, and it's all M'Lynn's fault! If she hadn't told Shelby she had limits (when she told her she and Jackson were thinking about having a baby), I wouldn't be here asking this question today! About the only thing I felt I couldn't do as a woman with diabetes is have children of my own. Type 1 diabetes runs in my family on my mother's side and I'm so scared I might pass it on to my children. But, other than that, I'm feeling pretty good. What about you? Do you ever feel limited by diabetes? Is there anything you want to do but feel you can't because of diabetes? Please share! Thank you so much!
