Êfeeling pathetic, stupid and very bleughWhy is life like a roller coaster? Had had a positive trauma therapy session yesterday which reflected in a positive shift that has happened....and how it was good that the competent, adult Kate was able to hold the conversation with the therapist rather than vulnerable S emerge. Whilst I was shattered afterwards, I was able to recognise that steps are being taken and that it's good that the therapist is providing positive feedback.But today, S has taken over with a vengeance. Have felt very weak and was thankfully not at work. CPN recognised struggles and gave me a hug. Felt very stupid and little like a child. And to top it all, I was meant to take my son to a sixth form meeting that I was dreading anyway and the quiet village road between home and there was closed by the police which would have resulted in a massive detour that would have made us embarrassingly late. Of course, I know it's not my fault as I had left ample time but it just feels like the last straw. Am meant to be on an all day course tomo in the middle of London and can't it.....ÊCan't face the journey or the act of smiling. I'm usually so bloody good at sinking but I just can't right now x sorry. Just bleugh, bleugh, bleugh xx
