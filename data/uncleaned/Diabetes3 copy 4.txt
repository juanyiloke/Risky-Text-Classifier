Medical Imaging (retinal screening)This firm has taken over from Paula Carr in Kent - don't know how far afield they used to go.I usually have my test in May/early June. Rang them this morning to be told next visit is in July but very luckily they had just had a cancellation for tomorrow morning which needless to say I grabbed. I had actually seen them around the surgery week before last!! So obviously can no longer rely on an automatic appt coming in the post. Was only kept waiting on the phone for 3 minutes despite being told I was 4th in the queue. The reply back from the appointments lady was within 15 minutes. The new number is 03334560122
