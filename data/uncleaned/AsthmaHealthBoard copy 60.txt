  Mad at Kaiser________________________________________Have not posted in a bit. Feeling the need to vent. I have been sick for months. Bad cold,bronchitis ,pneumonia and somewhere in the mist being diagnosed with asthma. Which has never gotten under control. That is enough to frustrate anyone but that is not why I vent. Mid May I requested a refill of my meds giving plenty of extra time to ensure I would not run out. Well Kaiser pharmacy decided to threaten a strike. They never did strike but there was talk of very long waits at the pharmacy. I felt confident my meds would arrive in time because I had given them an extra week or so. Well I was wrong. Before I knew it I had run out of my Dulera inhaler and my nebulizer med. I figured the meds would get there the next day. They were already so late how much more could it be? A couple days later no meds. That was Friday I called the pharmacy and the girl said my order had just been received! Plus only the inhaler was available. I sent a message to my dr and the nurse called back and arranged for me to pick up both medications that evening after work. I was very glad to have my medications. I had not realized how much they were helping. Even though my asthma is not under control they must have been helping because being without them a couple days has set me back quite a bit. Woke up Saturday feeling worse and it has continued. My breathing is shallow. Feel like my lung capacity has lessened quite a bit. Chest pain and back pain off and on. I just feel like some of my pneumonia symptoms are coming back and it freaks me out! I am very mad at Kaiser. They put my health and the health of others in jeopardy.
