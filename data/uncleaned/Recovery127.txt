Recovery From Inactivity?I'm finding it really hard to write but I feel I've got to do something:I was reading a pinned thread on recovery and noted that a common theme was goal setting as a driver of recovery.This made me think about my own recovery (or lack there-of); I have ceased to create goals. I used to do so but found that my lack of energy and motivation lead to consistent frustration when I abandoned them.This is not to say that I don't have any goals, more that they are contingent on gaining a certain level of functioning before I can pursue them again.I am quite worried that I will follow in my grandmother's foot steps in terms of my depression. She had catatonic depression which was treated with ECT. This treatment is now giving diminishing returns but she is pretty stable. Her medical records actually state that she has schizophrenia, which is the most common condition to see catatonia.I notice some mild, yet worrying features of her condition in myself. Namely severly dampened thought, a propensity towards echolalia (repeating another persons speach), lack of motivation, physical heavyness and inactivity. I am currently pursuing meds; I have just started Valdoxan (agomelatine 25mg) after several years of psychotherapy. I have previously tried Cymbalta which worsened my condition.I would be interested to hear your experience if you have recovered from a similar state through whatever means.Sorry it's long,Clip
