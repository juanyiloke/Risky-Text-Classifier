Is this asthma?________________________________________Ok for a month or so now ive been having this air hunger feeling. When I say air hunger I mean I go to take a deep breath and cant get a deep satisfying breath. About every 5th breath or if I try to yawn I can finally get that satisfying breath. And also I get chest pains from time to time in the middle and also it seems like when I draw in air it is really slow...like its not hard to do it just takes a little longer to fill my lungs. This year ive had extensive bloodwork multiple ekgs nuclear stress test and echocardiogram. I went to lung doctor and he did a chest xray and a pulm func test. The lady doing the test said my.numbers werent that good but when I had the follow up with the doctor he said they werent terrible and said I could have asthma or sleep apnea...he really didnt give me any explanation and gave me a dulera inhaler. The inhaler hasnt.done anything.for it. Sometimes when I press right under my ribs in the center.of my.chest it is very tender. I dont know if that has anything to do with it or not. Ive been having.the chest pain issue for over a year but the.breathing issue just recently. Does anyone have any thoughts on what this could be or where to go from here? Thanks alot
