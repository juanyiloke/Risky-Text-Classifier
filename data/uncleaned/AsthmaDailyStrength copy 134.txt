HI everyone. I have a 2.5 year old son and a 1 year old daughter. My daughter has asthma, chronic ear infections, and since December, has suffered with a compromised immune system for no apparent reason. She gets nebulizer treatments, and I am trying to keep her immune system up with probiotics galore! One thing I have noticed is that since my daughter's health problems have come up, i have lost friends. Edie was NEVER sick before December! Then she was dx with asthma, and everything fell apart. I had to leave my job and pull her out of daycare to keep her healthy. We are in and out of the hospital, ER and are now regulars at the doctors office. I never wanted to be in this situation. I never post about her health on facebook or anything, because I don't want to be the debbie downer. My friends kids are all healthy and perfect. I don't know if it is that they can't relate or what, but nobody asks about her and when I try and vent my frustration, they change the subject. I feel so alone. My husband is a military guy and a smoker (he smokes outside). One friends husband said to me, "You are to blame for this for not making him quit." PLEASE tell me how to MAKE a grown man quit smoking! I am doing the best I can and just feel rejected by people I thought cared. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks for listening....i never share my feelings anymore because I feel like nobody wants to hear it.
