So down I am having a difficult time at the moment, I have a bad chest infection, asthma flaring, I've broken my left and right ribs, and struggling so much that I'm unable to walk around my home without getting very wheezy and breathless. Since 2012 I've been on a diet and managed to loose weight even though I'm on Prednisolone I've gone down from 17 stones to below 11 stones, my mobility was better when I was 17 stone I'm now having to shuffle around with a walking stick. I desperately want to get a job because my finances are dwindling significantly, I am in no fit state to work at the moment. I try to stay cheerful but over the last few weeks I've been feeling so down, angry and useless. What's the point of it all.
