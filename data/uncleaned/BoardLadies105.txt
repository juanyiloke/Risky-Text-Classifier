Age Gap FriendshipsThis is a question I've pondered for a while - ladies, how many of you are good friends with someone either a good bit older or a good bit younger?ÊA few years ago I was friendly at work with this lady who was in her late 40s. When I finished working there she'd often text and we'd meet up for a drink etc. A few years on and we still now meet regularly - I'm in my early 30s an she's in her early 50s. We have some mutual friends but also we kind of like the same things so have plenty to chat about.ÊThing is when I mention to some people that I'm friends with someone who is not of my generation we'll say they find it extremely odd.ÊJust wondering what you all think - strange?/normal?.
