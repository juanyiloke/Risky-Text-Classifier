Undergraduate Research in Combat PTSDby Rei04 » Sat Mar 28, 2015 5:56 pmBecause I'll be done with community college this summer; in the Fall I will instantly turn into a Junior at a University. Just to consider which University to apply to, I am visiting Psychology Department pages of various Universities and looking over research interests of faculty. I wanted to find out if anyone on this forum has participated in research focused on working with veterans and combat related PTSD. Do you know what role undergraduate students might have had? So far, I've realized that the Department of Veteran Affairs sets forth requirements for internships on the (USAJobs.gov) website. Internships requiring a minimum of an associate's degree (undergrads), for engaging in social work with veterans, encompasses doing clerical work and answering phones.I hope someone can share with me their experiences as a graduate student who delegated their secretarial concerns to an undergraduate student. Also, I'm hoping for stories from those who worked in this area as an undergraduate student.Thanks
