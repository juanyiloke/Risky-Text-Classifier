How do you prevent leg cramps?Before I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I remember getting really bad leg cramps (in my calves and toes) at night. It was so bad, I would jump out of bed screaming! It took forever for it to go away; the the next morning, I was sore. I was always afraid to go to sleep at night because of the leg cramps, but didn't learn until just recently that leg cramps is one of the very first signs of diabetes. Over the years I learned how to breathe at night to prevent cramps from happening; and I made sure not to yawn and stretch at the same time -- that brought it on! For a while, everything was OK, but lately, I'm getting them again. Anybody else get leg cramps at night? How do you prevent them? I'm even thinking about wearing compression stalkings to bed, but that's not very sexy, is it? What do YOU do about leg cramps at night? Thanks so much!
