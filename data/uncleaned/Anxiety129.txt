health anxiety over spray taN now Ê12    As daft as it sounds I got my nails done today went our my comfort zone treating myself to a spray tan til now o believe it's killing me I couldn't breath whike she was spraying me And them I went into a panic attack a small one I now sit down for my Chinese and finishe'd it I habe overwhelming doom feeling in pit my stomach and chest and a very strong urge feeling to puke like one I've never had before I feel like I may be sick and not be able to breathe it feels if I'm sick it will come on violently I now have the fear that I'm allegic or too much toxins and they are reacting I know thousands of girls have nails done then speay tans why am I the girl who is now feeling ill from it and "dying" what if I am the girl that dies from a spray tan I have never had one before so who knows I might ? I sound absolutely pathetic I know but to me this is very real ! has anyone had a speay tan can it make you feel sick ??Did it make you lose your breathe when you first had it done ?
