Any bra experts out thereAre there any lingerie experts that could help me with my diddy dilemma. I just cannot get a bra to suit despite being measured professionally. I've been a 34D according to my last fitting and have always found these bras really comfortable. I like the underwired, non padded style.I don't look as if I have big boobs, no-one has commented on them.However, recently I felt the triumph bras weren't supportive enough so off I went to get measured this week and this range was recommended in a 34 EÊNow, the new bras have definitely whooshed everything up but I feel my cleavage now starts under my chin ! They are comfortable but it feels a bit strange. From the side I look as if I have a small bust. Can anyone recommend the PERFECT bra please.
