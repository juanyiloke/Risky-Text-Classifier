Increase in Size of Lung NodulesSix years ago two lung nodules (one was 2 mm and the other was 2.5 mm) were seen on a CT scan after a bout with pneumonia. I was not told of these. I was told I was fine with no more follow-up scans. Recently I had another lung scan which showed that one nodule has grown to 11 mm. It has been six years. All nodes in the area were clear. I am due to see my pulmonogist in four weeks. I have searched and cannot find any information on this type of increase. I am frightened. I would appreciate any comments.
