Anorexia treatment adviceHey all im 22 and for years ive suffer with anorexia nervosa alongside anxiety ive tried many ways to gain weight but i seem to lose it just as fast so i was wondering what other treatments are there? I was thinking of asking my doctor if i could have a 'NG Tube' fitted through my nose to help me get the kick start i need but im curious if you have to be a specific weight to obtain the treatment as i cant seem to find any information online
