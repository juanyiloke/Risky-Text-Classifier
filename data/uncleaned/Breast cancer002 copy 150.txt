hi - I am a newbie¥	Even though I am a newbie to this forum, I am due my last chemo on Thursday. Can't wait. The actual chemo hasn't been too bad but I have used the cold cap which has been hard.¥	I saw my oncologist tonight. I start radiotherapy in 3 weeks. 20 sessions. He originally told me 15. When I asked why more he said because my tumour was a Grade 3 and I am under 50, it was to reduce the risk of it returning. This has thrown me a bit tonight. I have tried to remain positive throughout my treatment, I am even still working. Keeping things as normal as I can. But this has made me a bit down. ¥	I am sureI will be back to normal tomorrow.i
