New to type 2 diabetes - help!   I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 weeks ago. It goes hand in hand with my hypertension and although I have various appointments for dietitian, podiatrist, eye testing, bloods etc, I feel a bit confused just now. I've got tablets for cholesterol too. I want to manage these things as best I can but my eyesight is terrible - suddenly worse than before and I worry about what to eat (although presumably that will be sorted out with the dietitian. I just feel a bit lost just now. I'm a fit (but overweight) person and feel it's all a little unfair really. It's easter and everyone's tucking into chocolate eggs and I'm not!! I'm really feeling sorry for myself today aren't I? Any advice and or assurance would be very welcome at this point.
