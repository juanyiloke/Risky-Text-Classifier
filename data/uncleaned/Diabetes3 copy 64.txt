Freestyle libre, the first sensorMy son's first sensor has just come to an end. The results have been perfect from day 1 so I guess we are very lucky. He hasn't had any allergies or discomfort and it came off easily and has left no lumps or bumps.We have had very mixed results over the 14 day period, with no real patterns emerging. I think it has just confirmed my suspicions that diabetes is very complicated.The purpose of having it was to reduce the finger pricking and we had cut that down to twice a day, just to make sure the sensor was accurate. I also wanted to see if it were possible to use the information gleaned to reduce his Hba1C although at 5.9% I know it is pretty good. I don't see that it is going to reduce further on his current mixed insulin regime. The averages show that over the 14 day period he was 6.5 and that is probably pretty close to where we have been for a while.I wanted to use this information to try to decide whether to move over to MDI when we next see our Consultant in July. The jury is still out, I just can't decide whether it will improve our results. I do think it might make life more flexible and perhaps try to eradicate the swings that we have always had. If there is anyone out there who has changed, I would love to know whether it really made the difference, other than for convenience.What I have found, is that having the libre has made me somewhat obsessive. It has been the Easter break for Jamie and I have scanned him a great deal. If he is higher it makes me very uncomfortable and I suspect he may pick up on this. So when the sensor ended today I felt some sense of relief as we don't plan to use the second one immediately.
