Prostate CancerWas told a few months back I had Prostate Cancer and it was suggested I get the Prostate removed.The surgery was done 3 weeks ago but the continued incontinence is driving me crazy.I am using pads but am afraid to have a normal life like going out shops ,pub etc.Can anyone tell me how long is this likely to continue or will I ever get back to normal.I am doing the pelvic floor exercises but they seem to make little difference.Thanks
