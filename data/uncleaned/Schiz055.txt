Violence and Angerby Imperius » Thu Mar 05, 2015 6:18 pmAnyone here with schizophrenia have anger issues like me? Today I was in the car with my parents, we were making a right turn and this guy was also making a turn. We blocked each other off, and both of us are refusing to back off. I got extremely angry after several minutes. I swore at the guy but didn't escalate the situation because my parents told me not to. I however swore on my name that next time something like this happens, I would ram my car into the person, then drag him out and beat the $#%^ out of him. How do others deal with situations like this?
