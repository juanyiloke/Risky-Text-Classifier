In An Abusive Relationship With Myself...

This is a thought that I'm really still trying to make sense of and wondered if others here might understand what I'm meaning.

I've been working on my self esteem, sense of self worth and self care in therapy over the past few months. I'm in the process of changing jobs and yesterday had a message from my new manager which, for absolutely no reason, panicked me and I really freaked out. After I has stopped panicking I felt really tired and went for a nap. All of this is pretty normal for me but, knowing that my reaction to the message was all out of proportion I've been trying to unpick what happened.

In thinking about my internal dialogue around this issue I realise I immediately started blaming myself for what perceived to have gone wrong and the absolutely berated myself for it. Honestly, I feel ashamed at way I spoke to myself about this - using really abusive language and calling myself awful names. If I spoke to anyone like that in real life they would leave me and rightly so. It also occurred to me though that while I am incredibly abusive towards myself, I also respond to me in the way an abused person would (and yes, this is where it gets complicated/freaky/psychobabble like). So I try to hide in my bed, use mindless Internet games to stop me listening to myself, I don't do anything that I might get wrong in case I end up angry with myself again - basically I see me responding to myself the way my mum did with my dad. The bottom line is I don't feel safe in my relationship with myself.Ê

I don't know if that makes any kind of sense to anyone but it feels like the best way to describe why I feel stuck with myself. I saw my therapist yesterday before all this happened and felt very detached and disengaged - I'm going to call her and see if she can fit me in again this week to try and sort this all out in my head but wondered if this sounded familiar to anyone else?
