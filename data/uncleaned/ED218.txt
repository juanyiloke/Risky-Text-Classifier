ÊGetting anxiousI don't like to post here because I said I wouldn't, but anyway.My weight has gone up to the bottom end of my 'normal' weight range prior to having calorie issues. I don't want it to go higher, I keep feeling so fat, had to buy new clothes. I've been watching what I eat, but not losing weight. Mood up, I want to eat everything, today I look in the fridge and it all looks good, and I think "why not, eat a load it will be so nice" and my self control and will power are failing me.I'm getting worried that I'll never be able to control my weight again. At the same time quietly thinking, so what?When I think back to 3yrs ago and the state I was, the pain inside and the horrible anxiety and over control, why would I wish that on myself again?I don't want to feel that way again, but I don't want to feel fat and disgusting again either which is what led me to the issue.I don't know what to do.I keep wanting to restrict, but I don't have the will power any more.ÊIt feels out of control.
