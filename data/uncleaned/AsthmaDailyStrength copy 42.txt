When I tell Dr.s that I was diagnosed with asthma in 2000. The doctors do not believe me and then say the medicines that I am on are for COPD. I had a methocoline challenge test done and the results came back that I have asthma. Had to switch doctors about two years ago and had to do a PFT test, and this shows that I have asthma, after this the doctor said my weight was the cause and my weight at that time was 180 pounds. This doctor retired. I had a sinus infection which flared up my asthma and was recommended to see another doctor. Went to see this doctor and since I never smoked its not COPD, an he wants to do another PFT test, which means I have to go off my medicines for 72 hours. It seems like I have to prove that I have asthma. Right know my peak flow is around 600. The doctor would no believe it was that high and I blew the number right in front of him. Is the any doctors in the quad cities or Jolie, IL you would recommend that would help with my asthma instead of do the same tests over and over? I fund it interesting that you may have asthma but if you smoke its copd. Thanks for your help
