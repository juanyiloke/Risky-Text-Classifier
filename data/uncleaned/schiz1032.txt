HallucinationsHello, I am new to this, i just registered so I hope I do everything correct. I need some advice.I have been seeing things, not like some indistinguishable shadows in the corners of your eyes. They are blurry, but I can manage to see what they are. For example I saw a man sitting on a car, only the car being there, I saw a cat between some flowers at the mall but again nothing was there. And when I see something in the corner of my eye, I still pretty much know what it is, like the shape of a man or a head. When I turn my sight, it's all gone, but I still get scared. I have also had what I think were auditory hallucinations, for example hearing a buzz like an insect trying to escape coming from my laptop's case, or my friends who were in the bus yelling my name, even though it was physically impossible for me to hear them if they really did say my name. Also, when I look at some things, they just expand. I close my eyes and they are normal again but then it all starts again and they expand. And the color is wrong. I mean, in the dark, I could see an object that was red and yellow, but in fact it's color was beige. I do not know if I have a medical condition or what it is, I tried talking to my parents but I just can't tell them these kind of things without them thinking I'm crazy because they're rather old-fashioned. I also tried to get in contact with a psychologist but I can't go without my parents approval which sends me back to problem number one.Please if any of you can relate, or give me the slightest piece of advice, I will be really thankful.
