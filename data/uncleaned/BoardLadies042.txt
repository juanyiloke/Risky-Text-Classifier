Following your dreamsI'm considering throwing caution to the wind and going after what I really want. This would mean risking -looking like an idiot, -failing, -becoming poor. It would mean giving up the career path I'm on (which gives me a better shot at achieving job/financial security) to go after the work I really want. I may know the first step, but I don't have a good clear plan of how to get there. Because of that, I took the sensible/safer road. Seven years later, I still have regular swells of regret. I tell myself that my decision was a good one and that I'm happy with it but my mind still continually searches for some solution that I havent found yet. I envy people I know who are following their dreams or doing something close to what I want. I try to fill the hole with other projects and hobbies that distract me but never fill that need, and no amount of logic quiets that voice/feeling/wish.This may sound like a thread for Personal Issues but the purpose of this thread is not to ask for advice. I want to ask about other peoples' experiences. Do you have a dream? Have you ever experienced a conflict of this kind between going after what you really want and doing what was more sensible/safe? What did you decide and how has it worked out for you? Is "following your dreams" a luxury or a necessity?
