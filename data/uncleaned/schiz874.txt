I don't have schitzophrenia but i have a chronic pain condition that was misdiagnosed as purely mental...I took risperdal at about 2-6mg with a max dose of lexapro then zoloft and i lost my sex drive the first day i took it...I was in so much pain at the time i continued taking it for about 2 months...Then i didn't like the risperdal b/c i noticed i started to lactate and the ssris found out later have a synnergic effect on it...And finally i took more ssris for another 8 months till i found out where the pain was from...I blame risperdal b/c i had a good sex drive on ssris until that was added to the mix......So now my question is has anyone ever gotten their sex drives back to baseline after taking a mid to high dose of risperdal>? even if it took them months to years to get it back do they eventually come back or is there as drug needed to reverse this effect? I know for a fact it induced some type of secondary hypogonadism in me and i am definitely not the only one as i know a few others this happened to...BTW it has been 2 years since i took that garbage drug that damaged my libido and soul...
