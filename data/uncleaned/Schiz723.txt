ÊDeactivation of "positive" and "negative" symptomsI have been successfully able to deactivate the positive and the negative symptoms, after decades of illness, with the help of doctors. It took years of effort. I am not going into the details of it, because this is more personal, and I understand everyone is different. The main focus I used was "fear" and the notion that healing Is feeling.The mechanism is irreversible, but has a protective/survival use. Adapting to it has a lot to do with acceptance of yourself in association with the various labels. Acceptance and management are most important. I was thinking I would become stable and "normal" again and start off where I left off decades ago. Those wants are for different times and for different conditions of the brain/body. You can't recreate or undo, but it can be a driving force. The past is over, but the "wants" can be similar, similar but different.I am happy to be alive and becoming more accepting of my mixed thoughts/feelings about myself in regards to the past/present/future.
