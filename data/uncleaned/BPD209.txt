 PainHere goesI hate myselfI hAte my lifeI hate my exI am in so much pain I am ruminating about suicideI want to self harmI want to drink and take as much drugs as possibleI need a hospital stayI love my daughter and family but cannot be thereHow can the world keep going on when I'm sadI'm so sad , angry I punched walls and doors I see nothing but pain in the futureIf this is what life is like I do not want to carry onI am thinking of my favourite song so they can play it at my funeralMy heD feels like it's going to blow up I can't carry on I need help , but will I get it I WANT TO DIE SO BAD
