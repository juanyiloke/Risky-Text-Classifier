How do you approach depression with a GP?    fee25Hey guys,ÊI've never posted on a forum before, let alone about something so personal but here we go anyway, hopefully it'll help.ÊI've been struggling an awful lot with life, I spend all day lying in bed because facing the world seems so difficult, I never go in to Uni anymore and my grades have gone downhill - which is a massive shame especially as I am in my third and final year. I isolate myself from all my friends and housemates, I feel so low all of the time and I have been self harming because - even though this may sound odd - self harm is the only thing I seem to do that feels productive (even though I am aware it isn't).ÊI know why I feel this way, I was raped in November and although I convinced myself that I would be perfectly fine after a few weeks, I'm really not. I have finally come to a point where I want to seek help from my GP but I have absolutely no idea how to start the conversation - do I discuss the abuse first, the self harm, the depression and how would I even lead into that conversation?ÊAll I know is that I want to move forward but the thought of seeing my gp is terrifying me. I did once open up to a friend of mine about what was going on but I felt absolutely no relief whatsoever, instead I felt ashamed and embarrassed for opening up even though this friend was lovely about everything. Will seeing my gp help or will I just end up running out of there screaming?
