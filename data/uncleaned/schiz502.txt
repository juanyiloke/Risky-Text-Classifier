ÊHi everyone, I'm newHi everyone!I'm new to this forum, am currently an inpatient at a mental health hospital, anf have been for 6 months now. I have Psychosis, severe OCD which is linked to my delusions, PTSD, and severe anxiety. My problems started since I was 8 years old. I thought that my food as going down a side tube in my neck and not going down my actual throat. I would keep touching my throat as I swallowed to try and reassure myself it was going don the right way. Then when I was 9, I started getting this awful, shaky, overwhelming, scary feeling, a bit like a panic attack. This happened every night for quite a long time.Then when I was 10, my family moved country so I had to settle in at a country where I didn't even know the language very well. The school was also very different and pressurising, and I got bullied. I started having OCD type thoughts. and had to do a lot of repeating and counting.The same year, I started getting paranoid that my mum was poisoning me. I had to keep asking her whether she had poisoned my food.Then it started to get worse and I was suspecting a lot of people who didn't like me anted to poison me. The reassurance seeking got worse. I was now paranoid about people putting harmful substances in my food, drink, clothes, my stuff, to try and cause me harm.Then last year july I couldn't eat anything, and lost a lot of weight and as admitted to a mental health hospital, where I stayed until this year March. Then I started having thoughts that someone had put something in my eyes and ears so that hat I was seeing and hearing was what they wanted me to see and hear. I got admitted to a mental hospital again this year July. I'm still there now, but I'm on home leave for christmas. Because of my hospital admissions, I couldn't do my GCSEs and I'm missing so much college at the moment, which is really hard.Thank you if you've taken the time to read this.Madi x
