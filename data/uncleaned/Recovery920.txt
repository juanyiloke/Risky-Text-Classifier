Life saverTonight I realized today was the first day I haven't cried in months. It's an amazing feeling for me and although the pain in my chest tells me I'm far from actually being ok , getting through this day with tears only in my heart and not on my face is amazing. Whoever made this forum , I thank you with all of my being, you are indeed a LIFE SAVER. Everyone who offers support here, you are all ANGELS! Being so lonely for such a long time made me forget what it's like to have someone genuinely interested in what's going on with you, without any hidden interest. Getting feedback on my cries for help and talking to some great people made this day notable and gave me a little something to hold on to. I just hope I can use this help to gain some force , or at least not feel so lost. THANK YOU !
