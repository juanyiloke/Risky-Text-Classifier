are you an introvert?ive had anxiety for years now, ive took beta blockers for almost a year, which help with the physical symptoms. but there starting to creep back in. though the medication has helped, i feel like im isolating myself from eyeryone rather than having to deal with any anxiety. Im married, im not close with my family, and ive excluded myself from all my friends gradually over the past year or two. i work but i find it really difficult to talk to my colleagues, or anyone really, i find it very stressful, and will avoid at all costs. im reaching out, does anyone have the same issues? ive become very introverted and unsocial, angry and judgemental, beacuse im unhappy with GAD and depression.
