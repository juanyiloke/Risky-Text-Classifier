cant copeHi I have advanced bowel cancer which has spread to my lungs. There is no treatment left for me so I am on palliative care with a few months left to live. I am 45 years old with adult children and a baby granddaughter. I want to keep fighting and so do my family but nobody told me it would be so hard. It's taken me an hour to get up and dressed this morning as everything is so exhausting. Going up the stairs takes 15 min as I have to keep stopping to catch my breath. I try to keep upbeat but I'm starting to feel like I just want to give up and stay in bed all day. And I don't seem to be getting the help I need from Macmillan or the doctor s , it's like banging my head against a brick wall.
