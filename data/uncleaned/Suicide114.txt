Need Help NowNeed help now. Put myself on meds through psychiatrist for PTSD and anxiety. Mislabeled Bipolar symptoms due to depression and suicidal ideations from my physical health and finacial income being too low. But, all I ever have been depressed about is my finances and physical health that has been bad since birth (been in and out of the hospital for malnutrition due to a messed up digestive system since the age of 2, possibly caused from being a premie, and neuromuscular problems now making it worse). The main point: I feel I don't want to suffer, anymore, from my physical pain and health problems plus struggle anymore to keep up to normal weight and also better income (I have a degree I got while on disability, but no one hiring a disabled person). So, so tired of it all. This is my last reach out for help.
