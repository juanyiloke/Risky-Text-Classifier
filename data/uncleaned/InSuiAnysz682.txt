I have had one of those bad days. They come quite often. I get down and out and I do not want to talk to anyone. BUt when I try to talk to someone, I notice there isn't anyone. No one that I know understands me. They just say "it'll be ok. You'll get through it. Your not the only one. It COULD be WORSE." I get sick and tired of hearing the same thing. No one listens.ÊI am in my second year of college attending full time and I just cannot seem to pass any of my work. I guess I am not intelligent enough. Ill never live my dreams. I work full time, but I don't make enough to pay my bills nor get me a place to live. I have more bills than people think and they just say "oh your parents probably pay for everything. You got it made." No dammit I dont. I live with a drunk, but she works full time. We hardly talk. She is my mom.ÊI am in love with my best friend who is a female and has a bf and is happy I suppose. They've only been together for about 6 months. Ive known her for 12 years and nothing. I am a lesbian but my family shunned me and my friends rarely talk to me anymore.ÊI am depressed and I want to take my own life.ÊI hope someone out there udnerstands.
