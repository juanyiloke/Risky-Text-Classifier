too late to catch up? unmotivated please helpby Lpoolem30Hi im new to this and really need some help and advice. I am a mature student (31 next wk) and am currently on my 2nd year of Psychology Hons. I have had a lot of family issues the last year which have massively affected my study leaving me 6 papers behind all being due within 4 weeks plus 3 exams. Im thinking of just quitting now an resitting the year as i feel im too far behind and would like to just concentrate on myself the next few months also i am gettin marrried in june but that is not whats distracted and sidelined me. does anyone know what my options are? where do i stand with this. i feel if i push myself to do well it may be a wasted effort as im doomed to fail anyways as my attendance is next to nothing too. dont want to give in but dont want to waste the next 6 weeks pushing and stressing myself out for nothin.
