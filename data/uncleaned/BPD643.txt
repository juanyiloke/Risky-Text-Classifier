I Have Borderline Personality DisorderMy borderline is getting worse these few days.I have sort of over dosing on anxiety pills.Between the trade off of being in extreme pain,and being somewhat okay I chose whatever sense of sanity I get.But I am on 6 pills a day nowadays.I need to find real life substitutes.Hey,at least I am not suicidal.I hate letting people down.I just ruined a relationship with my co founder.The right word would be back-stabbed him.I was in rage,over something he said.I have no way to fix this.I will try to make his life easier,in some weird way.He doesn't know yet,but he will know soon.I hate that I am this person.I used to be better.I hate this,because really I am so many things before my disorder.I used to be creative,imaginative,happy,well euphoric rather,conscientious good thing with integrity,miss sunshine sort of girl.I used to always dissociate,but maybe to my own dream world. I was not so vacillating so poisonous.I used to be me,whatever me was,and I loved being me.I really loved being me once.On the other side of hell, I wish I could get back that person. I need hope,religion or anything.I need to make me right.I won't find a relationship or do all that get married things till I sort this out.I want to have a family one day.Little kids ,that I swear by God,I will do everything to ensure they grow up healthy and strong.If I don't heal from this,I won't have kids.They don't deserve this pain.They don't deserve me ,well nothing deserves me,not even me.But I am much more than this disorder.I keep denying love to me,and then I feel so so lonely.I am so ****** up.Where to start fixing the chaos?I am so ******* messed up.I am lucky,people still keep trying to reach me.God bless them,I would never do that for me.I am a ******* monster.But I used to be better.I swear,I used to be better.Now I don't know who I am anymore.
