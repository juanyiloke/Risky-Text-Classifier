Financial TradingHi all just wandered if we could get a discussion going about trading on the stock market, have recently retired and think i might have a dabble at it with some of my lump sum. I have not got much experience in this area though and was wandering if anyone has? Ive seen a couple of companies that offer startup training in this field and again wander if anyone has been on any of these training courses got any ideas about where to start???
