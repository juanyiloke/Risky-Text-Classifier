Why I think all diabetics should have a CGMIt might be stating the obvious, but having been lucky enough to have had a CGM for a brief time, it's obvious to me how amazing they are. Most notably when you are out and about and it's not easy to check BS levels. Of course, they are very expensive, but so were mobile phones once and over the years they have become very affordable pieces of kit so I'm very excited to see what technology advancements are brought out over the next 10 years.Having said that, I really believe all diabetics should be allowed access to a CGM for at least a few weeks. I have learned alot about what my BS level does during the day and more importantly during the night which allowed me and my health professional to adjust insulin doses and eating habits and my HBA1C has come right down because of it (form 7% - 6.1%).They might be expensive to the NHS, but how expensive is dealing with long term complications?
