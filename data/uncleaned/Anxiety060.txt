new to anxiety and absolutely terrified. please help me.I have been diagnosed with anxiety and its taking over my life.I am utterly convinced im having a heart attack or going to have one in the very near future.I get racing heart beat, palpitations. Pains in the middle of my chest, down my left arm and my body washes over with this feeling of hot butterflies in my tummy kind of feeling. I am utter exhausted with this and convinced these mini heart attacks are just preludes to the main event.I have rang 111 twice in 3 weeks utterly petrified and in a bad emotional state. I had bloods taken 2     but no ecg's.I can't live feeling like im waiting to die on a daily basis. This has hit me out of nowhere. I'm 31 with 2 small kids and not ready to die. What is happening to me??? Im typing this through the tears because ive just had one and they just seem to be getting worse.
