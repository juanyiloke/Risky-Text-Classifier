ÊQuestion about therapy?Hi, I'm new here, though I was in and out here since 2011. I was recently diagnosed with BPD (and not happy about it) after years and years of being misdiagnosed and undiagnosed etc. I am trying to process a lot at present and one of the questions I have is,,,,why did therapy never work for me?..I have had several therapists over the years but it never worked for me. I think, and wondering if it is just me...is that, the reason therapy never worked is because I was never truly 'present' and when I had therapy I was constantly trying to get across to the therapist that I was in terrible pain. Also, I believe that I suffer from Depersonalization so as a result, I am thinking now, that while in therapy, that I was so disconnected from reality that it was probably impossible for me to take in what was going on. I don't suppose it really matters now but I would love to know if anyone else has had this experience with therapy? I am waiting to see a Psychologist(there's quite a waiting list) but feel now that as I am a lot older I wonder if there is any point at all in going???? Thanks in advance. Nicky.
