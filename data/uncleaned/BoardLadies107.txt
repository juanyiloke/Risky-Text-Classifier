horrible morningHi all, I just had a really scary incident and needed to vent. I was just walking into work,and someone in front of me dropped their phone. I picked it up and jogged up to them and gave it back, all grand.But then this group of 3 guys with a big dog started screaming ' excuse me excuse me' mimicking me, then started shouting that I was a whore and a tramp and a slut and be careful no-one pushes me under a bus. They followed me for ages and I got stuck beside them at a busy junction all the while they were screaming at me. I finally lost them but I'm so shakey now. I don't even.know why I'm posting I kind of just didn't know what to do!
