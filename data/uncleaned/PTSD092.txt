Threats Of Physical Violence To A ChildThis feels like a dumb question, but I'll ask it anyway. Can ongoing threats of physical violence (verbal and gestural) be traumatizing to a child? Even if the person says they were "just kidding" later and also never hit the child? I have some "memories" that relate to physical violence, but I am almost 100% certain I was never hit. I actually remember challenging him to hit me once when I was a young teenager. I stood up to him and said, "Go ahead and hit me. I know you want to. But you won't." That really got me in deep sht. I know various threats of harm happened pretty much daily. Do you suppose a child can morph a threat into something that seems like amemory but isn't? For example, my father used to hold his fist very close to my face and say he'd shove it down my throat. I know he never did. And yet the memories are pretty visceral and intrusive...
