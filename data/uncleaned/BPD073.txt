Anyone else constantly irritable?by cupoftea22 » Thu May 28, 2015 1:43 pmIve been diagnosed with BPD for a few years now, but in the last year or so I feel constantly Grumpy and irritable. I snap at everyone, its like constant PMS. My symptoms seem to have changed a bit, I used to feel okay some of the time but would have rages, but now instead of a big blow up every so often its just constantly annoyed. the tiniest things, or sometimes nothing make me want to scream. I snap at people ALL the time. I have no idea if its the BPD and why it changed to this but if anyone else is going through the same thing or can help let me know, thanks?
