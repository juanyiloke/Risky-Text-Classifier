What Can You Glean From Old Photographs?There are very few photos of me as a baby or kid. I don't actually expect to understand much through looking at them. I know I have developmental trauma stuff. So for me it's kind of interesting to see that I looked like a newborn at 2 months. I also looked dead (not peaceful sleeping but not stiff, just dead-like and not at all connected to whatever was holding me). Beyond the dead-looking months, I look scared in any pic where someone is holding me...mom, another relative...doesn't matter. I'm smiling in some photos when I'm on my own, in my own space.No pics of me as a newborn (no pics until I came home from hospital). And then up until about a year old, they are depressing to me. I'm actually not going to make much of it. But without finding the exact words, it makes sense. I have pictures from early adulthood that remind me how void I was...can't believe I survived that level of shutdown. The "me" or living person was so muted. I still feel that sometimes but try to function above it. It's hard to relate to all of these versions of myself.Do you feel anything looking at old pictures (whether from childhood or before or after trauma)? Have they ever helped you put together any lose pieces?
