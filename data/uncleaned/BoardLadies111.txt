HouseworkCan anyone in the history of human kind ever have a rational conversation about housework without flying off the handle. If so I would like to meet them.I agreed that we should have a timetable for housework in fact it was my idea after one person in particular started getting annoyed with the state of the place but I wanted to discuss what form the timetable would take. There is one person who I will admit was doing the majority of the tasks but they said nothing and their anger has built up to such an extent that you can't even discuss how things should be done.I thought we should do a rota for example where one person does the hoovering, the other person does the bathroom, the other the weeding, the other cleans fridge oven and etc., as a weekly rota of some shape or form and then the next week the tasks change and you are doing a different one.But what has transpired is there is a list of tasks and a weekly template and people have to pick a task and then sign the list to say they did that task that they picked. There is no rhyme or reason or logic to it. The problem with this is I think some tasks are more desirable than others i.e. nobody will want to do the bathroom. I would consider half an hour of cleaning the bathroom not equal to 10 minutes of taking out the trash and cleaning the fridge. Also I don't have a clue how much I should do because it's a blank canvas. I want to plan my cleaning. Okay Saturday I will clean the bathroom. Thursday night is my night to mop the floor. Something disciplined.Can anybody with experience of timetabling household duties tell me what works the most effectively.
