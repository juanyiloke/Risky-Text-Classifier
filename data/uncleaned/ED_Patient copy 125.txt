AdmissionI am bulimic and have been so for a few months. Im very thin anyway because a few years a go I dieted and lost about 3 stone (and I wasn't even fat in the start) and then I got obsessed with eating healthily. Now though things have changed...I am sick four of five times a day, maybe more. I don't even mind being sick, I have become an expert at it and can do it in2 seconds flat without even putting my fingers down my throat, which means it is really easy to kep it a secret from my family. In one way it feels good to know I am in total otrol and will never get fatter but in another way it is bad because I know it's weird and wrong and I keep craving weet foods cos my bodies getting used to them (unusual for me cos I used to eatso healthily.) I keep telling mself that's it and i'll stop but I guess deep down I know i'm kidding myself. The worst thing is dceiving people I care about. I know I have the will power to beat this somewhre in meand I hope that i shall manage it..Maybe if I take small steps like cutting back. Sometimes bulimia makes me feel so alone so it's good to write about it to other poeple who feel the same and understand!
