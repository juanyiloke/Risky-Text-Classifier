Nose cast - public/work viewing??Long loongg looonnggg story but wud u be seen in public with nose cast on after broken nose surgery?ÊNext question, would u go into work with said nose cast on?Third question, would you go into work with said nose cast plus glasses placed awkwardly on top of nose cast coz as blind as bat OR .......Pull sicky?All males I talk to are too logical and say if feel ok then fine, but me, I look like a right twat and feel there is no way I can go into work looking like I don't know what. Opinions please :-)
