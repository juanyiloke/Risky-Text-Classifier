I think I'm bulimic.I'm scared what should I do?My bulimia started just a few months ago. I'm not sure if I'm really bulimic because I don't have the time to consult pro's and I'm still a student that's why I can't afford to pay for a checkup. I think I'm disciplined and I don't eat fatty foods.. I only eat oats,milk , breads or sweet potatoes& something like super yummy boiled veggies. BUT sometimes I over eat ( breads) and whenever I over eat I feel like throwing up(and I do throw up) I don't want to get fat that's why i'm doing that...I'm aware that if I binge eat, I might get some disease but I can't avoid it. today, my friend asked me to go to her birthday. because she's my friend I can't say no to her. I end up eating her favorite fatty unhealthy foods. I was so scared when I got home. I vomit again. I don't want to do that again . but how can I stop it? to be honest I'm only 17yrs old. I still don't know what to do if I get sick because of this. my family is not aware and I'm to ashamed to tell them..
