Some advice re sex lifeHi,Kinda awkward so i will go unreg.Am 35 yo male, never kissed a girl let alone sex or anything - not gay either. Was shy at school, lived at home during college years and not huge into drinking - basically a perfect storm for not mixing and meeting people, so stuck my head down and got along with college.ÊThen the years just past, any friends I have are gone off to different places - basically just alone now. Seems like I missed out on that period where meeting girls and learning the do's and do nots parts. Sex wise, just use porn whenever I "need" to, but honestly thats only once or twice a week, chat up girls on website for phone sex type stuff - more from utter boredom than anything else.Tried online dating, met two girls in 2 years neither replied to any texts - so im guessing im not that great looking. Have asked out three girls in a coffee shop type situation - awful experience but had to be done or else the "crush" would have driven me insane.Guess just wanted to chat about this with other guys in private, not really something I could ever chat about with a friend. Sorry for a rambling post but just felt let getting this off my chest and maybe hopefully get some useful advice.
