I just don't know how to get the right balance for my family and its just causing me great upset. Ive 3 kids 3, 4 & 5. The youngest is in an autism centre, the second is playing up all the time and just doesn't respond to any sort of reasonable discipline, and the eldest is falling behind at school as they don't get the time they need from me for reading and writing practice. Im studying for a Masters and have constant deadlines that are just so difficult to meet although that ends in Summer. I'm working till 1am and not doing my best work. Im exhausted. We just moved house and its still in disarray and I don't have the time to organize it. Husband is stressed at work trying to pay for all this. Family are all miles and miles away and can't afford any help. I need to get back to work after the summer as we're struggling financially, even with parents help, but I don't know how workable this is having a special needs child and all his appointments, not to mention the needs of the other two. I've put on 10 kilos in as many months as my drug of choice is chocolate and I feel shit about myself. I know they say to schedule in exercise but unless I do it at 4am I simply don't know how thats possible. I've not had a decent nights sleep in many years, there is never a night where we're not woken at least twice. Well I'm on my knees and apart from winning the lottery and hiring Supernanny I just don't know what can give Feel better for writing that down tho….
