Êdo you have days when...Before being diagnosed with PTSD, my husband used to tell me I "must" be bipolar because some days were better than others. I don't have the highs and lows. I'm always low anymore, just once in a while, sometimes I have a day or a few where I feel lower than other days. Today is one of those days. One of those days when the flashbacks seem to be more intense, and more of the in quantity. The panic attacks are more intense and longer lasting that usual. And I'm just really down today and can't seem to pick myself up even slightly. So, all this leaves me to wonder, do you have days like that? Are there days when you feel you just can't get up and moving at all, yet most days, with effort, you can get yourself to at least accomplish something? Do you have days when the symptoms of the PTSD is more prevalent than other days? Or is it just me like that? Last week, I was down, low, but it was an almost tolerable low, almost to where I was functioning as I "should" but yesterday and today... ugh... I was fumbling and dropping things at work last night, was caught spacing off twice. Last week, I spaced off once the entire week. now, in two days time, I've zoned out several times already. Just curious if this is common for others too?
