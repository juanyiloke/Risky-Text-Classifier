The Reverse Bucket-ListMaking a bucket list is, I have found (having made a couple) a really good way to make yourself feel crappy and overwhelmed. So many things you think you should do but kinda don't really want to, so many things you really want to do and are worried you can't/won't, so many things.....So. This is the reverse bucket list. Stuff you have ALREADY done that made a significant impact on your life and contributed to who you are today and/or were noteworthy in some way.1. I trained to be a teacher and taught for five years, making at least some impact on the lives of a few hundred kids.2. I climbed to the top of St Peter's Basilica in Rome (not something to do if you are in any way claustrophobic)3. I dropped out of uni twice, and graduated uni twice - once with a bachelors degree and once with a masters level degree4. I traveled to another continent.5. I fell in love - hard.6. I retrained for a new profession from scratch and am making a success of it.7. I lost everything and rebuilt my life from the ground up8. I performed solo in front of an audience on a few occasions and despite feeling like I might, did not die of fear.9. I learned to play a musical instrument to a high standard10. I had paintings exhibited in a public space.What have you already done (and please do NOT add to this thread with negative "I have done nothing ever" type comments because a) Its not helpful and b) Its not true, however much you try to persuade yourself it is!)
