Êrepressed one event, depressed about anotherHi.In 2010 I was placed in a psych hospital. It was so bad there, but I don't know how to describe it because I repressed most of it. I remember snippets, like my girlfriend. But it's like im watching them happen through my own eyes. Like it happened to me but I don't have the feelings or the body memories.ÊAbout 6 months ago I was sexually assaulted in another psych hospital, and I remember it, and I feel a lot of guilt and regret about it. I'm just really depressed about it.My question is if I had one reaction to trauma the first time, why would I not have the same reaction to the sexual assault?
