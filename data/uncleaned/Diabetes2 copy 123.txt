Taking insulin in the morning and weight gainHello everyone  This is a post cencerning my dad. He got stress related diabetes when he was 44. So it's a type 2 diabetes (i guess haha... i know nothing about it, but he asked me to post a question here).So here it is. His enocrynologist told him to take insulin in the morning instead of evening. He is very active, fit even, but he's been unable to lose belly fat despite the efforts. He's been eating very clean (ocassional junk food like once a month or so) and he's been doing a lot of physical work, but muffin top just won't go away.Also, what's the difference between taking the insulin in the mornning and in the evening, given that during the day you eat and during the night not? He never had this problem whilst he was taking it in the evening.Could any of you, please, tell me what is the cause of this? And has any of you had any experience with it?
