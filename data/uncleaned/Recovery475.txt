  been through hell and backRead this link and you will read the very low points in my depression  but there are so many I couldn't write them all. My loved ones supported me very much and the for first time in my life I do not want to die. My issue now is that I went through so much that pain became my comfort  zone and these new feelings are so foriegn to me I don't know how to handle myself. What keeps coming to mind is the Nirvana lyric "I miss the comfort in being sad." On the upside I feel like I'm on some sort of superdrug  24/7. I actually think I can beat this thing.
