Hi, I'm new to this site and am not sure what I'm doing but here goes! I was born to what I call demons, who constantly fought day in day out, no holds barred. they divorced and we then had police protection 24/7 on the door step, from my violent dad and I was 3 years old at that point.from there I was sexually abused by my uncle from the age of 5 until I was 10. mum was a prostitute and was always bringing back uncles unrelated to us. from the age of 9 was sexually abused by my older brother up until I was around 12/13. we moved house every few months all my life. at the age of 13, I became a run away and live on the streets. from 14 I went into care and at the age of 15 I met my ex-husband who treat me exactly the same way. beating me daily and taking sex when ever he wanted too regardless of what I wanted, this continued for 17 years up until I was 31. he and my best friend of 16 years then got together in a relationship and took everything I ever worked for. my children(4) my house, car, household furniture, clothes, everything. I have since spent the last 10 years of my life living alone and scared to leave my house. I cannot speak to people or have any kind of friendship or relationship with anybody. so I drink and I no that is not the answer but I'm stuck in a vicious circle and don't know how to get out. I cannot socialise or trust anybody and every one around me in the outside world reminds me of my past. anything can trigger memories, from footstep, banging doors or just smells. I'm not sure if I do suffer from PTSD but my nurse seems to think so. I hope you can help from this information and give me a clue if I do or don't. thank you for taking the time to read my message. good luck to you all and take good care. Sharon xxx
