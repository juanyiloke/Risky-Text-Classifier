hopeless boss!________________________________________Hi, in work with a team of about 20 people, there is one boss, three managers, and about 16 between administration and operations. The work we do is providing a non core service to a larger company.The problem, and all 19 agree is the boss. Totally incompetent. If we approach him, we get eaten, our words are twisted, and no benefit is gained from the conversation. If we come up with an idea, he presents it as his own and we get no recognition for it, not even a well done.. So we don't bother giving the good ideas any more.If there is a specific rule in place, we have to follow it. If we don't we are spoken to like children. Then he goes and breaks it because it suits him at the time.9 smoke breaks a day, and if we turn up late. . .you get the driftAny emails sent by him, are, please review, I will revert in due course, will never commit to anything.He still manages to keep in with his boss, who is the client, and discourages any of us forming a relationship with his boss.Everyone else says the same, he is useless, he is on a power tripHuman resources won't come near the place. They are in the management click of the company, and only care about the managers. In fact we haven't seen human resources in over a year.So how do you deal with a boss like this?
