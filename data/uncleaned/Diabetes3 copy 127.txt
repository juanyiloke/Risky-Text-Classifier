travel bag for all these medical suppliesHi, we will be travelling long haul for our first holiday since my daughter became diabetic type 1. I wonder if there are any recommendations on a travel bag for all the medical supplies we now have to travel with. When I look on the internet there are so many types and suggestions that its over powering. Half of it is advertising and I wonder if you could share from experience what has worked well. I do have the cooler pockets for keeping insulin cool but need one bag to carry on board to hold everything. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
