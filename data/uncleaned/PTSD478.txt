Êis this the place?I know that this forum is meant to provide a support to those who have struggled with traumatic events and find comfort in the group/solidarity in similarity. However, I'm in desperate need of talking out some things in a little bit of detail in a more detached medium, is this the place for that? I want to talk about this with my therapist, but I need to practice a little first. I'm tired of attempting to tell her things and finding myself dissociation or having full blown flashbacks in her presence. Is there some way I could tell you all or someone what has happened, or is this not the place?
