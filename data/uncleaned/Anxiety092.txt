Lexapro side effects? Ê28    So I'm taking 5mg Lexapro and I don't know of its just my anxiety or if these are side effects. I'm on my second day and I already want to give up.. I take them at 8pm and I can't sleep, when I go I have crazy thoughts (weird ones I can't really remember) then I start feeling like I'm going crazy and get into a panic attack. So far it hasn't lasted long but I feel like its getting worse. I had a horrible headache last night, I don't know what's wrong with me.. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Will this pass? Should I stay on the medication?

Shoulder Pain Ê13    So as of lately I've been feeling better (somewhat) but after I started talking about my anxiety and what brought it on to my mom my shoulder started to hurt again. It's like a sharp pain and I usually have it so I'm really wondering if I should go to a chiropractor.I actually do want to go to a chiropractor but my mom continues to tell me that I'm too young for that and that I shouldn't worry about things like this.Daughters sick bug making anxiety kick in!! Ê10    Hi, my daughter started with a sick bug on Wednesday night. I'm totally paranoid about catching it as I have health anxiety and w phobia of being sick! I've steam cleaned my house, disinfected and washed my hands about a thousand times. She is only 3 so I've been stuck in the house with her for 3  . She seems to be getting better, but my husband started with it last night. My anxiety has now gone in to overdrive I don't know what to do, I'm terrified of getting it. Feel like I have heartburn, pains in stomach and nausea but I've had this for 3   is it just my anxiety??
