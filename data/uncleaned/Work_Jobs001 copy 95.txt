Money owed by employer________________________________________Hi, my partner is currently on maternity leave, she is a part time hairdresser. Throughout the Christmas period I had been telling her she should receive some form of tax back in the new year, as the tax she had paid in 2014 would match up close to her tax free allowance/ tax credit.She has received her P60. (I will attach it if I can)Now I want to know if I have this correct or if I am missing something.I make out her nett by this for 2014 should be 10,824.81. However her bank statement says she got paid 10,475.36. The difference being 349.45. She never gets paid cash/cheque.Today, she made a quick call to her employer querying this, who after chatting to the bookkeeper & accountant has come back saying that she was "overpaid in 2012 & 2013 and this was just balancing things out". The employer has said she has a load of paper work which my partner can take down to the tax office and they will verify what the employer says is the case.Now her employer is very nice, genuinely. However I feel the reply is just an excuse as they have been caught out. Or the bookkeeper (employers mother) has made a mess and is feeding the naive employer an excuse, which they are happy to go along with so as not to pay out the measly Û350.My partner has also found out she should have also been paid one fifth of her weekly wage for each bank holiday for the last 3 years, which she never received. Approx Û400 per year.She has not said anything about this as yet and was going to wait until St. Patricks Day.We don't want to do anything legal, and won't. Its just not worth it life-wise. Money is not everything. Do my sums add up, or am I wrong? Also does the employers reason make sense/ can it be legit?Thanks
