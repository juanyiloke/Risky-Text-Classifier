Asthma, undiagnosis, low oxygen sats, help? It's been a long time since I was last on this forum!Just to quickly give some background, I've been diagnosed asthmatic for 7 years now and it was always well controlled until 2 years ago when I started getting breathless on exertion (I was training as an oboist at the time so breathlessness was very unusual!) I was put on various preventers and relievers as well as steroid tablets but nothing helped. I was sent to a respiratory consultant who ran various tests but all he found was that my heart rate was quite fast (120 beats per minute at rest, up to 199 on exertion).As a result, he took me off my asthma medicines, suspecting that asthma might not be the cause of my breathlessness and the relievers might be increasing my heart rate as a side effect. When I was safely off them all, he checked my heart again and it was beating at the same high rate. So he sent me to a cardiologist. I should mention that at this point my oxygen sats had always been 98-100, even mid asthma attack.I saw the cardiologist a couple of weeks ago. She checked my oxygen sats and they were 96, then she sent me on a walk and they dropped to 89. She couldn't explain that and wants to get me back in for more tests (I've had heart scans done and they've been fine). The only medication I take now is pulmicort as a reliever twice a day. Is 89 pretty low for oxygen levels? I'm still getting breathless every day and my asthma is triggered when I'm around things like aeorosols or smoke, but as I have no reliever I just have to wait until it gets better. But the doctors are reluctant to put me back on relievers when my heart rate is still high - they think there is another undiagnosed cause for my breathlessness.I'm feeling so breathless and tired every day and those oxygen sats kind of freaked me out a bit! Is 89 low, or am I worrying over nothing? Any advice greatly appreciated!!
