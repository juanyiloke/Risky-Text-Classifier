Ever since the recall of the Asda dummies I've been paranoid about all my babies dummies. She never had an Asda one, but she has a whole variety. Some basic cherry dummies, some orthodontic avent ones and some mam ones.I've given them all a pull and they feel secure (although now I'm worried I've loosened them!!) and my baby doesn't have any teeth yet so very unlikely to be worn.Now my baby is sleeping in her own room (just turned 6 months) I'm lying in bed thinking about her bloody dummy breaking!!!!Am I just being neurotic?!Which brand would you say are definitely safe?
