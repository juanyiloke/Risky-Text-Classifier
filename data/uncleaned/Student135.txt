Catered vs Self-catered?by thelmldonHi all,I'm considering what UCL accommodation to apply for right now, and trying in my mind to weigh up the benefits and costs of catered and self-catered accommodation. The clearest points for each that I can think of is:Catered - self-responsibility on tight budget to purchase main meals (which takes up quite a large proportion) is taken off you, allowing you more money for nicetiesSelf-catered - cooking is a good social activity, great to meet people in your corridor/hall, and if you want to make something special outside of the staple meals you get (such as a birthday cake) you are free to do so!People already living that uni life - which is better?
