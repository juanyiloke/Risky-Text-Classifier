Is taking Risperidone really worth the risk?by Enigma316 » Fri Dec 23, 2011 5:30 amI've recently been prescribed Risperidone and diagnosed with schizophrenic tendencies. Part of me feels this medication can greatly help me since I do have a lot of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and I've heard it also works for tourette syndrome, so it's killing two birds with one stone. I've noticed an improvement with my tics and I do feel calmer when around people. The only real problem is that it makes me tired which really isn't that big of a problem. Here's what worries me though. Everywhere I look I find comments, articles, and videos about people saying how bad Risperidone is. How it's made them feel like a zombie and how it's the most dangerous medication out there with patients dying at an early age and the medication causing serious problems. It's made me feel terrified that this medication is going to screw me up and I'm not sure what to do. My schizophrenia doesn't pose a significant problem and the hallucinations are very minimal, but I will admit I do have problems. I spend 24/7 inside and I can't be around people. I feel like this medication could be the key to helping me, but I just don't know what to do. Is it really worth the risk to continue taking this medication, or am I better off stopping it while I still can? My fear is if I stay on this medication I'll end up regretting it later on in life, but on the other hand I fear if I get off of it now my schizophrenia may worsen later in life. It's very manageable now and I rarely experience hallucinations. I'd rather experience a long life of selcusion without worrieing about dying and heath problems than have a happy life where I might end up dying earlier than I should have. Maybe I'm just paranoid, so that's why I need another persons opinion. The doctor prescribed me this without taking one second to mention any risks this medication poses, so I don't trust a thing he'll tell me.
