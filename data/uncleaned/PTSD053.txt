Danger Around Every Corner No LongerWhen I was working I was always on. New situations everyday, feeling that your doing something important, and being part of the team.ÊNow it seems no matter what I try to do I know in the back of my head it's not really anything important. That pilot light has went out never to be lit again. I can't get excited about anything. It's a very empty feeling.I'm always looking for something to occupy my mind. I build and design something in my head. I go out to the shop and after twenty minutes I realize it's not important and I just give up on the project.It doesn't really seem to matter.
