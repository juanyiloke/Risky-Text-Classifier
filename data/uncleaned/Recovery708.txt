something that is working for meHi there, This is my 1st time on here. I have been thinking about sharing a few things that are really working for me at the moment. Im 41years old a mother of 2 married. I have  experienced depression.. anxiety and just general mood changes for a while.. on and off   since I was a kid. I know that certain events or situations really tip me over.. but now Im a bit older I can recognise the signs and I can usually catch it in time! The one thing I do that generally keeps me well is exercise.. I know this is just the usual advice.. but I know for a fact.. i'm up on the days I exercise and if I go a few days week without my walk run etc.. I start to slip down that slope. So if you feel flat / low / anxious/ agitated..  get your shoes on and go outside for a walk run swim whatever just move for 20-30mins.. it will buy you some time! I have managed better with exercise than I ever did on medication... just me but just saying.. anyhoo.. I hope you are all having a good day and I'd love to chat on here sometime. See ya
