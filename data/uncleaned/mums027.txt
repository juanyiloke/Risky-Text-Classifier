I'm really panicking right now. I have a 3 week old and sleep deprivation is starting to kick in. I'm having flashbacks to last night where I picked the baby up from the floor next to the Moses basket.ÊI can't tell if this actually happened or if it was some sort of a dream.ÊIf it did happen then how did he end up on the floor? Did I fall asleep while feeding him and drop him???ÊThere have been a few other occasions where I think something's happened but it was just some form of dream. Nothing major-for example I've woken up thinking I need to put milk I've just expressed into the fridge but it turns out I haven't actually expressed yet.
