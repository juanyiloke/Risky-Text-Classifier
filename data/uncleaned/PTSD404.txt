 Rocking and Holding for rewiring of the trauma brain???I've been wanting to get back to yoga again. I had stop the classes at the gym because my unethical T worked out there and it was too painful to continue with all the memories of him and the chance of seeing him again. So I started going to my college's gym a few years ago only to run right into him. You would think I would stop running into him since I have moved over 3 hours away. But I saw the jerk in a popular brew pub in town a few months ago. I don't understand why we keep running into each other, it bothers me. I hope I can remove the triggers of him and my PTSD because of him so I can feel safe working out again. I have gained all my weight back.  I am going to start walking at a local park. Exercise is good for my PTSD. But I really want to find a good yoga class. But about this article, I wonder what they mean by holding and rocking. I am not sure I could ever get to the point of allowing any T to do that. Maybe my older T I was with a long time. Her hugs were healing. Gosh do I miss that.
