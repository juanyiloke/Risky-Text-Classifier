Cost of Student Living: Article for a Magazineby PaigelminnsHi All,Am writing an article on the cost of student living in the UK (something I know we're all very passionate about!) and I wanted to get your thoughts. So,What issues ave you experienced with Student Finance? E.G loans not covering rent, coming through late, being based on parents income etc.If you work, how many hours do you work a week, and does this interrupt your studies at all? What do you feel are the 'hidden' costs of student living that SFE simply don't take into account?Thanks!
