Hello! looking for help and direction please xHello,I am 24 and have been suffering from an ED for 10+ years now. Long story short I was bullied and overweight at high school. I went on strict diet & exercise plan and was diagnosed with Anorexia. Went in patient , came out maintained healthy weight continued to try and make a life for myself without it being dominated by my ED.ÊFast forward a few years and i lost my Mother and Gran. I relapsed into full blown Bulimia / BED. It has spiralled out of control SO quickly. Not going into detail but my binges are out of control. I try to eat as best I can during the day but the nights are the worse. It's almost as if I am not in control of my mind or body anymore. I am possessed. So it feels like.ÊI DO want recovery but it is so hard! I have been to my GP and he weighed me and basically said there is no help for me as my BMI does not fall within a certain " danger " category.I have been searching for support groups and came across the " OA fellowship " It focuses on same principles of recovery as AA but i am not sure about it.ÊSo yeah just thought i would post & i am very grateful for finding this site. I have been reading a good few inspiring posts!.xxxxxx
