Turmeric and cooking ideasHi allI've read in many places about the advantages of turmeric and its beneficial effects on the liver. As I've got liver mets, I'd like to build more of this into my diet - unfortunately one of the foods I've gone right off is curries, so need some other ideas. Would something as simple as sprinkling turmeric over my food be of use or am I over simplifying things? I've also read something about needing to take it in conjunction with black pepper (another taste I can't stomach at the moment). Is that right?I've also read (albeit mostly on US sites) that it's possible to get capsules of circumin, the active ingredient of turmeric and take those instead. Does anyone have any experience of that?ThanksJon
