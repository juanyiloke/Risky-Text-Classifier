  I am over him!!I was feeling really badly about a break-up after living together for a year, and I just felt that I couldn't ever find someone again. I really had been bummed out. I joined an internet site, and posted my 'bio' and some pictures, and although the people who responded were not '100% who I think I should be with' I have been speaking to varous guys, and met 2 (today I went to the Bronx Zoo) and what I found in speaking to these people, they have been just as bummed out about a break up as I had been. So, now, I am less angry, and more hopeful that one day I can meet someone really special. I suppose that at least now, I can be more hopeful now that I know that I can find someone that 'might get me'.
