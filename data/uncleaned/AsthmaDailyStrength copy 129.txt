I understand I should talk to my doctor but I was wondering if anyone would have some insight on what I'm experiencing. I was sick with a cold 2 weeks ago and stupidly decided that I could not miss a 10k race. I could barely run it and my asthma flared soon after. Last weekend it got worse and I ended up being placed on a medrol dose pack, double my asmanex for a week and breathing tx 2 times a day. I usually end up on a medrol dose pack at least once every 2-3months and the side effects are mildly annoying. This time however, I have been feeling extremely tired and light headed. If I make any sudden movements I feel like I might pass out. I am also sleeping a lot which may be because I barely slept for a week when I was flaring. I've never experienced this before and am not sure what is causing it.
