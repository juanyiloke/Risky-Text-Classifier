ÊWhat is paranoia?I would like to know the definition of paranoia and if it is what I am experiencing. I am overcoming a depression phase and manic phase or you can call it a mixed ep as my dose just got increased.So basically I experience (on and off) when I am at work this sense that my colleagues dislike me. They dislike me for having this condition and always going on about how miserable my life is. I did this when I got really depressed. I feel like a bloody burden and they don't like me working with them. I don't feel they mean any harm to me. I really like them but can't see why they like me. and I know I am being irrational but I cannot shake the thoughts when I get them. Is that paranoia? Also the way they talk to me, the tone of their voice, perhaps they are having a bad day but I take it personally.
