Check your 2012/13 Tax Coding NoticeIf you will be 65 in the current tax year its worth checking your coding notice. I will be 65 In November and have not automatically been given the age related increase in the allowance (still available in 2012/13 for those will an income of less than £30190). The onus is apparently on me to ring the Revenue to get their records changed.
