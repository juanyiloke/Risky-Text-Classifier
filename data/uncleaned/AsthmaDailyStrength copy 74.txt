My doctor's respond by saying "no that's not causing it" or "that's strange" When I get an infection (upper respiratory) they want to give me Z-Pack, and it doesn't work for me ever anymore. But they do it anyway so, then I get another round of a different antibiotic. I am either usually healed or have to do one more round. Sometimes its on and off with the rounds until the infection is gone. Then I get a secondary infection (ladies - the yeast infection) almost like clockwork. I get either a yeast infection or a skin infection. Or both after each other. Every. Single. Time. I take probiotics which sometimes helps. But no doctor has given me any way to prevent this cycle or what to do to prevent the first infection, or what to do to prevent the second infection. I have tried drinking Olympic amounts of water, avoiding sugar and the inevitable always happens. I am scheduled to see an alternative medicine healer soon because MD's just don't want to do preventive medicine. Anyone else have this cycle? Also, I am convinced my asthma meds are the cause of my anxiety disorder. It is right on the side effects, but still my pulmonologist and a few GP's have waived it off as not possible. Anyone have any suggestions for prevention that works for them??
