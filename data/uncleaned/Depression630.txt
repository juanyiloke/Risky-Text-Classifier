What people don't seeStarted by Paula?, 06-04-15 09:39 PMA friend of mine posted this on fb for me as it's very relevant given I suffer chronic pain. However, looking at it, most, if not all of the points made relate to my management of my mental health too. We all fight with all we have, yet often look like we're floating on water. Perhaps our loved ones need to be shown that, just because we look ok, doesn't mean we are ok. And maybe we need to realise that, sometimes, our loved ones have no idea how bad we feel - we're doing too good a job of hiding it
