What you as a woman like in women.I thought this might be interesting. I know there is a thread about what we like in men but what do we like in other women.I myself am Lesbian, so maybe I have a bit more to like about women than some of you, but whatever you like about other women is welcome in this thread.Growing up, women or other girls have been my main confidants and my main support.ÊI loved the way the girls I grew up with not only wanted to do things but to talk intimately sometimes in groups but especially on a one to one and a best friend was a thing to treasure.I liked the way my girl friends could often sense when something was wrong or when something was right even before telling them and that we were interested in one anothers lives.ÊAdult women told me how they coped with life, encouraged and supported me to be able to have a better life than they did. There was great humour and a sense of camaraderie among the older women I knew. I was educated by women when free secondary education came in and one of the nuns gave up her friday evenings for several months, for free, to prepare me for college, no one in my family had made it past primary school untill then.Now as an adult I still share my inner life with other women and I am still supported by women who understand empathise and tell me how they handle various life crisis and achievements as well as simply what they make of it all.I love the softness of women, the strength of women, the beauty, the vulnerability, wisdom, laughter and shared understanding of women.How about you?
