Life should be great but why do i keep falling into despair?   james123456Life should be great for me. Im a 30 yr old male. Im not bad looking. I have a decent and rewarding but extremely stressful job. I have a loving family. I have great friends. I am trim and look after myself. I have invested in the property market and am doing well for myself financially. I even ride around in a classic car.This is really hard to explain but i will try in the hope that someone can offer some support/guidance. I seem to have everything going for me, a lot of the time i am happy enough. For several month periods, maybe 2-3 per year, i fall into deep despair. I have such a low mood. Even the basics in life become verydifficult. I have done the online tests and it suggests that i have severe depression. I cannot talk to family/friends. I will not see a Doctor. sometimes i feel so alone, its a real struggle. I get anxious about the future. I cant seem to meet a woman. I cant settle. I am a workaholic and this keeps me sane, but im exhausted. I feel like i will 'lose it' at times, ie control of everything. I am hoping someone can help me with this. I feel so low at present.
