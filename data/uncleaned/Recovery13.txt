Fake It Till You Make It?Has anybody seriously tried this?OK.  Depression sucks.  Nothing's fun anymore.  Nobody likes me.  Work's a drag that I simply don't want to do anymore.  I ain't got nobody.Just curious... has anybody given an honest effort to portraying the person you want to be?To waking up, going through the hygiene motions, then arriving at work with a smile on your face, and devoting all day to simply working?To excelling at your craft, and relishing in the fact?Maybe taking a refreshing walk at lunchtime?EMailing an old friend and asking for a lunch date?Watching the sunset with your headphones on?Theory is that you can start to become by emulating.  That at some point you recognize the traits that more successful people have - that you begin to understand more positive reactions to stimuli.Again, just curious.
