The only reason Im still alive after an 9 year battle with depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts is because I don't want to put my loved ones through my loss.ÊUnlike a lot of people with depression, I don't feel alone, I have the most amazig family/friends but my depression is the monster inside. I feel helpless, overwhelmed, scared, and I don't know what to do.I guess I wish someone would tell me its ok to die so I can pass away without guilt.ÊA life lived to please everyone else isn't worth it anymore.I've been planning it out for some time but still go back and forth with these issues, how to make it easier on my loved ones, how to do it as painlessly as possible, how to say goodbye, make sure my cat is taken care of once Im gone, who will find my body....these are the biggest obticles with my decision.
