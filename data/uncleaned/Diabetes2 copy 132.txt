Symptoms of diabetes or Over active thyroid?Hi, in 2010 I had overactive thyroid, had it treated with medication, after a few years I was taken off it.  Over the last few months I've been sick with Neurlgia, , kidney infections and what I would call a lot of messing with different medication (prescribed by GP).  Then on Xmas day a passing comment about my thyroid being overactive again made me see a GP.  She said yes it is but Consultant says my bloods are fine.  So a "forum friend" suggested I ask on here what you might think.  Symptomsweight loss but eating he same:palms of my hands very red (out part of palms)sweaty handsice cold feetCold but hate heatgritty eyes and lagging eyelidshaky handsanxious aches in arms and legs etc.,im not thirsty nor am I going to the loo any more often fast heart beat (not all the time)and of course "worry" how can I not when people don't agree on what is going on with me, I have tried to get to see Consultant in person but unable to do either going public or private, first appointment 23rd Feb, so in no mans land until then.thanks u in advance for your thoughts. J.
