  Fairly new to Asthma________________________________________Hello all,I am a 49 year old woman who was told that I have asthma only in the last 2 years. The first time was after having bronchitis. Prior to that I have always been a healthy person with the exception of having acid reflux. In early December I had what seemed to be a mild cold or flu. low temp for a day or so a little congestion then I seemed to be recovered. then suddenly after walking a few city blocks I noticed I was really short of breath and chest felt tight so I used my rescue inhaler which helped. This happened a few times so I went to my regular GP and he changed the advair I was on to Spiriva and said to use rescue inhaler when I needed to. At that time i could hardly talk without losing my breath. Had in episode a few days later where the alburetol did not work and I went to the ER. I used nebulizer treatment and it helped. I then started to use nebulizer at home. After not much relief the dr called in a script for prednisone to start with 60 a few days then taper down. During this time I found a pulmonologist that what take me soon and not make me wait till March. He did lung function tests and believe that I am having a bad flareup due to untreated asthma because after the treatment I had my readings improved. I started prednisone on 1/14/2015 and I am still having difficulty. Did blood work for allergies and sarcoidosis (my mom had it) and we are awaiting the results. I was thinking I may have a nut allergy based on what I had eaten on the days that I felt the worst.I am wondering If others have flareups that last this long. I still get short of breath when I talk after being on the meds over a week. Sometimes I feel that the diagnosis is wrong. Also if others get really exhausted from this. I can barely function to do normal tasks. I dont really have any other issues except shortness of breath and stuffy head at times. Pulmonologist changed my daily inhaler to Breo eliptor (does anyone else use this drug?) and added OTC allergy meds. II decided to post this to see if what is happening to me is the norm for asthma patients. I dont know anyone personally who suffers with it. Thanks in advance for your responses. I wish all a happy and healthy day.
