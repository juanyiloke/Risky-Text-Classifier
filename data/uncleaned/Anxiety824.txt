Can Anxiety affect only one side of body?!Hi guys!Hi, I am 29 and fighting with weird symptoms, 2 months ago i experienced panick attack.Ênext day i noticed that my left leg and arm feel bit weird, like weak, tingling or warm, its difficult to discribe, on and off and than I would get very achy muscles, like i did a work out for that one muscle and than chest pain fallowed. so next day i went to ER, thinking there is something with my heart or i have mini stroke. Doctor run quick ECG, checked my temperature and did a physical test on my arm and leg. he told me it was anxiety, nothing more. Since than I experienced chest pain(thinking heart problems), IBS (thinking is colon cancer), stomach palpitations (thinking is abdominal aortic aneurysm)ÊI had a 3 EKG since than, had complete blood work, a stress test(on treadmill). Everything come back good (apart from my vitamin d, its very low) I went to my doctor at least 4 times, I also went to ER twice in past two months. every doctor told me it is a panic attack or anxiety. I noticed that I freak out alot wiyh all the symtoms I had and I also worry alot. Now I got new one! my left side got bit worse last saturday, since than i feel weak and get dizzy spells for like 3 hours mid day every day. So I went to my doctor again and explained the whole thing and he is refering me for a TIA Assessment (mini stroke) I am so freaked out, I just want my life back,feel so miserable. Is there anyone with such symptoms?
