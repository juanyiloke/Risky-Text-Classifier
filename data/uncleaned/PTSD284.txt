PTSD?by liam224 » Wed Apr 23, 2014 10:48 amWondering if I have/had PTSD.Last year I was roommates with an individual who was severely mentally disturbed. He had serious anger issues, mainly focused around his computer. He would scream at his computer all the time over just about any problem. Died in a video game, slow internet connection, computer crashed, whatever. It was loud and extremely vulgar - one thing he yelled frequently was "stop shitting on me". He would get up and pace around the room frequently, making me feel like I could not leave my back to him. Towards the end it got worse and he was even verbally abusive a couple times.It seriously affected my sleep. He would go to bed at 1am or 2am, and so I stayed up until 5am because I could get some peace and quiet. I think this is still affecting my sleep schedule because I have difficulty going to sleep at a regular time. Sometimes I sleep at night, sometimes during the day. It changes by at least a few hours every day.I'm in a single room this year so I don't have any roommate issues anymore. But when I was coming back I literally had bad dreams the first couple days in which he was back at school. I've always been comfortable being alone but it's to new extremes now. I spend entire days in my room with the door closed, leaving only for meals.Would any of this qualify as PTSD? Is there any way to normalize? I've never been comfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist because I have that mental health stigma
