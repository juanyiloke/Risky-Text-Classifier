RelationshipsStarted by Furbs?, 03-04-15 11:39 PMJust asking people's advice really. If or when you were to start a new relationship at what point in it would you first tell them you had depression/mental health problems?Would you be up front from the start or wait for a while? My last relationship of 3 years ended 12 months ago when my boyfriend refused to listen to me talk about feeling down (he didn't believe in depression) and then finished me after a suicide attempt which has made me wary of disclosing it to the next guy I might meet. But then some days I think it's easier to be single then I wouldn't have to put someone through the same crap I have to go through every day in my mind.Any thoughts would be most welcome
