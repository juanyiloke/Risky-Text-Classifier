I was about 10 when i first wanted to kill myself, I had just been molested by my step father for the I-don't-knownth time and my abusive mother dragged me by the hair around the house for not finishing my chores on time. I had stopped believing in god because I could accept that there was a god out there that would let this happen to a child. the beatings began when I was 6 and younger, I was so scared, I knew I did nothing wrong. and when I was 8 I began a "relationship" with my moms roommate tony. I look back on everything he did and feel so sick, it stopped when he moved out and my stepdad moved in. he was so nice to me, and when he was around my mom didn't hit me as much, but I became his "girlfriend" too.Êthat night he asked for a picture of me. I felt so dirty. I wanted to scream and cry, to tell someone . but I had no one. so I decided to kill myself. I grabbed some sleeping pills about 12 I think. and I took them one by one, I felt this sense of piece loom over me, it was done. but I woke up the next day, I saw that I threw the pills up, in my sleep. I thought I was so ****** up I couldn't even do this right. fast forward 8 years and here I am again contemplating killing myself. but I have kids now two girls so I cant but I don't want to live, the love of my life walked out of my life and my babbydaddy is a jerk I just want to be happy but the only time is when I get to be with my girls, but im so sad , I want to cry every second , I think of how I might do it to make it look like an accident , like I fell from the flight of steps, so they wont hate me. im so weak, I don't have much strength left. everything hurts. I just want it to be over. but I cant since im a mom so im stuck here suffering
