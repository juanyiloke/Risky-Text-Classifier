all my life, i have had on going conversations with people in my head! i also hear people i know slagging me off, and it really annoys me and often causes panic attacks, as it is their voice i can hear and saying things about me and i can also just imagine them all saying these things as iv heard it! i dont know what to do, i get so angry with people becaude it sounds so real as if i have just heard them talking about me from miles away! does any1 else suffer from this??????
