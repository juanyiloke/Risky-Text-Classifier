Exercise Bulimia - updated.Hey guys,ÊI need a little support as im struggling alot right now. Im not in any treatment atm as I was discharged last summer & my doctor has messed my new referral up twice (im waiting to go out of area - so need to apply for funding etc).Ive been a healthy weight for about 8 months now & this is the heaviest I have ever been in my life.Im struggling with extreme low body image issues, im constantly needing reassurance that I look okay or that im not ballooning up as the day goes on. I binge and purge regularly to right now.I actually eat extremely well when im not binging. My calorie intake is high and my foods are all healthy & clean.Im very into fitness & I get upset/anxious and distressed when I can not work out or I eat something "bad". Im exercising even when my body is begging me to stop because its sore & tired but my mind wont allow me to. Ive gone from suffering from Anorexia so therefore constantly needed to lose weight to needing to have a "perfect & fit" body.Im just never good enough & its bringing me down.I just feel extreme guilt when i cant work out to the point it ruins my day or I hurt myself.I dont know what to do or who to talk to. As a result of my guilt im BPing more and more & I now feel im lost in a vicious cycle between them both.Any advice??Update - today I snapped the ligaments in my neck from over exercise. I know it should be a(nother) wake up call & I've been told I can't exercise for atleast 6 weeks...I can not cope with that. I'm really struggling
