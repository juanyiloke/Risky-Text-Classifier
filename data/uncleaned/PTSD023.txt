Kids Back To Bad SituationMy ex has a couple of foster kids. She's had them for a couple of years. I help out with them a lot and have gotten close. One is three and one is seven.ÊYesterday the judge decided they will probably go back to the Dad. I'm so frustrated. The system sucks. When she first got them the little one couldn't hold his head up and he was undernourished. Mom was a Heroin addict. The little one had stayed in his car seat all day everyday. After about a year Mom got in a program and got pregnant. They went back to her but when the therapist for the little one came she wouldn't open the door and the older one was missing school. She had the baby but she managed to overdose the kid on Tylenol and Benadryl.ÊSo back to my ex they came. Mom was convicted of involuntary manslaughter but given probation. The oldest one blossomed in school and the little one who it was discovered had fetal alcohol syndrome was excelling in a therapy program.ÊMom can't live with them but Dad who doesn't speak english said he would take them. He is taking parenting courses with an interpreter at his house. They are suppose to go back in August. Mom is still living with Dad but is suppose to move out. (Yea right like that is going to happen.) The kids don't speak spanish so they will be lost. I guess they will learn real fast.ÊIt just makes me sick to my stomach.
