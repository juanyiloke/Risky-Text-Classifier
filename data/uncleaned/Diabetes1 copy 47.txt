Has everybody got diabetes.Or is this just the dream of the drug companies? Everybody has BG levels that bounce up and down. My wife eats some shocking stuff and her BG goes up. But I do admit her pancreas gets hold of the situation a lot faster than mine. Is that the true meaning of diabetes? A speedy and thuggish pancreas..This whole thing puzzles me. Seventeen months ago my so-called GP said she thought I had diabetes. This was based on a blood test result which was almost identical with seven previous results over 4 and a half years that had not interested her at all.It was World Diabetes Week or something that week so maybe she had read a leaflet on diabetes and vaguely recalled her training or she wanted as many new diabetics as possible to enter a raffle for a new car.She tried to put me on Eucreas (Icandra) (which is pretty powerful) at one per day. The website says two a day. She said nothing about monthly liver and kidney function tests. Then she said come back and see me in a year.I had a forceful meeting with her and told her to stick her tablets as I planned to deal with it by diet and exercise.Seventeen months on I have lost 3.5 stone and my morning BG readings are between 5.6 and 6.7. Three hours after evening meal they are usually between 6.7 and 7.6. Very rarely they go to 8. On two nights they were 8.8 and 8.9 --both the result of going to an Indian restaurant.The highest my A1c has been in 4.5 years was 7.4.I don't think I have diabetes. I don't think I ever had diabetes. BUT, does the simple fact that a sloppy careless GP once said I did have diabetes, mean I am saddled with that for life?It's like I tell people I do not have high blood pressure. Because I don't. The tablets keep it down. Obvious.What does the person who has got to the end of this spiel think? Please..
