linkedin??2011-10-20, 10:32 AMHow many of you are on it? If you are, do you use it only to connect with current/past co-workers? Job finding? Joining groups? just curious what most people use this site for.I just registered and have a ton of linkedin requests from people I dont know, but are in my same industry. Since my personal email is listed, I dont want to connect with them.any thoughts? Thanks!Being strong is a beautiful thing to be!
