Hi allI'm really keen to get a Snuzpod. I am also really keen to get a movement monitor like Angelcare but I have read conflicting info about whether the two are compatible due to the solid base needed and space for wires. Has anyone used both together?ÊAlso I just saw a RespiSense monitor which you clip to the nappy - does anyone have any experience of this? Or is this monitoring experience too far!I think I am 9dpo but I have heavy boobs and feel dizzy. Test says negative but I know it's too early. I am 39 and have 2.5 old ds. I had unplanned pregnacy last year and had mc. This is again unplanned as we hasn't made up our mind yet but now I think I am and not sure I want to be. What are the chances of mc at my age (not that I would want this). DS has been nightmare today and not sure I can cope going through it all again with a toddler.I need reassurance please.
