I can't die yet.....If I committed suicide right now, my sister would flip -- were like twins, my suicide would kill her. Also I have a cat now. My sister's friend gave her a cat, and it turns out the cat likes me better then my sister. I didn't want it at first, but the cat forced it's way on me, now it sits with me every night and watches tv with me. Sometimes I want to die so bad, but it's not to be, not now. I don't know when death will come, but it can't be by suicide, my uncle committed suicide, and that's enough for my family.
