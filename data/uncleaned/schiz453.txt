Êmissing that part of meAbout a year ago i was diagnosed with schizophrenia at my lowest it was really bad and these last few month i've been getting better. I am glad that I'm better but part of me misses the madness in my head and the voices. when you grow up perceiving that what your experiancing is "normal" and i just figured its who i am but now that that part of me is pretty much gone i feel different like sanity was forced upon me so i can be part of society. I guess madness can be a good excuse to get away from reality.
