advise on gaining weightHi, i havn't posted in a while but i could really do with some advise. i've been following a mealplan for a while but it took me quite some time to acctually follow it to the letter and not skip few things. After a week or so i can see some results and i gained a bit of weight which is great. I know i should continue as it's clearly working but since yesterday when i saw the number on the scale, i can't relax. I'm a but scared, i ate today but not 100% according to the plan and i can see how i'm justifying some bad behaviours. I want to continue gaining weight but dont know how to relax more and accept that it is ok my body will expand.... any advise? Thanks
