TerrifiedHi guys I'm sorry to post again I'm such a fat worthless monster. I hate myself I had a really difficult session with my eating disorders nurse I was just so at a loss for words and what I did say was in anger and it made no sense . I feel so guilty and disgusted with myself and it might be my last session as I am going back to step up and they said a place might be available quickly . She has done so much for me and I didn want our ending to be full of frustration. I. Still feel too fat and worthless too.
