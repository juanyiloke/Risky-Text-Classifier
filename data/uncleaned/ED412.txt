ÊChanging habitsI'm confused. Not sure if I have a problem or not. I used to be bulimic for about 10 years but have been fine for about 12 years. Since about Christmas time I have been feeling really down about my weight and started a diet. It started out very healthy - I followed weight watchers but just online - no meetings. Anyway before long I started getting really obsessed again. I weigh myself a dozen times a day. I eat only safe foods and panic when there is a danger i can't. I think about food and weight 24/7 and feel fat and disgusting. I have lost weight and am in the healthy weight range although nearer the top end. I think things will be okay when I reach my target weight but am I kidding myself? I have also started to make every meal that bit more healthy so I now no longer eat all my days points - usually eat between 18 and 23 when you are meant to have between 29 and 36. It still seems enough but would this be classed as restricting? I started to see a counselor and have been twice. He have be relaxation exercises but every time I try them I am meant to focus on different body parts to relax but all I focus on is how big those body parts are. I texted him to say this and he has told me to stop until I see him next. Feel such a failure. I see my GP tomorrow morning as at my last appointment which was about migraines I mentioned this very briefly. He asked me to come back to discuss it further. Really nervous and don't know what to expect. What if he wants to weigh me. I am so heavy. This is so draining.
