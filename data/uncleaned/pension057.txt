Vicious CircleOur local authority is using offenders serving community service to do minor maintenance in the local parks e.g. painting railings, relaying paths etc. This has enabled the local authority to cancel a contract with a local company who used to do the work and has now been forced to close down and lay off all its employees who are now, presumably, claiming unemployment benefit. It’s a strange world isn’t it?
