Unacceptable behaviour at annual reviewJust back from the annual review and I am fuming. Was looking forward to getting some praise for once because the results of my HbA1c according to my GP was perfect and showed that the way ahead could perhaps be a little better. However, it seems that the whole appointment was used to criticise my weight. When asked if I had any concerns or ailments, I was berated for being overweight and that any and all ailments were because I was fat. In fact I was being referred for bariatric weight loss surgery !....I never asked nor do I want weight loss surgery. When explaining that I had mental health issues, acute depression, PTSD with anxiety and panic attacks and that I am not always able to deal with issues even if they are as acute as diabetes and the constant anxiety of injections etc. But she dismissed this with ''unless you are in a coma or someone has a power of attorney over you, then you are still able to make your own decisions about what you eat or do not eat'. So after this appointment I have no more idea about my diabetes and how it relates to me, no encouragement and now have a referral for bariatric operation that I didn't ask for nor will entertain.
