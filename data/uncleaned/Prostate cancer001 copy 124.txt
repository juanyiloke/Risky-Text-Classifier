The Myth of the common law wife In the UK (tho not sure about Scotland) there is no such thing as a common law wife,despite what many people believe.   So your partner will not inherit your estate ,property and pension rights.   The answer ,gents, is marry her or make a will in her favour.  I apologize in advance as I do not wish to offend anyone but there is no good time to post this.  Please think about this ,thanks.  We are married and this has brought me some peace of mind during DH's treatment.
