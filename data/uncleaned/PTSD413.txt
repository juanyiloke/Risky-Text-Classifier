ÊMy life (possible triggers)Hello everyone, I have been reading about your experiences for a short while and want to share mine, I have tried a couple of times but triggered and had to stop, one of my exercises my therapist has suggested is writing down the trauma, so maybe this will help me, I will try and keep it brief and I apologise if I trigger you in the process.From the age of 5, I was physically, emotionally and sexually abused by my stepdad, I won't expand on the latter but the physical and emotional abuse was daily, if I did the slightest thing wrong or sometimes even if I didn't, I received vicious beatings, I was punched, kicked, hit with belts, (the belt was used mostly if I was late from school or when he was drunk, and was also used as a teaching aid when he taught me how to tie my shoelaces) I was also made to sit for hours in total darkness in the under stairs cupboard, told I was useless and a piece of **** etc, I learnt to swim by being thrown into a lake off a jetty, and after I went under three times he would jump in and "rescue" me. I also had to watch powerless as my mum suffered the same violence, and later on in life my brothers, my mother tried on several occasions to leave him and we went in and out of women's refuges throughout my childhood, unfortunately she went back to him every time.I obviously left home at the earliest opportunity and started drinking and taking drugs almost immediately, for many many years I had panic attacks, was scared senseless if I heard raised voices, I had awful flashbacks, extreme bouts of dissociation, and suffered with depression, though I didn't know what they were at the time, I managed to get a job as an apprentice structural engineer, but failed my weekly college course twice due to my inability to concentrate, remember formulae or focus in general (and the students union bar opened at lunchtime!!)Years later I have managed to block the majority of my childhood memories and I have been able to get on with my life best as I can, I have two beautiful children, I have managed to secure a career as an engineer on the railway, I slowed my drinking down to social levels and stopped taking drugs, that is until last year, I was involved in a high speed accident on the motorway, in short my van was hit by another vehicle at about 80 mph, it hit the kerb and rolled over several times, sliding on its roof for a while, at which point I pulled my head towards the steering wheel because I thought it was going to be dragged along the Tarmac before coming to rest back on its wheels.From this point on, my world has imploded, the sensation of being totally powerless is back with a vengeance and is one of the causes of my almost daily panic attacks, I have flashbacks that are so vivid, mainly of sliding along the hard shoulder with my head jammed against the steering wheel, with an overwhelming belief that I am going to die, I have started dissociating again, (I think I have been doing this the whole time and just didn't recognise it until my therapist witnessed me doing it) I can't sleep because of nightmares about the accident, and now childhood memories are returning too, I am currently off work due to driving anxiety and depression.I thought I had beaten the heebie jeebies as I used to call them, but now I am right back in the middle of them.Isn't life a *****!!!
