Please, I would SO appreciate your opinionI honestly don't know if I fit better into the Anxiety or the Depression Group... because I feel in between. It usually starts as soon as I wake up in the mornings and feel MORBID... not so 'down and sad'...as a sort of fearful, horrid morbidity, dark and gray like...like I am trapped away from getting to a place where I could feel 'normal'...I am allergic to SSRI's and only take .5 Ativan at night with a half Unisom in order to sleep.I am not worried about things and just don't know what has brought this on. It sometimes gets better in late afternoons and evenings.I still force myself to go through my morning routine (am retired) and usually got out for coffee. I have no idea what its like to wake up rested and refreshed. I could deal with the tiredness if only the Other would not happen. Can ANYBODY relate or have any kind of opinion or advice.. .I would so appreciate hearing from you.
