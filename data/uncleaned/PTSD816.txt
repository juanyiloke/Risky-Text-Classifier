ÊThey Hit The Post Office Today .....Bastards! Armed f**king robbery! And this against two girls, sitting there, across an open counter! FFS!This is two street, deeply rural Eire, FFS. Ye could reach over and touch those girls! None of this bullet proof glass and little trays shit. No talking through grills. They're just f**king sitting there. You know their names and they know yours.And now some f**king bastards have burst in there, screaming and shouting. Waving guns around. Terrorised them and made off with who gives a shit what.That was about half nine this morning. By four? They had them back in there, doling out the cash. Because it's xmass bonus day for the welfare claimants, or some such f**king thing.ÊWhat ever. An Post couldn't muster a pair of stand ins. They put them right back there to carry on.And I'm hearing; " Ah, Ann's a good, solid, farmers daughter! She'll be fine! " Oh, really?!? Well, I was hardly a shrinking f**king violet myself, ye know. But, looking down into those two, deadly black eyes, thinking, " My head's about to be blown into a red mist here! " I don't give a f**k Who ye father was!Christ, I'm wound up!Ê
