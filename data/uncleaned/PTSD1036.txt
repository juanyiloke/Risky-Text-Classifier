I have PTSD and being responsible I have been open to therapies such as medication, EMDR, CBT and psychotherapy, usually a combination. Apart from learning coping mechanisms and about yourself as well as avoiding retraumatization, do you believe there is a cure for PTSD? Having had anxiety since a child and being officially diagnosed with PTSD a year and a half ago, it has been a struggle but things have slowly improved. Now there is a group therapist suggesting that with "Trauma" therapy, all of my trauma will be removed and I will be cured of PTSD. I have not been overly impressed with this therapist and find their approach to be simplistic. I'd like to ask, plain and simple, from PTSD sufferers: Do you believe there is a cure to PTSD and/or trauma? Thank you!
