HeyMy name is T and im 17, ive always fucking hated living. If its not one thing its the other, my family is terrible. when i was 13 my father died from a accident. i saw him dead. and my mother got married to my shit head of a step dad 4 months later. (who goes out of town for weeks at a time.) you know what the first thing the only father figure in my life tells me when i dont see him for 3 weeks? he calls me a lazy pot head. yes, i have a drug addiction but only because im so fucking depressed, ive been experimenting with drugs. i cant do anything right. my mom constantly tells me to go fuck myself and she hates me, also that my depression isnt real and its all just a act. i just dont know what to do. im not killing myself today or anything.. im ugly, my bestfriend has also tried to kill himself and he would have if i didnt drive to his house at 3 am in the morning and struggle with him. how the fuck do people live with this? ive realized ill never make anything of myself. im worthless, i just want to kill myself. please help me.
