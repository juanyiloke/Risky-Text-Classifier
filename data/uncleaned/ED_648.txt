Diabetes and EDI feel a bit uncomfortable posting this because I used to be anorexic and now I'm quite overweight. I guess I feel like a a fraud. Anyway, I wanted to know if there were any people here who struggle with EDs and have diabetes.ÊI'm finding it really hard because I still have urges to restrict and miss meals, but if I do I get hypos which are really unpleasant and quite dangerous. I hate being the size I am but it's feeding into my ED (no pun intended) because restriction is no longer an option and that freaks me out. If anyone has any advice or experiences that would be great.
