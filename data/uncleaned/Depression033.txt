ever deepening depression , yet can feel so good . i have been on venlaxafine for many years now and my gp put me on quetiapine about 3 months ago , slowly my dose has been increased from 25mg to 150mg and as it has gone up my depression has deepened , i have never felt so low fed up sad emotional , i feel like a stranger in my own world , nothing means anything to me i feel void of emoions love care , i wake up , force myself to go to work to talk to people even my family wife and children , then out of the blue i will feel normal , Êi will smile , maybe laugh and every thing seems so much better , then it could be minutes or hours i go back to the most horrendous low mood , wanting to cry be left alone ,with the overwelming thoughts of what is the point of life , does any body think its the meds making me feel like this as i nhave never had feelings like this before had bad anxiety but never such bad depression , i have a good job no money worries i am healthy , i have never smoked and dont drink and have a lovly caring family so why do i feel so lowVENALAXAFINE TO CITOLAPRAM JUMP i have been on venalaxafine for many years horrible side effects been to the doctors today as my depression and anxiety have got much worse , i also take 150mg of quetiapine which is not doing anything at all , my doctor has told me to take 75mg of venalaxafine tomorrow then 37.5 the next day then start tacking 10mg of citolapram and just stop the venalaxafine as citolapram will work the same as the venalaxafine , its making me rather axious and worried just stopping the venalaxafine in 2 days has any one else had this change over , i have cut out venalaxafine in a week and the withdrawels were horrendous ,
