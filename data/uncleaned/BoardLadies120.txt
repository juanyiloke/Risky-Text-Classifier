Travelling as a solo femaleI'm a typical thirty-something female who enjoys seeing the world. However, as a single women and with conflicting schedules it can often be difficult to arrange holidays with friends and families. As I enjoy my own company and like doing my own thing I have no problem going on holidays by myself.ÊOver the last two years I have visited Italy, Spain and Belgium all on my lonesome. I thoroughly enjoyed all trips except for one aspect; the constant, relentless street harassment you get as a solo female.ÊOn a recent trip to Southern Italy the harassment was so bad I actually felt complete and utter relief on returning to my hotel room. There's only so many times you can politely ignore or reject someone, and being stared at and followed is downright intimidating! I was I was speaking to a male friend of mine who had returned from Southern Italy just a couple of weeks before me, and it hadn't been an issue for him at all. It made me think that the often intimidating levels of attention women receive when travelling alone is something that men travelling by themselves don't even have to think about or contend with.ÊAnyone else travel solo and experienced similar?
