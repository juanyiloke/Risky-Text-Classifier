 Jobs in Agriculture for Vets2014-03-31, 06:52 AMOne sector of the economy with good paying jobs that are begging to be filled now are in Agribusiness.Farming is moving past the old image of the Family Farm to a new WIFI Farm with computerization and many of the technologies of the battle field now being applied to growing crops. Including the use of Drones that map the acres for typography, infra red imaging, and other data collection to monitor thegrowing process, harvesting process etc. There is also the monitoring of markets, inventories of farm supplies and field progress with work teams.Recently a new bill was passed to get returning soldiers retrained for these new Agritech jobs:Today's 3/31/2014 AgDay report Showcases a Drone being used in Farming. The new company "Ag-Eagle" now has dronespriced at $12,000 to $200,000 depending on the equipment. Their sales of equipment is growing rapidly now as the technologyproves itself. (there is a link to watch each AgDay report in the RSS page of my Home Page for those who want to follow future developments for Vets being retrained for Agribusiness)AgEagle story and podcast:[url]http://agwired.com/2013/07/29/ageagle-tractor-tuff-robotic-aircraft/[/url]If you know a Vet who has interest in Agriculture, thank him for his service when he returns by telling him about this opportunity.
