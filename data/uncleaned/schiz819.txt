18.Afraid of everyone including family members. I feel like everyone person is out to get me and harm me. I like to keep a distance from all people. Lets say a family member is walking behind or getting near me. I will run up stairs, run into a room and lock the door. When someone looks me in my eyes I start to tear up. This started when I was 14. I'm in my room everyday and in my mind I pretend on someone i'm not. Say a celebrity or an important person. I pretend that i'm a celebrety,doctor,scientist or a war veteren returning home to his loved ones.Usually a different person everyday, and I believe im this person. Sometimes I forget what i'm thinking isn't real. I feel like i'm being watched when I sleep sometimes. I believe that someone is listening to my conversations in my mind. Like when i'm thinking something, I believe that someonem somwhere is listening to what I think. Like i'm not alone. In my mind I believe a girl I never met before is in loved and is in love with me, even though she doesn't know i'm around. I occasionally hear voices, though not everyday. This next part is going to sound really messed up. But when I hear of cases cases of Domestic abuse, or murder I find it funny and laugh. I find not approriate things funny. But when I hear of positive things I tear up. There is more than this to but this is difficult to type and is making me sad. I'm afriaid to tell anyone becuase I don't think that they would understand what i'm going through. I know that there is something wrong with me but don't know what it is. I know i'm all over the place, and I know this is allot of random information.I'm sorry if i'm posting this in the wrong section.
