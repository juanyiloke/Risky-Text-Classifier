I am 28 with an 8 year old daughter, who talks to me like rubbish..I work part time so I get to pick her up from school every day but leave for work very early so 2 nights she stays at her grandparent's, and 2 mornings she goes to a Childminder at 7 o'clock. She also has to stay at her dad's every Friday night till Saturday afternoon. with her dad she just goes to above mentioned grandparents, I try to do fun stuff with her, aswell as drama class, parties, holidays but she just wants to go dad's and grandparents. She tells me I do nothing for her and they really care. We are all decent and don't say anything bad about each other infront of her. She says she doesn't talk to anyone else this way because she would get into trouble but im not a push over with her. I just don't know what to do, is she staying away too much with too many adult figures Involved? any advice or tips would be helpful, I feel it's ground hog day every day.
