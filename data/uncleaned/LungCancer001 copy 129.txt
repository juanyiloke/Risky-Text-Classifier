I got my results and I beg for your forgiveness...Well, I got my results and I do not have lung cancer. I do have to have a hysterectomy for my blood disorder but I don't have cancer. Now for the forgiveness part. When I got home and everything settled in, I thought about you all and I just broke down into tearts. I feel so horrible for coming to you with my anxiousness, and worrying you about my fears. I feel so ashamed for bothering you all when all I had to do was wait. But I swear, I didn't mean any harm...I was just anxious and scared you know? So, I beg each and every one of you as I cry these tears tyoing this, please, I beg you...please forgive me. I'm sorry. Thank you for reading my post and thank you especially for those who responded. Your compassion and loving kindness got me through this and to you, I will be forever grateful. I will think of you all and check on you and fight for your cause daily! I love you sincerely...and...thank you...May God of your understanding continue to watch over you and keep you in his loving care...until we meet again...
