Off to see horrible GP, wish me luck¥	I am biting the bullet today and going to see my horrible, supercilious GP about changing the brand of anastrozole I am on.  We have had a lot of discussion here recently about the different brands and the side effects everyone experiences, so I am going to go in armed with all that information - thank you so much everyone for that, especially Dreamthief!  I have been keeping an eye on my hot flushes, which have got better recently, but the pharmacy changed the brand of my drug the last prescription I got, and the hot flushes have got worse with a vengeance.  This seems Significant to me.  ¥	My GP likes to ask what you think about what's wrong with you, and then very patronisingly and patiently explain why it is that you are deluded and mistaken and that it is all in your mind.  I am going to be going in with a lock of the famous Alfie Purl's fleece in my pocket for good luck and a steely attitude.  What a contrast to my treatment at the hospital, where my consultant greets me like a friend and a member of the team fighting my cancer.  My appointment is 4.10pm...
