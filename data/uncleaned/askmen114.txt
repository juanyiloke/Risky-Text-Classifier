Appropriate or not.2012-06-01, 03:00 AMI'm trying to get a 2nd interview with a great company. Had an initial screening interview (over the phone) with some who would be my peer and that went great, had a face to face interview with the VP a couple days later and that went well.My initial contact emailed me to say she still hasn't heard from the VP on next steps, it's been a week. My problem is another company wants an answer to a job offer by early next week and I can't stall them for long.How can I tactfully push the first company forward without being too push/obnoxious?Thank you!
