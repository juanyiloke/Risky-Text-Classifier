Pleasure or Pain?Hello people,I'll try and be brief:I want to be a productive person. I'm in my final year at university and it's been very difficult. I'm certainly bright enough, since I can produce first class work. Yet, I have a big procrastination problem.I'm forever wanting to pursue pleasure. Whether it's YouTube, news websites, rock climbing, music etc. If I'm not doing something like that, then I feel I'm missing out on pleasure. This trigger anxiety.I want to know how to overcome this? How can I be busy Monday to Friday? I like my weekends off, but most times I feel the weekday feels like a weekend most times.What concepts can I research? What academic studies are there? What about your personal experience? Can you relate?Thanks.Lee.
