ÊReally struggling to eatI don't really know why the switch flipped for me. I feel I am overweight and usually when I am stressed I over eat, but now, after quitting my job, getting accepted into uni, moving back to where I grew up, moving into a new apartment, and starting therapy, all of a sudden I can't eat. I have plenty of healthy food in the fridge that is going to waste, but I am not hungry. Even when I get a few twinges of hunger, I can't face the thought of eating. I look in the fridge and am overwhelmed by the choices that I have. I don't know why I go to extremes, and why I can't just find a healthy balance.
