Êcoping with binge/emotional eating?Alright, so I am aware that this may be a pretty vague topic... and I don't know if binge eating stems from one or many things, whether that be mental illness or general coping skills. But having had problems with bingeing or emotional eating for probably a good 5+ years, I don't understand how one can refrain from this bad habit, without adding onto another bad habit/coping mechanism.Has anyone who has dealt with, or is recovering from this able to elaborate on different (POSITIVE) skills, habits, distractions, or whatever else that has helped them avoid or recover from such disordered eating patterns and instability?much love,ÊSmiley.Ê
