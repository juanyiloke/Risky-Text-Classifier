ÊTrying to be strong as life takes its punchesTo be honest i sometimes see no point in life. The only time i do truly see the point in life is when i'm with my family having a good time or seeing people enjoy themselves and of course when i feel everything in my life is in place. Other than that .....whats the point ? I feel i as if i dont belong because life is all about looking the best, making the most money, and having the best personality. To be honest maybe i just havent meet the right people but what really hurts is to think true love does not exist. Reall friends are impossible to find or maybe its just me and my crazy self.....ÊTwo years ago i changed my life around to a more positive lifestyle . But i still feel alone . And sometimes i just feel that maybe i say i turned my life around to find something i feel i changed to feel in a safe zone with myself or maybe even better about me . I think the truth is i still have no idea who i am . I wsh sometimes i just had someone there guiding me the whole way lol but true. I get sad because there is no one i feel can understand me, even though i have a great family thats always there with open arms and with the greatest advice .ÊI have been like this since i was a little girl . But even then i never had guidence i never had much support at all i feel i was just there but no one truly asked about my day when i was little or cared if i did homework or not . I still feel lost and alone as i did when i was little .I just want to understand me and be comfortable with me and just be okay with me , even if i never get to know who i am really . I dont think anyone really knows .. But correct me if im wrong...ÊThis is it for now...
