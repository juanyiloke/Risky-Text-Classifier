PaliperidoneIve been taking this medication for 3 months by injection once a month. it contains my positive symptoms but I feel sleepy, my speech is less fluent and I thus feel like I don't want to talk. i have shorter concentration ,i struggle to read passed a paragraph and i struggle to actually read words in order. it also effects my libido.they say this is one of the newer antipsychotics with less side affects, having been on haldol previously I beg to differ as the side affects of paliperidone seem to be as great as Haldol. Anyone else on paliperidone, or on medication for schizophrenia they are happy with. specifically meds that contain delusional beliefs?
