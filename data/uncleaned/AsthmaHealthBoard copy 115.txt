Bronchitis induced asthma??________________________________________I had bronchitis before Christmas. Went to the dr and got a z pak and albuterol inhaler. Z pak helped but I have a lingering cough, but not the same kind of cough I had when I was sick. It's not a productive mucusy cough. It's like when I exhale, I feel like I can't exhale completely and my lungs try to force out the air in the form of a cough, if that makes sense. The cold air really triggers it and I'll have coughing fits (which often makes me pee a little, curse you weak pelvic floor muscles from having a kid! Lol) Anyway could this be asthma that was caused by the bronchitis? Is it just asthma like symptoms from it? Will it go away? Does anyone have experience with this?
