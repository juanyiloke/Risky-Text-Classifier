Distressed about my obesityHello,It's been several months since I've posted here.I am en route to an ANAD support group this morning.Don't know if I can share this in the group.I am in so much pain and distress about my weight. I do not feel comfortable where I am with my weight.I have been struggling with my weight since I was 14 years old and my doctor suggested I lose some weight for health concerns. According to him, I wasn't at a healthy weight for my age and height. I don't want to give numbers here b/c I know it's a trigger for folks, but this should give you an idea.I had been over-exercising at the time he put me on that diet. I was not eating enough food. A college nurse told me ~10 years ago I should have been eating much more than I was due to my workouts.The first day on his diet, I ate much less than usual and and gradually ate a little more and a little more through the first night.The next day, I restricted at breakfast because of the guilt I was feeling from what I'd "overeaten" the night before. I now know, 30 years later, that is not a good practice.I have been on an undereating/overeating pattern ever since, and just gained, gained, gained. Slowly but surely, and after 30 years, it has really added up.I must leave now for group. Will right more later, Thank you for reading.
