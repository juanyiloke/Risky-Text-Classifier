New to Lung CancerHi! A little over a month ago I found out I had NSC Squamous lung cancer. It came as a shock but I'm kind of over that now. I'm an uninsured veteran so I'm going through the VA and so far I've had a CT scan, Broncscopy for biopsy, a PET scan that showed that it hasn't spread and another broncscopy to stop the bleeding. The VA is doing the chemo and they're sending me to the Davis Cancer Center across the street for radiation. This is in Gainesville, Fl. I live in Lake City, Fl. so I will be staying a the Hope Village during the week during treatment.I go tomorrow for another consult with radiation and another CT. On 2/21 I get a port put in at the VA. Then I guess we're ready to go. Radiation 5 days a week and chemo 1 day a week.I forgot to mention above that I'm a 64 male and the cancer is Stage 3. There's more to this story but these are the basic facts. About as much as I can concentrate for a few mins. lolThanks for reading and I welcome any comments.Robertstage 4 NSCLC with brain cancer diagnosed on Jan. 9th, 2014HiI am a male, 76 years old, and stage 4 NSCLC with brain cancer diagnosed on Jan. 9th, 2014. I am a heavy smoker for more than 50 years and quited smoking 6 years ago. There are one big leison in right lung, several small ones in left lung, and one tumor around 1 cm in right side of the brain. It seems really bad. The doctor recommeded to have a radiation therapy for the brain first, then either radiation therapy or chemo to the chest. I am going to have an MRI on the brain first to see if they could just do radiation therapy at the one spot.I don't have any symptoms yet, but I guess they will come soon. Thanks for this forum. I have a place to come, share my thought and get advices.Robert
