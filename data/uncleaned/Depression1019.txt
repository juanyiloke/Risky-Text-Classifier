Something happened yesterday that made me realise what a horrible person I amhI everyone, I'm not sure if this is where i start but here goes. I think i have depression or a mental health issue as I have been having rollercoaster ride emotions and I'm just not the person i want to be anymore. Im 49 and something happened yesterday that made me realise what a horrible person i am and for the first time, i knew what it felt like to be hated and it was not in a good situation. Ive been trying to work out whats wrong with me without bothering anyone about it but clearly I need help because i am so tired some days and on others i don't want to be here anymore. Im full of anger and rage and chronic pain from back and neck injuries and i feel overwhelmed with life and everyday living and i say things in anger and resentment and i don't know whats wrong with me. I told someone (a relative) yesterday that i am barely hanging onto life somedays. I don't want to spoil certain occasions so ive been fighting it and my husband has no idea and would just think I'm an idiot anyway. I just want someone to understand what I'm feeling and to tell me its ok to be like i am or is it? I don't know anymore.
