terrified of gaining weight..Im 15, ive been recovering from anorexia for 7 months now I want to get to a normal weight but now more and more people are telling me im improving a bit, its good to know but its making me feel fat and want to lose weight and drop to 6 stone again, even when they say your improving but still too thin but i still want to be thinner...! I hate food and recovery is so hard, is it normal in recovery to want to cry and lose weight when you see the scale numbers go up a few and people tell you your getting bigger?Just want to be rid of anorexia already
