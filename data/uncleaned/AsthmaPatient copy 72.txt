Get your asthma reviewed I have been asthmatic for as long as I can remember and I am now 35 years old. For the last 15 years it has been well managed and I have only had to use Salbutamol every now and again - however the last 6 - 12 months I have become increasingly breathless - relying on my salbutamol inhaler at least 5 times a day.I saw my GP and was put back onto becotide (brown inhaler!) and that is where I remained. I provided peak flow readings - approx 190 am and 230 pm - best recorded 250!I have since changed doctors and have been to see the asthma nurse - I had to see her every 2-4 weeks for two months whilst my meds were changed but what a difference.I have spent a month on Serevent and becotide and feel like a new person - peak flow now 380 am and 400 pm - best ever 470 today!!!Seen the nurse again and now going to change to combo inhaler.I am no longer breathless - I do not need to to have salbutamol n every pocket, glove compartment, hole. I have energy. I am not longer tired.GET YOUR ASTHMA REVIEWED&gt; It could save your life.
