ÊFinding Faith, FAITH in GodFaith comes in different guises to different people, Faith in God is special. Even if, only for a little while, I watch a programme 'Touched by an Angel' daily on Sky freeview (UK) Ch184 @ 1800hrs. I find it inspiring and uplifting.I know it is ALL fictional, yet, it brightens up my day and maybe yours too?During my more distressing and unhappier times, this programme helps me to rationalise my ignorance to what I thought God should be doing to help me, where I've come to accept that I should always... well, realise that God is love and many other things and that I should know that He loves me, the understanding of everything else... will come in time, for me with patience.
