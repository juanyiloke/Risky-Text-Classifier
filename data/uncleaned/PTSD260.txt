is this a flashbackby dh6868 » Wed Jul 02, 2014 2:47 amLooking for help determining if this could be a flashback.At night in bed, I woke up and "saw" a figure outside my bedroom door watching me. I could find a part of my thinking brain that said, that is just a reflection of the front porch light shining through the hallway onto a hall closet door. The entire rest of me couldn't hear that and believed that it was a person watching me. I had to stay very still, make sure my breathing was steady and basically do everything I could to try to make sure the figure thought I was sleeping and did not know it was there. I was hoping it would get bored with me and not try to come into the room. If it did come in, I knew my best chance was to still pretend I was asleep.
