War DigsI've just watched the above named programme on TV .......The team were digging for a certain Spitfire which had been reported as having crashed in a particular spot during WW2 . It starts off looking good  , bits of the plane start coming into view , then suddenly they stop the dig  , and stop the TV crew filming..........They have spotted bits of a parachute IN the cockpit area of the wreckage ...( the Spit they were looking for , it had been reported that the pilot had baled out ) .Cutting a long story short  , the remains of the pilot were still in the wreckage....a 24 year old R.A.A.F. pilot.They eventually managed to verify his ID , and were able to contact his family in Australia  , and his remains were then given a formal full military burial in France with his family there .
