Drug CultureThen there is the drug culture of psychiatry, everything has to have a pill, even if the pill is off label and wasn't created for the problem, it will do. Sessions after initial assessment with a psychiatrist, usually last 15 minutes (at $250 a session at the very least in private practice), with some conversation about how you are doing and then the sales pitch about a drug that might “help”. In a society where we have a “war on drugs”, drug companies and drugs are one of the biggest money making schemes ever invented – what complete and total HYPOCRISY. No wonder there is such violent opposition to anything that even suggests an alternative treatment or resolution. What would most psychiatrist do if the did not have drugs to sell you in a session? Probably would be out of work or have to work? Not talking about this aspect in a mental health community is like watching a punk in the neighborhood sell shit to kids and say nothing about it as he rides around in Mercedes to his McMansion and the kids have crappy cars, living from disability check to disability check, with no future but addiction and dependency.
