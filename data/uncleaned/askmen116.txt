What do you consider a good salary2011-08-23, 08:37 PMWhat do you consider a good salary for a non doctor or lawyer, etc. in the northeast of the United States.ÊThis year I have my first chance, in my mid thirties to achieve a salary of 100K. I almost felt good about this but then learned that guys seven years younger than me had already achieved this within my company with only marginally more skills.ÊI'm concerned I have sold myself short. I do feel fortunate to have the potential to make six figures but felt a little silly that I've been working so hard and it has taken so long.ÊI have a family now and while all of our needs are met, it is still a legitimate struggle for us. We live very modestly too.ÊThanks,AG
