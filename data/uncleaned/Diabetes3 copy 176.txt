Retinal ScreeningOn Wednesday I got a phone call about my appt for Thursday saying that the camera was not working and could I come to Aberdeen (70 miles round trip) to have it done on the Thursday where they would fit me in or wait until April for it. Any way went in to where it was at Aberdeen royal infirmary walked in at 08:55 and had it done and walked out at 09:25 was told I would get word back in a couple of weeks. also left some leaflets about the forum with them and the woman took them and said she had to ask her boss before she could put them out.
