out of controlI have suffered from bulimia since 1998. I havn't recieved any medical attention and nobody close to me knows I'm bulimic. I basically stopped purging in 2009 but I did not stop the binging, resulting in a massive weight gain (I now weight 17st!). I don't know what to do; I don't know how to eat normally and I have started to purge again. I am reluctant to go to my doctor as I am embarrased and ashamed. Either way my health is suffering and I feel disgusted in myself. I have no self control!
