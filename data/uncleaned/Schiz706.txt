ÊMedication questionsHi there, new to the forum. A bit about me.I have had Schizophrenia since being a child. I am 32 now.I have been on a plethora of medication with varying affects.Currently I am taking 600mg of Quetiapine at night along with Zopiclone 7.5mg (sometimes two) to help me sleep.I also take Diazepam 5mg sometimes up to three times a day.My main problem is Quetiapine makes me feel like a zombie and I don't feel it helps much in terms of dealing with hallucinations.However without taking it I can't sleep a wink. Ive been awake for sometimes days on end without taking it.Does anyone have any positive experiences taking it? Or perhaps there is something that works better out there i've not tried.I was on aripiprazole for a while which seemed ok, but I was getting early signs of tardisive (sp?)In a ideal situation i'd like to feel awake and feel as though I have aspirations to do something other than sitting about like a vegetable like this drug makes me feel.Any suggestions would be great.Thank you
