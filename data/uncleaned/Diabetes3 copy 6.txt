Best HbA1c ever!I am gobsmacked!!Just got back from daughter's annual review. For the last year and a half her HbA1cs have been pretty static around 51-53 (6.8-7%). I was reasonably happy with this but would like it a bit lower, we did get a 47 once when she hadn't been on the pump long but have never managed to get anywhere near as low as that since.Today's result was..... (drum roll) ..... 43! (6.1% I think)   Well obviously I am pleased, but I really don't know how we've done it, in fact I even asked the consultant if she'd got the right sample!! Apart from getting night time numbers under slightly better control recently I can't think of anything else. Have actually noticed that the standard deviation has improved quite a lot recently but i don't really know why, we haven't been doing anything differently at all! That is officially her lowest ever!Yay   . Let's hope we can make it last!
