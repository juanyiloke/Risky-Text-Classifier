Stopping Victoza and going onto Lantus Solostar - advice on dosage  11  After 2 years on victoza, the wonder drug is not working for me, my sugars are way too high and I have lost control, I used to take lantus optiset ( no longer avaiable) before Victoza, but at least I could adjust the dosage if my sugars rose or dropped.I am collectng my lantus Solostar today and wonder what dosage I should start with?  My sugars are 12 -14 on waking and get as high as 21 after meals. I also take 4 metformin and 4 glicazide a day.  My Vicotza dose is 1.2 any advice would be appreciated. thanks
