What do you do to treat yourself?The catch is without hardly spending anything I buy a €1 scratch card almost every saturday (its very small, but the excitement to scratch it never fails)Read the news papers at the weekend with a nice cup of coffeeLovely fresh bedsheets every weekendWatching mind-altering brain trash like Made in Chelsea and secretly loving it.I know this mightnt be directly treating myself, but I like to do something nice for someone (how ever small it may seem), at least once a day/week/help in some way. Even if its only an ear to lend. Or a open a door for someone, or a smile and a how are you to a random stranger.
