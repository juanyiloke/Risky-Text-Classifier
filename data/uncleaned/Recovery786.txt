Thoughts on a budget recipe: for those with BPDFirst, let me say I'm not a dietitian, so seek the best advice for you. Second, I'm not God's gift to cooking, so I hope some replies to this thread comes up with even better suggestions!Here's an impromptu dish I cooked tonight. First, peeled and diced 2/3 of a Spanish [purple] onion, they taste better and don't make cry [crying while dicing onion with a sharp knife should be avoided]. Thinly slice some fresh ginger, then lightly braise both in olive oil laced with mixed herbs. As this is starting, set rice to cook in a rice cooker [which can act as a timer for the main dish]. Back to the frypan [mine is a highsided frypan/wok with also doubles as a casserole dish].Dice a carrot or two, then a zucchini or marrow, into the pan. Add a tin of champignons and a tin of peeled/diced tomatoes then a 200g tin of tuna. I also add a goodly slurp [technical term] of medium cooking sherry. If you prefer your zucchini al dente, add it later not sooner. Dinner for four, or four nights sorted out.What does this have to do with BPD you ask? Lots. When travelling in Europe years ago, before my BPD diagnosis, I judged my overall mood by the effort I put into cooking for one. Food also has some traps that not everyone knows. Serving myself some of my appetising Tuna Mush, I added a little Soy for flavour. Soy sauce has a high salt content and I make a practice of using it sparingly. Salt in our diet can leach Lithium from our system. This is why I avoid highly processed foods such as commercial pizza bases [salt content]. Sadly, this means moderating tomato sauce, which is also high in salt.Likewise, high fluid intake can also affect the sodium/lithium balance in our system -- well, it does for me. If I've made a glaring error, please correct me. Otherwise, I'm interested to know your recipe and lifestyle suggestions!
