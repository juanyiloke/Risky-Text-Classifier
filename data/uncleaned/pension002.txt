Hunting with dogs.To chase a wild animal with a pack of dogs until it's exhausted, and then to watch it being torn apart by the dogs while still alive in the name of sport I find totally abhorrent, disgusting, makes me feel physically sick. How does it make you feel? The same I suspect, well most of you.The hunting ban law is back in the limelight as it is shortly to come up for repeal by the government as part of its manifesto promises.That 650 people out of a population of 60+ million can make this decision I also find unacceptable.Each MP has been elected by their electorate to do their bidding, not to follow their own agenda, and I think it imperative that something like this that affects the very survival of our wildlife should be put to each MP's electorate by their MP and the outcome of this poll should be the MP's vote, not his own personal wishes.Please contact your MP and find out how he intends to vote and let him know your wishes. You can do this through the League Against Cruel Sport's websitehttp://www.league.org.ukIf you, like me, love our wildlife, please do this for its sake before it's too late.
