Is plane travel really as bad as I imagine?When you say to someone you are scared of travelling they automatically presume you are scared of the plane crashing and go on about how safe air travel is, I am not scared of it for that reason, its the being in an enclosed space unable to leave that gets me. Being packed in that small space full of people sounds like my idea of hell. What if I go mad and make a show of myself? I'm 35 now and always avoid it for this reason, I suffer the same on buses which is why I avoid them also, 10 mins or more and I start to get panicky.Is it really as bad as I think?
