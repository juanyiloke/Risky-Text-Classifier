: hard to talk but worthy of opening up and asking for helpHi all,I am just another of many trying to stay afloat in the ocean of depression , I just want to share that since i joined beyondblue recently,that i have found in the understanding and sharing of personal thoughts and feelings from others in the same or similar circumstances to my self has been both enlightening  (i am not alone) and very beneficial to my own well being .I have just spoken on the phone to a Councillor  of beyondblue for the first time and this was very helpful in getting me moving towards recovery of a deep depression.Just want to say ... be brave , swallow  the pride and open up ... You''ll never know what is around the proverbial "Blind Corner "... unless we stick our necks out have the guts and have a look whats there.Thank you beyondblue! for providing a positive safe and helpful environment that all at some time need :)Cheers all and safe travels Greg (chip)
