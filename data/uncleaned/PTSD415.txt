ÊRecently diagnosed...feeling guiltyI'm 26 years old, and have just today told my doctors about some severe abuse I've been through since I was 5 or 6 years old until my later teenage years. He's no quack; I've seen doctors since 8 years old. He came to the PTSD diagnosis immediately.ÊHonestly, I feel awful. People around me have been put through my psychological damage for years on end. I've left people out of raw panic, been unable to hold relationships, people have left out of exasperation of being unable to deal with me. I've never held a job for more than a few months. I have triggers and episodes where I go into full blown panic, and regress to a childlike emotional state. Employers didn't want that, obviously.I feel like it's my fault for not saying anything earlier in my life. I've been in therapy for 7 or 8 years and wanted to plenty of times. But that ingrained fear of "What would happen to me if I tell someone?" was still in me.ÊNo matter how much progress I've made, I always relapse. Over and over... This is the first time it's being addressed. Is it my fault? Has everyone been put through hell because I was unable to say things from my childhood sooner?ÊI feel like I can't trust myself anymore. I've always told myself that I just need to try harder and fed myself excuses as to why I kept having episodes. I was weak and needed to do more for myself. I feel like I have no handle on myself anymore. I don't know how to process this or how to even look at it. Am I a hazard for everyone around me? Please tell me this can get better.
