I'm off work with stress.I have been off work since May 2014 with stress. Working for the NHS. ÊHaving to do the work of 4 people in our office, all of which have left and now the load has been shifted onto me. I was getting aches and pains in my chest and went along to the doctor who signed me off for 2 weeks. I had an ECG and that showed up an ectopic heart beat, nothing serious but i could have been brought on with the stress. I worked so hard yet no "get well" card or flowers have been send. It is now 3 months since i have first went off work. I thought i had loads of friends at the place but it turned out that i didnt and it hurts like hell. I have suffered with depression in the past and i feel like i am battling it right now. I have a meeting with occupational health tomorrow. I have my first counselling appointment on tuesday. Alongside that i have a lot of stress at home as well. I just feel like i can no longer cope. I keep telling my husband how i feel but it doesnt seem to do anything. I know he must feel powerless but i need some propping up right now. I want to sit and cry my eyes out all of the time. Thanks for listening.
