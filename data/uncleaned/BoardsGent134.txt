invasive ultrasound on testiclesGoing unreg for this one. Mods feel freee to move if not applicable hereI had reason to have an ultrasound on my testicles last week.This was the fourth such scan in the past 6 months and 4 different radiographers.I had no bother with the first 3 scans and in fact one of them lasted an hour as the consultant had to be called upon to give a second opinion.However the scan last week has left me in a distressed state of mind. As with all scans I relaxed and let the radiographer get on with his job. The radiographer covered my dodger with some paper and applied the gel to the scrotum.However after 20 minutes i felt this urge to ejaculate and when i reached down it was this I realised I had an erection and I ejaculated there and then. I never realised I had had the erection and what an embarrassing moment this was. the Dr. continued on applying the probe to my scrotum as if nothing had happened and when the scan was over 10 minutes later he just asked me if i wanted more paper to clean myself and left the room.I am now wondering what was different in this scan and the previous ones. The one thing I did notice is that the Dr. did not use as much gel as in the previous scans and the probe was generating more heat as it stroked the scrotum. This was what caused the erection but was it me or did the dr. deliberately cause this to happen. Needless to say I left the hospital in a distressed state and I still cant fathom what happened. What do you guys think???
