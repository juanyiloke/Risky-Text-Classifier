tired of trying to breath! Hi All,I had another lovely asthma attack on Saturday but as recently moved and hospital were not fully aware of how severe it can get they chose to discharge me a few hours later onece it appeared to stablised.At my insistance they gave me some pred to take home as i knew I would be back in within 24 hours otherwise and their other advice was to try and manage on my regular inhalers without resorting straight to my nebs!!! Needless to say by that night I was going downhill aagin and needed my nebs! I've got through the weekend but am still struggling so I'm going to see the GP later to see if he can recommend anything else before I wind back up in hospital as I am already on regular theophyline tabs and montalukast as well as all the normal inhalers. I would just love a few hew hours of uninterupted sleep and to breath easilly for a while. The docs were lovely but until they get to know your history and realise how quickly things can go downhill it can be a challenge as my sats often look okay and then they just drop suddenly but until they see it for themselves they dont realise how quickly you can go from appearing stable to unstable and I'm normally to tired by that point to explain so sooner I see the respiritory team the better really! moan of the day over!
