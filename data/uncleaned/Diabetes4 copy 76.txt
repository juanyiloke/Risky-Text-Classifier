Rubbish readings to take to GP tomorrowHi Well I am truly shocked! I have been testing a bit this week and quite a lot today and am seeing terrible results! Seeing GP tomorrow so will be taking readings and meal diary. Sore belly button is healed now with canestan so looks like it was a spot of thrush - mild joint issues are still there  Today had fasting of 17.7 at 7.30am at about 10.30 I had a massive hot flush (signs for me of liver dump) at work and tested 15 mins later a 20! ate some cashew nuts and hour later was 19.3; half an hour later before lunch was 15.9; 2hrs later 18.1; hour and half after that 16.6. Before dinner 13.2 hour and hour & half later 15.1.Have been eating what I ate when I got things under control (could reduce carbs a bit but wanted to see what was happening without changing) - TodayBreakfast 2 slices Burgen toast butter Bovril and cup of teamid morning the cashew nutsLunch Mediterranean couscous (leaving the dried fruit), coleslaw and chicken breast with 2 tsp St augur cream cheese.Dinner chicken breast purple sprouting broccoli and a small carrot with butter on the veg.
