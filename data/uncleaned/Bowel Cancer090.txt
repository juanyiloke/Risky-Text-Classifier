And the results are in.....Morning all,Just got back from my morning in hospital. Good news - the scan results show all the tumours are stable. One on the liver has got ever so slightl bigger (2mm), but was reassured that statistically, in his opinion, my oncologist still considers this to be stable rather than growing.Next stage is to continue on the chemo as I seem to be tolerating it well and it's doing the job. I asked about considering further alternatives, such as SIRT and he was open to a discussion on this if I remain stable when they re-scan in 3mths time.So, with our flight leaving in 36hrs, we are free to go to Florida and treat the kids to a holiday of a lifetime. I can't wait and it feels marvellous to have bought myself a further 3mths.Hope all others expecting scan results soon can share in some of this good fortune.Cxx
