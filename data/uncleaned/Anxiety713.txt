Could this be anxiety that I'm going throughA couple months ago I started to feel bloated constantly and had trouble sleeping. I took Xanax 1mg. I never took the whole pill though. I would always break it in half. And would take one and the other half the next day or so. about the next week I started to feel better and I stopped taking them. The week after that I went to the doctor about my bloating beforehand and they couldn't find anything wrong. The blood work came out normal. I felt fine until the next week or so, I started to have these pains in my chest. I thought they way go away, but days later it got worse. I'd sometimes feel nauseous and couldn't eat a few bites of meal without feeling full and again had trouble sleeping. That night I took some Xanax and almost instantly felt better afterwards. However I assumed that it was a side effect of another med I was taking which was prescribed when I went to the ER about my bloating. Because I hadn't took any of that med that day.For the next two weeks I took Xanax daily.(Again not the whole pill just half) and now that pain I had before is coming back and I am having trouble sleeping. I recently just learned about the withdrawal symptoms of Xanax and I was thinking maybe that's what it was. However I was informed that the dosage I was taking was too low to have withdrawal symptoms in such a short time(I was taking them for less than two months) Plus I wasn't taking any meds before I started to bloat for the first time..I've learned that anxiety causes many of the symptoms I've been. having. So could that be what this is? I'm also trying to work on gradually taking Xanax at the moment. Because I definitely don't wanna get addicted to them.
