ÊWhen Clozapine doesn't work?I have had several episodes of psychosis since the age of 21 and the only thing that worked was Clozapine, which is the one that took it all away. After taking that I didn't hear another voice. Sadly, I tried to stop taking it so they wuldn't put me on it again - meaning I had disabling voices and hallucinations and disorganised thinking.ÊThis time around, after a psychosis that lasted about 2 years - I started taking it again and it does keep me calm, but it only partially works - I still hear voices and think people in my vicinity are talking about me from time to time. Don't get me wrong - I feel a lot better and its nice to have breaks from hallucinations - but from time to time (especially after cigarettes) it will come back.ÊMy Clozapine is supplemented with Amisulpride. I am also having Psychology.ÊWhat do they do if Clozapine doesn't work?Thanks
