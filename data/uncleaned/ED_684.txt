TeeteringI know I need to reach out to someone. It's Saturday afternoon and I don't know who to talk to, and no one is really available. I am really struggling with this whole recovery thing. I am very close to running away, quite literally, from everything to be able to maintain my ED. I want to lose all the weight I've gained so far. I want to restrict again as that seems to bring some kind of mental peace. I actually told my husband today that I hated him for making me stick to the meal plan. I have three days til I see my psychiatrist (now on weekly visits as he's realised how on the edge I am) and I see my nutritionist the day after that. But I just don't want to do this anymore, ie recover. I feel so much safer here with my ED voice and behaviours. I just need someone to vent to and hear me without encouraging relapse, if that makes any sense.
