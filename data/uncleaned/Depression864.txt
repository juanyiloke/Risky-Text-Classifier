Reasons for why I'd do harm

I know it's too early to think I have no future right now but some days there a huge shiny light at the end of my tunnel and others the tunnel is endless and dark.Ê

I'm typing this today because I need strength. My mom is in a verbally abusive relationship with a man and I can't even stop it. It makes me feel worthless when I hear him call her out of her name, when I see her getting disrespected and I can do NOTHING. She says she can't move out because she has no where else to go and they have a kid together and she doesn't have the money. I understand all that but still. My heart goes out to my mother. She isn't depressed but I am. I feel like I've been dealt bad cards by the game of life. I feel like I'm losing. I lack motivation to do most things and I act in school so that I don't have people constantly worrying about me. Honestly, my heart hurts, it feel pangs of pain and I can't eat. Food looks repulsive. Living with my mom and her boyfriend is taking it's toll. I don't have money or a job, so I've really got no choice.Ê

Still. My father is alive but living with him would be more painful. He's verbally abusive himself. I don't know where anything is going and I'll just take things day by day. My heart really hurts, it's in pain, and it's wounded. Why do I have no power?
