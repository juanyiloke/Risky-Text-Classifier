Different approach to "invasion" of spaces...Funny thing happened yesterday; Went to the gym and there was this lady scrubbing the lockers and benches in the changing rooms. As one would expect, not one guy gave a single f@:k about it, and went on their business changing, taking showers and so on - including myself.ÊOnly a little later it occurred to me - what would have happened if it was the opposite? I mean, guy cleaning the ladies changing rooms? It makes me chuckle a bit, it is quite interesting to see how different the reactions to such a situations are.
