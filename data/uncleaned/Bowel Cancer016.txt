To stent or not to stent...Hello everyone.My tumour is pressing against my left ureta and affecting the flow of wee from kidney to bladder. I have seen a Urologist and talked ablout a stent to support the ureta however the side affects of a stent include infection, blood in wee, bladder irritation etc. She also talked about having a tube to the outside to collect wee in a bag. (Nepfrostomy)I am due to see my Oncologist on the 23rd to discuss more chemotherapy and it might well be that chemo shrinks the tumour away from the ureta thus solving my problem.I am at sixes and sevens about this. Its enough to have the pain of the tumour, and the fact that I have cancer, to deal with but now i have a threat of kidney failure.I have spoken to the nurse helpline about it and got some fantastic advice.Has anyone out there had this sort of stent fitted, or indeed a nepfrostomy???Love & hugsDawnAnn
