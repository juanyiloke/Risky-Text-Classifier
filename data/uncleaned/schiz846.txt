We've been friends since high school so I've known him for about 8 years. When we met he was fairly "normal" , he was one of the coolest kids at school with a 4.0gpa and was known to throw the biggest parties. In the beginning, every so often we would be hanging out and he would suddenly start arguing with people who weren't there. He has gone through a lot of different medications and psychiatrists and it's just been getting worse. He's done some really unusual and crazy things and says the voices told him to do it. One time when he was talking to them I wanted to see what was going on in his head so I kept asking him questions like who's talking to you and what are they saying?! Supposedly its some Cambodian demon from 500 years ago and his wife is looking for me. And sometimes the arguments would get really intense and he would be yelling at the top of his lungs to these voices. It's sad because he has lost almost all his friends because it is really hard to go out with him in public without him making a scene. We were hanging out at my house last night and I had to roll him out because it was late and he was yelling and laughing extremely loud with the voices and nothing I said could stop him. He's caused his parents a lot of stress over the years and it seems like they've pretty much had enough and know they can't do anything about it. I really don't want to see one of my old bestfriends become one of those crazy homeless people that talk to themselves on the streets cause so far this is the path I see him going. Sucks when you have to just stand by and watch his life spiral down knowing there isn't anything anyone can do
