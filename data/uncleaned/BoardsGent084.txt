Men Who Use Women As Safety NetsThis is something I always knew happened, but I've been hearing a lot more about it recently. I'm referring to men who lead women on and make them believe they're in fully committed, monogamous relationships, when in fact the women involved are just 'safety nets' being used for companionship and sex etc, until the man finds someone he truly wants. I think it's worth starting a thread about this to hear opinions as many of us (myself included) sometimes believe that men are at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to sex and love, and that's highlighted by the current threads and replies to them. But this particular issue doesn't appear to affect men as much. This is something I was talking about with a friend last night over a few pints.I'd much rather be unsuccessful with women than be used in such an intimate way. Some of these men are over 30 as well, so it's not like they're very young guys out playing the field - they are mature enough to know better. It really puts things into perspective when you think about this kind of stuff. I'd be particularly interested in hearing what some of the ''women have it much easier than men'' brigade have to say about this, but all replies are welcome.
