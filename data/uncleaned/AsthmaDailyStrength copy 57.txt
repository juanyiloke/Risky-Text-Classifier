Hi I just joined this group (although I have been on DS for a few years now). About 2 weeks ago I had a massive asthma attack (started to get better and then had another even worse one) and I am still recovering. It's really starting to scare me. I am a lot better then I was. But I still can't really exert myself at all. I have to take my puffers a lot still just to sit still(although not as much as before) and I am going back to work tomorrow and I am scared. I haven't been in 2 weeks because I haven't been able to breathe. (My job isn't sedentary; it's childcare so I am very busy ALL day). But I can't be off forever...it's only one day then I am off again but it's still worrying me. So I am very worried about coping at work tomorrow. But mostly because I am taking so long to recover...I'm scared I am never going to be able to function properly again. My asthma has never been this way. I have had asthma my whole life. But it's always been pretty mild; I can get out of breathe easy and have days I need my puffers but I have never needed them all the time. I have never had my chest so tight and been that out of breathe I couldn't move and it had never lasted this long. In the past if it was bad it was because I had a chest infection brought on by the flu. Once I got better so did my chest. I am just scared this will be forever now since it is taking so long and it still feel bad...like I am just on the edge of having a bad attack if I move around too much. I haven't been able to exercise...do housework or anything that needs doing just in case. Mainly because I think I had the second attack because that day I had tried to do a few things in the house. And I have been trying to take it very easy so I can get to work tomorrow. Do you think I will be like this all the time now? Is it normal to take this long to get back to normal after an attack? Any thoughts or advice? Thanks :)
