ÊNot feeling real/awake.Ever since I woke up this morning, nothing feels real. I kind of feel like I'm still in my nightmare. Nothing around me feels real. I'm not sure how to describe it. Just.. Feels fake. The air and everything even feels fake. My body feels fake. I'm still waiting for the police to show up at my door from my nightmare. I've went back to sleep several times but time is going by so unbelievably slow. 5 minutes feels like an hour. I'm not even sure if I can really feel emotion right now. That's what makes me think I'm still some how asleep.ÊHas this happened to anyone else?
