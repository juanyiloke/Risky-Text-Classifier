bitching - is it just part of life?Not sure if this is the right forum for this subject, considered posting in after hours but would get ripped to shreds there! I have only recently moved back to my home town after living in Dublin for a number of years. I would only have been home for weekends before. The one thing that strikes me is the amount of bitching, nosiness and also jealously that there seems to be. Don't get me wrong I have to admit that I gossip also but not to the level that seems to be going on. It also seems that some people seem to take joy in other peoples misfortunes. Seems to me that some people could nearly tell you what you had for breakfast by nightfall! Is it just me or is this part of life and while it's not something that I should accept it is something that I should just face up to?
