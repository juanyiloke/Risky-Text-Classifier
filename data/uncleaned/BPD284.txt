Êcan't take it anymoreHi. Sorry it's a long post but I'm really on my own at the moment and need to rant. I live with my partner. He used to work and mum used to look after me. But she never came to me I had to goto her house. Poor excuse all the time. So my partner gave up work and I cancelled the the carers and transferred to him. That was 2 year ago. I have emotionally unstable borderline personality disorder. Lots of self harm and suicide attemps well since making my partner my carer my mum has made my life hell. I've never told her I canceled the carers allowence. She guessed. So she got put on jobseekers. Anyway. Mum and my partner don't get on at all. Other stuff has gone off in the past too. So recently he's had a major argument with my family. And it's really knocked me off the scales I lost my uncle 3 weeks ago and funeral is next week so I'm a mess. So as it was new year yesterday we both had a drink of alcohol. He kept going on about hating my family for what they are doing to me. So I. Got really upset and went off my head and ended up just thrashing all my medication in the sink and attempted to take my own life in front of him. I was histerical. I wanted to die so bad. I am sorry for him to witness that but I just wanted out of this life. I can't live with them fighting all the time. I really can't win. I just want peace. And I don't no what to do because I don't want to hurt anyone.i can't tell him how I feel. What do I do now. ?Xx
