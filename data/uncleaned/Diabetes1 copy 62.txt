Which insulin pump would YOU choose?My 12-year-old son wants an insulin pump! He's a good kid, organized, gets good marks in school and plays sports. He's been giving himself multiple daily injections ever since he was 8 years old; he's had type diabetes since he was 3 years old. He loves gadgets and has decided he wants an insulin pump. I don't know anything about insulin pumps and to tell you the truth, they freak me out. I know it won't seem so scary once we take the classes, but for now, we haven't even decided on a pump, yet; so one step at a time! I'm taking my son to see his doctor soon, but for now, she faxed me a list of all the available insulin pumps to choose from. My head is spinning! I don't know what's more important, size, weight, connection; I don't even know what any of these things mean! I'm going to list all our choices and I would really appreciate it if someone who knows something about pumping (and 12-year-old boys!) would recommend the best one. Right now, for me, it's a guessing game. Ultimately, it will be my son's decision, but I'd like to get him off on the right foot. It's a big decision for a 12-year-old boy; he needs a little backup! So, if anyone could please help me decide before I show my son, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.
