GAD and playing musical instrumentHi all im looking for a bit of advice on self help.Ive been a sufferer of GAD for several years and after cbt, etc it never went away but i have grown used to it.As a child i was very musical, and recently got back into it and started taking lessons and learning an instrument. So far ive found it very rewarding and enjoyable, and helps me to relax and if i struggle to sleep i think of a piece of music or scale and this helps.The problem i am having, is my anxiety problem is rearing its ugly head in lessons. Often for no reason. So im looking for advice / self help for before and during lessons, even if its just relaxation exercises, to help reduce my anxiety or bring it back under control during lessons
