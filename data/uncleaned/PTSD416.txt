ÊDoes anyone else swing between SU and HappyThis is kind of weird. I've been su on some level most of my life. But lately, like in the past couple of years, my life has gotten a lot better. I've finished retraining, and am starting a job search workshop. I'm writing a lot, I've got a book deal, I have great friends. Honestly most days I'm pretty happy and enthusiastic about life. I've overcome most of my ptsd symptoms except the nightmares, but I can cope with those. I've even quit drinking.My problem is every once in a while I get intensely su and just want to die. I'm not depressed - I just don't see any point in living.I never thought I'd live past 30 and I'm 46 now, so I guess I figure I've had bonus time.It's just disturbing.Does anyone else find they go between major extremes like this?splitimage
