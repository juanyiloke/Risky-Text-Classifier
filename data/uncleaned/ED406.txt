ÊFirst appointment loomingHi. I had bulimia for about 10 years but have been recovered for about 12 years. Over these last few weeks/months a lot of the thoughts and feelings have returned although I haven't been sick. I am on my own eating plan and have been losing weight - I am upper end healthy weight. Of course I feel enormous and disgusting. I am rarely off the scales and cannot stay from my list of safe foods. On Thursday I confided in a nurse at my work and she has referred me to a counselor who will come in to my work place. I should here about an appointment in the next few days and my first appointment could be this coming week. I am now today panicking and have been tempted to email the nurse to day to cancel it. I'm not being sick so maybe I am okay. I think all the obsessive behaviors and thoughts will disappear when I lose the weight I need to lose. Just so stressed by it all and scared of seeing a counselor.
