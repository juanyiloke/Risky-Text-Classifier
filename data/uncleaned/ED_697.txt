I don't know if something is wrong...I went to see my therapist and she said that I eat half at most of what I should eat. She seems to think I can snap out of it and eat healthily. I only brought it up with her as my friends have noticed a problem with my eating habits. Although my bmi is classed in the normal catagory, I look and feel like a baby whale.ÊBut I refuse to believevsomething is wrong. She doesn't seem to think that I have an eating disorder, but I have nearly all the symptoms. I am not underweight (no where near!) and I don't binge or over eat. I am also purging now. My therapist is good for my depression but is she wrong?I believe this is normal but my family and friends do not.
