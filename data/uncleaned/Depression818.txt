Severe Chronic DepressionThis is probably the worst point of my depression yet.I am a 15 year old male in his sophomore year, I'm LDS (Mormon) and I'm a crier. I cry a lot because I have been treated unfairly by classmates, teachers, and other people. When I come home, I cry for a good 5 minutes, and then get on with anything else I need. I've been separated from my only friends in class and placed with a bunch of potty-mouthed people who don't give a flying buttress about my opinions and never stop telling me to Eff off. I really can't take it. I've considered suicide. I need help. NOW.
