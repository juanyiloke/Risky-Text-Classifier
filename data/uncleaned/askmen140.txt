Business Partners2011-11-09, 05:06 PMI have a personal need - but also thought others in the forum would be interested in the replies that may come...I am looking for a business partner - and am looking to get out of my personal circle. Does anyone have suggestions on how to network (digitally or otherwise) with people in the "business" world? I am not looking for venture (at this time). I am looking for people in the business world who are looking to get out of Their circle and network with "creatives".Any suggestions would be appreciated.
