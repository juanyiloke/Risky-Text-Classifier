Small cell lung cancer. After diagnosis 5 years ago with advanced PCa I was shocked recently to be told that I had a nodule growing in my lung. My oncologist was concerned that the PCa was behaving irraticly . My last scan in October showed mataseses had spread to spine,ribs,shoulder,right shin and left foot. Things moved quickly in November and by the 12th I had seen the surgeon and was booked in for a lung resection. The surgeon removed the nodule by way of a Vats (keyhole) and it was sent off for analysis whilst I waited on the table. The result was inconclusive. The surgeon is certain he has removed all the damaged lung but more tests would be needed. Two weeks later and the worst was confirmed. Small cell lung cancer. Still convinced he had removed all the damaged tissue he ordered a Pet scan. I had a pet scan at new year and will hear the result Monday. Then it's decision time again.Nec Aspera Terrant Difficulties Be Dammed
