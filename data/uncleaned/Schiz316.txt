As many of you know, I worked as a psych nurse at a private treatment center for 5 years. I managed the center, and had over 50 patients under my care. It was an amazing and very progressive company to work for, and I've missed it greatly since I've been disabled and unable to work.
But within the last year, things have gotten expontentially better for me. I've been able to live independently, go outside and to public places, and even begin a serious relationship. I felt the next logical step for me would be to return to nursing.
A few weeks ago, I was speaking with my former employer, the owner of the treatment center I used to manage, and she brought up an interesting offer to me. It was so good, and such a perfect fit for me, that I couldn't refuse!
So as of last week, I've been working for the company as a nurse case manager. It's my job to oversee the care of our patients from admission, to discharge, to returning to normal functioning. I ensure that they are receiving the best evidence-based care, refer them to specialists and community resources, manage their medical and financial benefits, and even consult with their family treatment teams.
It's taken awhile to get used to the stress and schedule of working again. But I can truly say that I am LOVING what I'm doing everyday, and I'm SO happy to be able to help people again as a nurse.
And of course, there is no way I could've done this without the constant support and inspiration that I've received as a member of this forum over the last year. So many of you have helped and motivated me when I needed it the most. So I hope that I will be able to continue to support you in the same way 
I wanted to share my awesome news with you guys!
Many Blessings,
Anthony
