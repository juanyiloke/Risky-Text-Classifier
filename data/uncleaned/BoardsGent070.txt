Tight foreskins and the boards search resultsLong story short, my foreskin was too tight to retract and I fixed it with stretching over about two months.Obviously I started the progress with googling and I read posts across a few websites, most advocated stretching.The issue being that the first website to tell me that stretching was ineffective was the first search result for the issue on boards where a number of people state outright that it doesnt workI like boards, I post here and most of the people here do their best when people ask for advice.I was quite upset with the prospect of circumcision (perhaps irrationally I'm unfamiliar with the process) the boards posts nearly made me avoid stretching altogether.I know it's something that may work for some and not for others but I'd advocate at least trying it and I'd like to have a record of the other side of the debate appear on boards for someone in my situation.This can all be avoided by going to the doctor and just asking (which you should defintely always do first) but I'm the first to admit that it may not be the most appealing prospect to some.Êhope this helps someone
