Hello everyoneHi everyone. I'm Klein and been diagnosed with lung cancer. Ironic that I never really smoked anything, nor did anyone close to me have this habit..Currently at T2b stage.Still, keeping the positive attitude towards everything. If anything, it has shown me just how fragile we really are. Made me appreciate the moment..Will be trying chemotherapy once I've got the funds for it. So yeah, I'll see you around.
