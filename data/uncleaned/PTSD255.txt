Do I have PTSD? possibly DID? Sexually detailedby zorn31 » Thu Aug 14, 2014 2:33 pmHello this is my first post so my formatting won't be great. I am a 21 year old male. I normally don't have any issues like anxiety. I have been depressed for a long time and recently I have gotten mild anxiety attacks. These past three days I have had a constant anxiety attack with chest pains can't breath nauseous. The heart of the matter is this, I was engaging in sexual activity with my girlfriend of almost five years(no intercourse). I was letting her try this new toy(anal toy) on me. Everything was going as well as it could for the situation lol. The whole time i was feeling strange like I was a women. When we were finished I was telling her how I felt like I could be me finally because I've recently started thinking I was bisexual and it was bothering me and I also have urges to do girly things. But normally I'm a very "manly" seeming guy listens to metal plays video games. While we were laying there talking I started crying randomly and panicking I stood up and I was walking around and she was trying to calm me down because she has ptsd herself. She was like lets put our clothes back on I walked out into the hall while still crying and panicking to get to my closet. I had to walk back into the room and asked her to get me clothes because I was crying and panicking so much. She grabbed clothes for me and was going to take I shower but I was chanting "I need to hide I need to hide". I went into our third guest bedroom and hide in the tiny closet for half and hour. Until she coaxed me to come out after her shower. For the rest of the night I didn't say anything and was almost in a trance just laying half asleep on the couch. Thats the details I can think of you can ask questions or what not. Thanks for the help
