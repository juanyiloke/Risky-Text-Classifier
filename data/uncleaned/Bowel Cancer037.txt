Bowel control after reversal operationI had a reversal op about 3 months ago and although I have improved from the constant diarrhoea of the first 2 weeks, I still have no control over my bowel and I am wearing incontinence pads which have to be changed between 8 and 14 times a day. I have received conflicting dietary advice from the professionals and although I am keeping a diary of what I eat there seems to be little pattern apart from one or two things which I think I must avoid (e.g food with a lot of sugar; lemon ; sherry). The surgeon has told me that if I haven't improved in a year I should contact him and he will replace the stoma bag but I don't think I can face that. I have just discovered the advice about exercises which I will follow.I feel healthy but am worried about going to the theatre and similar venues in case I start to smell.A friend of mine said he was back to normal after a month but he didn't have a stoma bag and therefore didn't have a reversal op. Am I being impatient? I would love to hear other's experiences.
