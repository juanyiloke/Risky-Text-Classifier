BronchitisI seem to have come down with bronchitis. I am very scared. I had my standard chemo last wed. Then family was here visiting. I worked on Monday. Started not feeling well Tuesday. Had the trial drug yesterday then came home. I have a zpak and am staying hydrated. Woke up today feeling my worst yet. I'm seeking some guidance here. I hope it's from the kids and not work. If it's something I picked up from work then I'm in trouble. I love my job and need to be productive. I'm already OCD when it comes to hand washing and cleaning my equipment. Thoughts?Lisa,Irish feel free to move this if it should go somewhere else.
