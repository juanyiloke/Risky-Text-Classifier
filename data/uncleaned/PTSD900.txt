 Evil thoughtsThey're worse again and flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, self doubt, it's all going round and round in my head, what I'd like to do to those horrible people and wish would happen to them. Apart from that I've been taking the meds, trying to do a bit more to regain some sort of balance in life for some of the time to try make it all stop, small breaks are better then none at all and don't know why I'm writing this, just having a good old grumbleDon't give up on not giving up
