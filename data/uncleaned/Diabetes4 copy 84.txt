Yay!!!!!!!!!!!Just bought a loaf of LivLife in Waitrose!  Went to their welcome desk to say thanks for putting it back on the shelves (as a speciality bread and not just hidden away on a low shelf where it can't be seen).  The young lady said that it was a supply problem and not that Waitrose had just decided to take it off the shelves for profit reasons.  For those of you who miss bread then this is for you (if you want it of course).  3.8 carbs per slice and absolutely lovely.  Sainsburys were doing Hi-Lo (low carb) bread but that now seems to be missing.  I was told when it would be arriving (I got the last loaf) and also to come to the desk if it disappears again and they will tell my why!  All in all quite pleased.
