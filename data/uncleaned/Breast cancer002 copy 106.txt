hair dye patch test¥	Morning ladies hope you are all as well as can be expected, I recently posted a discussion on dye after chemo ( finished chemo jan) well just an update, I went to a hairdressers yesterday morning and they did a patch test behind my ear and told me to wait 48 hours,  I now know how VINCENT VAN  GOFF felt!! Within the hour it started to burn like the fires of hell, it's all red and blistered, it feels twice as big as the other one, the moral of this woeful tale is Get a patch test done, imagine if that had been put straight on my head, I'd have had to do the ice bucket challenge in the middle of the hairdressers xx
