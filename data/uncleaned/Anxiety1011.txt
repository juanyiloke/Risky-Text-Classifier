imitation of someone I don't like? Help. Panic attack (sorry about my english) --- So, there's this person in my class, and he's very annoying. He thinks only his opinions are valid and true, and things like that... for him, other people opinions are always wrong... It's very annoying to talk with someone like that. He's always saying like "Ok, prove me that your point is legit"..... about everything.... If I say that I like the color Blue, he will say: Explain me why blue is good..... Annoying!That said, yesterday I was talking with a good friend of mine, and she asked me about which toothpaste I like to use.... i said X and she said she like Y. That's when things got terrible for me, because I naturally catch myself asking her to defend her choice for me... to explain me why Y.Yes, the behavior that I completely Hate. And I was doing the same. And it was not an intrusive thought. No... it came naturally. That's why it's killing me. I don't want this! Now I feel i'm like this annoying guy. It's terrible.Now i'm having panic attacks about it. Can someone give me a outside vision? Is it normal to end up imitating some behaviors?
