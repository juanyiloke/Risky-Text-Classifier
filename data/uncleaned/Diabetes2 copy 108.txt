Diabetes without injections   I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a number of years ago and dutifully took my daily insulin which over the years increased to 90 units a day with my HbA1c averaging 7. There must be a better way I thought and committed myself to a program that would take my body back to a time when the only reason to visit my doctor was to sign my passport. This journey involved shedding 21lbs, altering my diet to real healthy eating and gradually reducing my insulin intake to zero. Getting to a zero insulin intake took six months of hard work but has been well worth the effort with some additional beneficial side effects reduced my blood pressure to 110/67 reduced my cholesterol eliminated my arrhythmia improved my eyesight reduced my medication with the hope for further reductions later this year. It certainly seems very strange that with the increasing numbers of people being diagnosed who are never told that reversing your diagnosis can be achieved without medication. I certainly was never told and I assume that many people will be in my position.
