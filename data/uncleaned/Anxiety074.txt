Do your anxiety symptoms last for  /weeks? Êover a year  My physical symptoms of anxiety seem to never go away ? does anyone else have the same thing and is this normal? I'm sick of it and because it's always here I think there definately is something wrong with me! It's horrible living like this.Also, when you start to obsess with one symptom (me chest pain mainly breast) I feel like it's actually something serious and its like I'm seeing more symptoms of it being serious. It's hard to describe but if you obsess that much always lookin etc if it possibly for you to make up new physical symptoms in your head?? I'm making myself go mad. Want my pain toGo away and it won't which makes me more anxious.Thanks for reading, Nicola xx
