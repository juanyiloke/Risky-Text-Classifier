A Message That I Didn't Think PossibleAs some of you know I wrote about my pet mouse, Moo on here about my frustration and mix feelings about the whole ordeal.I want to say I very sorry if this is the wrong place to post this and also I hope I dont get into too much trouble for it. =/Not about 20 mins ago or maybe 30. My mother came home from work and I was out in the living room with her saying hi. We talked a little then she got kind of sad but was quite about it too. she calmly told me Moo my mouse had just past. I was in disbelief and shock. I admit hitting myself or something I wanted to do at the time but then I became silent and confused. I dont handle someone passing so well.. even though I only had pets who passed on rather than people I know.But then I realized something I even wrote sorta about on my update about her. I wont explain it here. Since It might be the wrong thread area to post at. Religion wise. It was weird at first but then I sorta understood what happen all day today to me. A message was sent to me.All I can say is I had a long talk with my family mostly my mother. All my family are sad of her passing but my mother is sorta happy for me because I did something I was not going to do. I faced my fear or something. Sorry I can't explain it more or make any sense. But I know now she is at peace now.I am still sad some but I know it will pass. What happen to me today was life changing and I think I'm heading on the right path or recovery.I just wanted to share this. Also say to anyone out there who lacks in there own worth on this earth. Don't give up. Maybe not now but you will see it too, Like I did.
