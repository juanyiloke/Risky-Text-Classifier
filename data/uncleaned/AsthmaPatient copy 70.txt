discharge from A and E re asthma I was discharged from local A and E with symptoms, -able to speak in phrases but not sentences - and a PF of 180. My pf best is 400 and average pf plus similar symptoms is 300 appox. I was given six times back to back atrovent nebs which made little overall difference to pf and symptoms, but I think - can't really remember- helped to keep me awake.The most effective treatment was O2 given to me in the ambulance by worried paramed. This was by far the most effective treatment. Better than high dose nebs of salb, atrovent etc.I would like to know if anyone else with asthma has benefitted from the use of oxygen more than the standard treatments often used in asthma exacerbations.Thanks.
