Mixed Feelings About A Former Co-worker's DeathI learned yesterday that a former co-worker, at my previous job, died last week, and my feeling are mixed.He was a bully, and as such, caused me some problems at work. At best I tolerated him, and at worst hoped his medical problems would make him quit, or worse.Now he has died, and honestly, I don't care. However, on the other hand I should care, I should be sympathetic, but I am not.ÊI also struggle with the idea of whether or not I should show up for the wake; part of me says yes, but another part says no. I am afraid of how seeing my former co-workers will affect me. I am truly afraid that it could cause a major trigger seeing them, and that terrifies me.So should I face my fears and refuse to give into avoidance?, Or should I give into the avoidance and stay away.I know that no one can answer the question for me, but posting here, at least, gives me voice to the question.Thanks for reading this.
