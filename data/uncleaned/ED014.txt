Do I need help? Is this ED?I'm not sure if I have an ED, so I'm posting this.(Sorry for any grammatical errors.)My parents didn't have a good relationship, and I grew up watching them fight all the time. I guess that gave me a lot of stress and made me have problems with food just as a way to cope. I started overeating when I was 7, and eventually it made me binge. There were times when I binged and purged because my stomach couldn't handle the food I ate. I quickly gained a lot of weight and I became chubby. When I became 10, I thought that I was too fat and started restrict meals and make excuses. My behaviors became more extreme.I feel extremely guilty after eating a normal-size meal. It's easy to restrict meals. There is no one controlling me. I'm scared. Feeling hungry makes me feel good until I start binging. I try to and want to purge, but it rarely works for me.Is this ED? Do I need help?
