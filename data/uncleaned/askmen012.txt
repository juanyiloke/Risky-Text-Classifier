Should parents tell their kid about secret slush fund?2007-02-12, 03:34 AMSettle a debate:Parents of a 10 year old, puts a chunk of money in a mutual fund the day he is born and have been adding to it every month ever since.They plan to give it all to him when he turns 30 and conservatively calculating, it should total at least 400,000, and maybe double that if the markets do real well.My coworkers are debating, some say it's okay that he knows this money is coming to him while he grows up.Others fear, he'll become a slacker and would not tell him abiut this fund until he is past like, 28 and stuggles past college and career, first home, like everyone else.
