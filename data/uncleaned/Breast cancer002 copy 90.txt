wound not healing¥	Hi all¥	So i had a mascetomy just over 2 weeks ago and unfortunately the wound turned necrotic so i had a 2nd op on Tuesday to debride the wound. Ive been back to hospital today and it appears the wound is not healing so the drain has been kept in and im to go back on Monday. Hopefully it will have improved but if it hasnt im to have further surgery to remove the expander implant. What difference will this make to the wound healing because there is hardly any fluid in it??? Also i attended the fertility clinic today to discuss preserving my eggs before chemo. I found this all very confusing around the hormone stimulating my cancer growth. Is this a risk to my health??? Im thinking it wouldnt be offered if it was but then im not thinking clearly over anything at the minute.¥	Thanks in advance xxx
