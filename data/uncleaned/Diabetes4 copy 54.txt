Carhone Warehouse - the hard sell!I have a bank account with Lloyds where I actually pay them money each month, but I've worked on the principle that if I was to take out mobile phone insurance, car breakdown insurance and holiday insurance (technically unlimited number of holidays, just limited length of stay) it was cheaper for me to do that.I recently obtained a new mobile phone but was talked into having a months free insurance and a promise that it will not renew at the end of the free month. They even said that my existing Lloyds insurance wouldn't cover me for the first month anyway (how would they know?). I'd been thinking about the 'send us £20, diabetes cure' thread and remembered how gullible I might have been with the phone insurance. I can't see any money going from my account, but I need to check it.
