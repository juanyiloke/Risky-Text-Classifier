So many newcomersI am relatively new here at the forum, just a couple of months and I have really grown to love this place. It's a great group of people and I have received amazing support so far, that I appreciate more than words can say.But, I am amazed at the number of new people joining every day, sharing yet another story of lung cancer affecting their parents, their spouses, friends, or themselves. I mean, if I don't visit for a couple of days, then I log on and find so many new posts from people who have just been told about cancer, so many... it's kind of shocking! I guess LC is much more common than I thought... I have read statistics ranking LC so high in the list of cancers, but still, this gets a new dimension when it translates to real people...
