On the verge of being depressed? HELP!I've been like this for over a year now, suddenly i become socially awkward. ONLY around girls i think are better than me (i'm a girl too btw).I'm an extrovert and i talk a lot, but when i'm near these popular (cool girls) i feel like i freeze and i think i can't do anything right! I guess right now they think i'm such a weirdo but i can't help it ... Please help me i'm in pain Because right now i feel like almost everyone is above me and i suddenly become a loner, i wasn't like this a year ago! Why have i become like this...
