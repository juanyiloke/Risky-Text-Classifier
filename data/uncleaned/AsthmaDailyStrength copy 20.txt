Hi everyone, I am having a hard time with my asthma since July. I have had asthma for several years but have always been able to exercise and do normal actives with little limitations. This summer was different I have not been able to climb a flight of stairs or walk any significant distance without feeling weak or light headed. I have done two tappers ofprednisone without any improvements. I am currently on pumocort 180 and singulair . I also do abutorol every four hours. I have been allergy tested and my only reactions are to mold and dust mites. My ige levels are 1500 .... I can never seem to shake a congested feeling in my chest... my allergist says my PFT is right around normal so it must be anxiety but I know it is not. I am not sure what to do ?? I am exhausted all the time and can no longer function properly at work. Does my experience correlate with anyone else?
