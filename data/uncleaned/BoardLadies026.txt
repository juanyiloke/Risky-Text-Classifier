High Heels and the toe tape methos anyone tried it?Hey I just found out about this recently.I wondered if any of you had tried it. You tape the third and fourth toes together and here’s the reasoning, there’s a nerve that splits between those two toes, which causes pain when pressure is put upon it (a.k.a. when you wear heels). The tape removes strain on the nerve. I like heels but after an hour or two ouch! Has anyone tried it and does it work? And is bad for the feet or anything? It would be nice to wear high heels more comfortably!
