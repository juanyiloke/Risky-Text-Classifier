Symbicort vs. Dulera?________________________________________I have my regular Spring trip to the Allergist next week and I haven't been doing that well. Last time my Dr suggested either Symbicort or Dulera if my symptoms were still bothering me during allergy season. I'm currently on Allegra, Flovent and Singulair and I'm having to use my rescue inhaler too much.Any opinions on either Symbicort or Dulera would be appreciated! I don't know which one to choose. I made the mistake of reading online reviews which are all super dramatic. (To be fair, the online reviews for Flovent are just as bad and I have no side effects at all) I've never tried the combo inhalers before and I'm a bit nervous!
