I can't do anything enjoyableI left school and work 6 months ago and didn't go to college because of anxiety. I am finishing going off my meds now because I still had anxiety with it anyway.Now, I can't do anything. I used to watch TV, read books, and watch movies, but I can't anymore now. It gives me too much anxiety. For example, if I am reading/watching something and one of my favorite characters does something I don't like (like kill someone or have an illicit affair) I will get so upset and anxious and I can't deal and I will look up all the stuff online about the bad thing and not go to sleep and it makes everything worse. I also feel guilty like I am the one who did something wrong and I feel like I have to tell someone about what the person did.Also, needing to go to the bathroom gives me anxiety and I am always going to the bathroom and worrying about going to the bathroom. I also worry about eating and weight and whether or not something I eat will make me feel ill and I will begin to feel ill and have gas and abdominal pain after eating and I will worry that something is wrong with me. Please help!
