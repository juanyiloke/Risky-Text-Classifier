  Feel like a new person-Tips that helped meHey folks. About a month and a half ago I was on deaths door and wanted to die so bad. I went on meds but they made things worse. I was about to seriously end it all and decided to give life once last shot and 110% percent to getting better.I suffered from depression, and social anxiety. I have been sexually abused as a child, and became a drug addict later in life for many years. This was not a temporary sad spell for me. Now I don't feel depressed and AS socially awkward. I feel comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life. I feel like I have a chance to be happy and am very content with my life ATM. I have no job, no girlfriend and 2 friends.But I am okay with that.Heres some tips on what I did:Limited drinking. I still have a couple but only a couple once and awhile.I get outside. Even if it is for 20 minutes a day.I exercise or stay busy helping friends and family with yard work etc.When I have a negative thought I acknowledge it and then let it go. Try to put a positive spin on it.I meditate daily- I use CHAKRA meditation to clean and clear my charkras. I use other mediation to quiet my mind. Also use the 528 frequency which helps repair DNA.I realized I don't have to fit societies standards of where I should be and what I should have a this moment. I am taking this life at my own pace. It is a learning experience.It takes so much pressure off.Basically forcing yourself to have positive thoughts will bring a change of mind. It takes time but it can be done.Hope this helps at least one person.
