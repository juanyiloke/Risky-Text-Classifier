MetforminHi I'm type 2I went to see Dr this morningsaw different Dr at the practice, he reviewed through all my medication Previously I was taking 750 mg metformin 3 times a dayhe seemed to think 500mg twice a day is the daily maximum dose? Previous to today's visit I was taking 3 times a day (750mg) morning lunchtime and eveplus novo mix injection morning and evening Not sure if the 2x500 mg will do the job if I've been taking 3x 750 mg and insulin on top of that.... will try and see (I suppose I have to)Is he right that 750mg 3 times a day exceeded the max recommended dosage
