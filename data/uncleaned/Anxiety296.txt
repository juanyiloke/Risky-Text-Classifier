Happy EndingMy dad's sister has had dementia for several years and has been in a home. Her husband died several years earlier.She has very few coherent moments and lost her hearing. A few days ago she passed away. The day before she died one of her carers asked her why she was so dressed up, she looked like she was ready to go out somewhere special.She said she was off to meet her husband and asked her to take care of her cat that lived with her at the care home. She died that night.Apparently her last day was a very coherent one for her. It's nice to know she's finally at peace and even more heartwarming that she seemingly knew she was going to pass away.Ed
