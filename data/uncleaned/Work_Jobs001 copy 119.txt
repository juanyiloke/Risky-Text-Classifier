my holiday is not aproved and Im feeling discriminated________________________________________I need your adviceI work in a busy hotel,having around 300 rooms as a night manager.Im there since nearly 7 years. For the first 4 years Ive had no problem with taking my holidays during August (reason for that is my wife's' organization closes doors every year for first 2 weeks of August and she has no choice but to take annual leave). There was a rule first come first served. Since two years we have a new management and they have banned any holidays in August explaining that this is the most busiest time of the year. Problem is that actually this is not the busiest time as level of occupancy vary between 85-95% from March till November with top season month being May June July August September and October,yet people are allowed to take holidays either month but August, second there is 1 person who actually enjoy 5 days of holidays in August so I have an impression that double standards are applied! Please tell me what should I do in that case?
