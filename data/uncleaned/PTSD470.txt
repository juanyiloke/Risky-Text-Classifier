ÊDoes this sound like PTSD?I am aware that nobody here can diagnose me, but I am looking for some guidance. I was severely bullied when I was younger, both physically and emotionally. Kids said some very terrible things to me and I was also hit, choked, and thrown onto the floor. Even now, years later, I still have flashbacks, nightmares, and auditory hallucinations of things people said to me. I also suffer from social anxiety as well. At age 16, I dropped out of school because it was just too much for me to handle. I cannot work, go to school, or go out by myself because of the social anxiety and trauma. I talk to people online, but even that is difficult. I have discussed these things with mental health professionals, but none of them have even suggested I might have PTSD. Could the things I experience be PTSD and can severe bullying cause PTSD?ÊDST and hyper vigilanceI have found myself becoming more and more vigilant about people around me and what they are doing and heaven forbid anyone comes up behind me and touches me. I jump out of my skin and almost start to cry I am so scared.ÊIt has been really well controlled and I am still better than I used to be but I have had a big upswing in symptoms in the last month.ÊI am wondering if it could be related to daylight savings and the fact that there is more light.... like it is overly stimulating or something......Any thoughts?
