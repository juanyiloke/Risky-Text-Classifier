withdrawn and angryvery new to here so here goes i have very long story spanning almost 30 years and still find myself dwelling on issues from long ago along with feeling angry most of the time and sometimes just crying to myself for no real reason the smallest things that would not normally make somebody angry seem to anger me greatly also find it hard to be active on a social level and when i am i put on smiles like life is perfect im on medication to help this but the past 2 years have struggled greatly i feel like closing myself off at times the thought of being in a group of people will make me sick and ill often vomit as a result its affected every aspect of my life im feeling very lost what i can do now without anybody to turn to with so much having failed already how ever hard i try maybe others have had similar things or have advice thanks
