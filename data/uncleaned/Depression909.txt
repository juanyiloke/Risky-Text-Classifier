depression vs anxietyit seems that when i am not as severely depressed, my anxiety (GAD) gets worse and dominates. then when my anxiety's not so bad, the depression rages.that's what it's like right now; i am not too depressed (Thank god) but i am extremely, debilitatingly anxious. i will take anxiety over depression any day, but it still kinda sucks that either way, i have to suffer.anyone else get this? have you worked out how to find a balance?
