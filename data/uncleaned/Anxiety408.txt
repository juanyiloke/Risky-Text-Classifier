Have you had success with alternative medicines/supplements?Hi Friends,I was wondering if you were willing to share with me your experience with taking natural supplements (for anxiety or depress) as opposed to Rx drugs? I would appreciate hearing about it...I sometimes have success with L Theanine 200mg 2x a day...together with St Johns Wort... Also, at times, Bachs Rescue Remedy helps... I am allergic to any of the SSRI's I have tried... and all I take usually only once a day is .5 Ativan (Lorazepam) ... I am also starting on the Country Life "Good Mood" fish oil caps which I know have helped others... been on them for less than week.I'd like to hear about 'other' alternative things you do to help your anxiety... I seldom get Depression...it is almost a relief compared to Anxiety!   ...Anyway, thanks... hope you will share your experiences...if they work or not.
