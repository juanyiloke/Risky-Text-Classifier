Cults on Campus (Pgs: 1 2 3)by Paul126Please be warned that a Cult calling themselves The Freedom Church ARE TARGETING freshers . They seek vulnerable students away from home to join their cult. Whom plan global domination yes crazy but that is cults for you. They use the tactic love bombing the we are all happy routine to draw you in and young girls are a prime target to get the boys in. You will be invited to meetings but will end up paying to be indoctrinated by them and you will loose your friends etc . We lost a loved one from there contact at Swansea Uni and now all ties have been cut and they plan to marry.Please be warned and report them to the UNI. THEY ARE AFTER YOU AND YOUR MONEY THATS WHY THE DO NOT RECRUIT ON COUNCIL ESTATES AS PEOPLE WITH BENEFITS CAN NOT PAY BUT YOUNG VULNERABLE FRESHERS HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS. My posts have been removed in the past it seems they have a Freedom on campus but to warn you I do not.
