StrugglingI have been trying to recover from Anorexia for almost a year now... but have been relapsing a lot of times. I would plan and commit to myself that i would start eating whatever i want and can to gain some weight, but the next day once it's time to eat i would rather eat the same meal i had the previous day or just eat something less and end up regretting it and feeling shameful. I keep on telling myself that i would start a proper recovery the next day, but i just end up repeating my habits again...i don't know what to do. i'm in a region where eating disorder or anorexia treatments are not that reliable and i don't have a therapist or dietician..Please help T_T
