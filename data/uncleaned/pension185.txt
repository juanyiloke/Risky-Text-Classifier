Water RatesCheck your water bills, If you are being charged sewage check if  your roof water is going into a soak away which in most properties it is and not into the sewer  it is wrong for your water company to charge you if it goes into a soak away. I have just a few weeks ago found out that the 45 appts where we live had this charge added and we have all had our water accounts adjusted and had rebates against future bills.
