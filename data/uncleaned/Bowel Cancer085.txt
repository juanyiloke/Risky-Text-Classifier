Ups & downsSometimes I'm not sure how to cope with all the ups & downs this disease has thrown at me over the months.Well I say the disease, or is the medics? After 10 months of misdiagnosis, telling them I had a family history of cancer & being fobbed off as a 40-something female hypercondriac too young to have bowel cancer, they aren't my favourite people.So recently after being given the news (peritoneal mets..... last treatment they have.... no chemotherapy..... 50% chance of what I am having doing any good....should this fail, months left...get your bucket list together....GP/hospice/Mac nurse couldn't sign my DS1500 fast enough) I see the onc who tells me to go back to work as I'm being treated to have a 'normal life', I need to hold up my end of the bargain & live one.My brain, or at least the emotional centres of it, must look like a punch bag to them.Are they trying to wean me off my trips to Oncology & getting me ready for the day they tell me not to come back?Even my counsellor couldn't understand what this latest advice was aiming at.I've spent the last few days preparing my resignation letter & thinking of things to fill up my remaining weeks... >  R
