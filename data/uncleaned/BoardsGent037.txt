Are Irish men too subservient? - See Mod warning in post 52A thread in PI got me thinking. Are Irish men too subservient? I have friends from Spain, Italy, Latvia, Croatia, Hungary etc. and they all appear to be much more dominant when it comes to how they treat their girlfriends, wives and partners. Indeed some of them have even said to me that they feel Irish men are too subservient (they even extend this to British men also). Perhaps it is a cultural thing? Having dated both Irish and foreign (Spanish and Czech) women, the foreign GFs all had the same opinion. They also said that they preferred me to most Irish men because I knew how to "treat them like a woman" and didn't give in to everything they wanted.Some examples I have seen are as follows;Croatian friend "I would never allow my GF to hang around with her ex BFs, it is bad news!" (said relating to a friend whose Irish GF continues to be good friends with her ex)Spanish friend "Why are you cooking and cleaning all of the time" (Said in relation to a friend who does all of the house work)Ex GF (Czech), "I generally don't find Irish guys attractive, they spend too much time trying to please their GF and don't lead them. For example, the girls at work expect engagement rings to the value of Û5k+ and they say that their BFs would buy them no problem!"Of course this is a mass generalisation, but it appears that Irish men are a bit more subservient that European counterparts from what I have seen!
