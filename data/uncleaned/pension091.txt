Glad I'm nnot at school nowadays...2 items of news around this morning.......1) a noticeable increase in the number of school teachers buying stab proof vests...2) a noticeable increase in the amounts being paid out to school children who are injured in playground accidents , some of them being REALLY serious , like slipping on wet leaves , or falling off benches .......................just a tiny bit different to the days when I was being educated ....my education also included things like looking after myself , and being careful.Ê
