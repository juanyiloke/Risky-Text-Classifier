Blood sugar monitor adviceHi. Can anyone recommend a good (inexpensive!) blood sugar monitor? I don't mind paying out for the monitor but need to make sure the strips aren't going to cost me a fortune!!I'm Type 2 & the gp says I don't need one as I might obsess over my levels & the first 3 months will be up & down anyway! I mean she may have a point with the obsessing thing but I feel that if I don't know now what causes my bloods to rise then it'll be harder in the long run. She's put me on the slow release metformin coz of my bad reaction to the other one & am seeing the diabetic nurse (who I think just deals with asthma & diabetes so should have more advice for me!)
