Happy Easter Folks - here is something which might just cheer you up a bit•	Happy Easter Everybody,•	I am not too sure where to put this post but hey ho this is my "home group" because I am a Breast Cancer patient so here goes:- •	If you live in the Hull area (or even if you don’t and fancy a short break)•	Here is something which might cheer you up if you would like treat yourselves •	As I received the most wonderful Christmas present anybody could have last Christmas (see below)•	I have organised a Charity Ball in Hull with a funds raised being a straight 3 way split for the following charitable causes:- •	The first charitable cause is:- •	MacMillan Cancer Support –•	I am a Cancer patient, I had a lumpectomy + Rads in the summer of 2013 and then at the end of last year had a major secondary Cancer scare which frankly scared the living daylights out of me •	Fortunately after lots of  tests my Consultant phoned me on 23rd December 2014 wishing me Happy Christmas, he hoped everything I wished for came true in 2015 and to tell me that all the tests he’d done showed “nothing to cause concern” so my Cancer Care Plan put in place in 2013 would continue as normal.  •	If it wasn’t for MacMillan and all the wonderful people here when I was going through the tests last year I would have given up – I was in a very dark place and owe MacMillan an awful lot for all their support and encouragement. •	The second charitable cause is:- •	The Special Care Baby Unit at Scarborough General Hospital•	My daughter is a specialist Neo Natal Nurse / Ward Sister on this Unit.  She is always saying every penny counts and any donation given is gratefully received to help buy new equipment and Parent/Family facilities •	The third charitable cause is:- •	The Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit at Hull Royal Infirmary•	My daughter did part of her specialist Neo Natal training here and also some of the more tinier fragile/ill patients from Scarborough are transferred to Hull •	The evening is a full Black Tie / Ball Gown event•	Champagne Reception•	Three course meal•	A Fashion Show by The House of Fraser Hull•	A Full Cabaret Show•	And dancing •	It is a “Keep Music Live” event with no DJ or backing tracks – all music and any accompaniment to artists will be provided by the band. •	There will be raffle and auction •	Tickets are £60 or £550 for a table for 10 •	The hotel has given a discount rate of £60 for double or twin room plus breakfast for ball guests •	For more details please go to www.mariankingcharitytrust.com or send me a message if you would like to buy tickets.•	Big hugs and love to everybody, Valerie xxxx•	ps note to web site manager if this is in the wrong place please move it where it should go thankyou x
