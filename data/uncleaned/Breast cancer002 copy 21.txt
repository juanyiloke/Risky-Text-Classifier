NHS/McMillan have treated me so badly I am refusing further treatment.¥	Found a lump early Feb. Went to Dr. Booked into hospital dept within 2 weeks. And after tests including mri, was told it was cancer grade 3 and I should have surgery.  During McMillan conversation after I was told that lymphoma could be a problem. I didn't want that, so against my better judgement i agreed to a sentinel node biopsy, after being told the risk there was negligible¥	After that I asked if there were any leaflets for me this time. She said not.¥	However immedeatly after the op some McMillan's came and showednme some booklets. They said, you'll have seen these already, but well just go through the main points with you.¥	I had never been shown them and therefore did not know that the quality of every part of my life would be destroyed by the removal of the sentinel node.¥	The hospital were unhelpful and the staff deliberately rude, obstructive and unsympathetic. they attempted to get me sectioned because I said I would make a complaint.¥	I will never return to that hospital, not even to follow up the op. Their clear dislike of me makes it obvious that grudges would be used to make me suffer. Nor can I go to my gp as they will take the hospitals part against mine, and I will never trust a MacMillan nurse. They do not help you, they have not helped me in any way that was useful, and some that has been harmful.¥	I will be on the internet as much as I can putting my story on every UK cancer site. We are told we can trust McMillan, but they destroyed and betrayed my trust.
