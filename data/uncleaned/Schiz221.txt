Today I had a positive change. One of the worst delusions I've had, was that I was not delusional. I've struggled and suffered from this inner fight within my self surrounding my delusional thinking pattern for a long time. For many years I've been so headstrong on these religious delusions/beliefs, and would try to find the answer to the problem with thoughts that were apart of this delusional thinking pattern. today I feel as if I have taken a big step in moving forward with my life. I decided to accept the fact that I have a thought disorder, which in the past seemed so hard to do, and felt like if I where to try to disbelieve in the delusions, I couldn't and would be dragged back into these delusions. Now with a different perspective about the voices I'm having, I feel a lot better. I think I was able to finally accept the thought/beliefs (delusions) as delusional and as a thought disorder by simply, thinking simplistic about my situation in life. I hope I continue on into this recovery. I've also come to terms to forgive myself, and have found a new appreciation for those who have helped me through these difficult times. I am positive moving forward. Have a great day friends, and take it easy.
