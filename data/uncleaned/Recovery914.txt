:)"I was thinking today, that we’re all going to die one day. And I was thinking of all the things that I take for granted and sometimes I forget how blessed I am. And I just wanted to say that if you’re ever feeling down, You should really take a moment out of your day to think of everything that you cherish. Go squeeze someone you love, put your heart and soul into that hug and don’t let go until you both can’t breathe. Go make a friend with someone completely random, hold the door open for someone and if they don’t even acknowledge you, just smile! Never stop smiling, if you’re ever feeling lost take a chance, if you’ve got nowhere to go a new road will get you there. Dance and sing like no one’s watching, if you like someone, tell them! Laugh at the stupid jokes only you and your best friend find funny, laugh until your stomach hurts, and if you’ve ever been mean to anyone and never got the chance to say sorry, apologise! Life’s too short to waste your time being a jerk and if people are mean to you for no reason, screw them! Be yourself, because nobody else can be you, and if you want to cry, cry. Let it out, expectation is to reel all heart ache, the best thing to do is to stop thinking and to just let things happen and if the world ever makes you feel small, look up at the stars and know that someone somewhere is doing the same thing and just because today may have been a terrible day, doesn’t mean tomorrow won't be the best day of your entire life, you just have to wake up and get there! We learn from experience that we never really learn anything from experience, you never know what’s going to happen! And that’s the thing about life, you just have to breathe in every moment like it’s your last and never look back and never regret and always stay happy."
