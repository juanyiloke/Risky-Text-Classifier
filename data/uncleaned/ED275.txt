ÊTrappedI'm so trapped in this vicious cycle of recovery and relapse. I am struggling so much. I am triggered so easily and it makes me regret recovering. I don't know what I want any more. I'm going to uni on the 27th and a part of me feels this is so good because I will be without supervision and I will be able to do my own thing. I don't even feel that it is wrong to want to be back where I was a year ago, I miss it so much. I had no problems, no worries, very little emotion and attachment and all I could think about was weight. I miss it all so so much, I just want it back. I am so fat now and I am so unhappy. That's the first thing people will think about me when they see me, hence why I rarely go out. The first thing they will see are my huge thighs and chubby face. It's disgusting and I just can't live with it. This isn't a case of eating healthily ad exercising, it's an illness and it's destroying my life.
