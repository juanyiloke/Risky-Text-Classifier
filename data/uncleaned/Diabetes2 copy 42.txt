I am a 50 yo guy, and I have had T2 diabetes since 2007. I am now becoming desperate to make a friend so we can share our problems together. Please fe   As I mentioned above, I have begun to feel that diabetes is becoming a very lonely place for me, and I think that there will be a fair amount of people who could be of the same opinion. I am based in Manchester, and there is absolutely nothing more that I want right now than a nice, warm and understanding type of person (like myself - hopefully lol) to become my friend, and for us to hopefully meet up and share our problems and worries for the future together. Having friends has never been a problem for me, but as you may understand, it is very difficult for a non - diabetic person to understand our rapid ups and downs that are associated with this condition.
