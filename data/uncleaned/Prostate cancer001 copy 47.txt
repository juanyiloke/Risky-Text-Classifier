I'm not a Psa geek but need reassurance Just got my latest result prior to Onco visit on Tuesday 7th April.0.32Yes I should be jumping for joy as it's so low but it's gone up from 0.15 in January and 0.14 three months previouslyI've had RT & HDR brachy in Aug 2013 so RT still working and I'm on HT still.What's next? Am I on a slippery slope? Or is this the Psa "bounce"? Not sure what sort of questions to ask my Onco so would appreciate any advice or share similar experiencesThanks for reading.Alan
