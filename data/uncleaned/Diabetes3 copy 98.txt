KnickersNow that I have your attention, I would like to tell you about a product I have just bought. I bought some pants/knickers, made from cotton, for adults and children, with pockets in them to carry insulin pump or pens. They are a bit pricey but I feel that they are well worth the price. I went out on Saturday night without the worry of where to keep my pump, under a long dress. I was so pleased, I have bought 2 more pairs. The firm also sell tops. The name of the firm is annaps.
