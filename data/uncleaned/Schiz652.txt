ÊAcute psychosis event and aftermathHello guys, I'm new in the forum and I want explain my situation now after one year and half of my acute psychosis event. I had my first episode of psychosis during the second year of university I studied engineering the stress was very high for the exams and many others things. After this episode I went to the hospital for 4 weeks to recover of the break. Now after a year and half I'm good but I have yet some bad simptoms the worst is that I feel something that don't work with the vision. I feel myself stunned and this effect ends in the visual. There is something that can I do for this simptom?
