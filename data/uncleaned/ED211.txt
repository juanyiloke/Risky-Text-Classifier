 Binging and lyingHello all: New guy here on the forum. I hope I can meet some wise people to comment and offer a different perspective on my experiences and also maybe be able to offer a wise word or two for someone else. That's the plan anyway So to the topic of binging and lying. My wife is a wonderful person who makes my life better simply by being there. She is truly the love of my life and is always 100 percent helpful in trying to support me in any way as I work towards conquering BED.To that end, she's offered to make healthy meals for me to take to work (I work evenings, usually 3-to-11ish). I should also mention at this point that she is on disability and has PTSD, so she has to work even harder at the basics than a "normal" person would. But when I am at my worst, I will literally throw her hard work in the trash, beg a co-worker to borrow $5 and binge at the candy machine. And then when she asks me how I liked the dinner, I'll say "oh great, you really did a good job on that bean and pasta medley."I hate myself for binging and I hate myself just as much (if not more) for lying. But sometimes I literally can't stop.Has anyone else every dealt with this problem as it regards the feelings of a significant other? I'm a smart guy and know that what I'm doing is crap. But once that binge switch gets flipped, I could do or say almost anything to get my food fix.Thanks for helping.
