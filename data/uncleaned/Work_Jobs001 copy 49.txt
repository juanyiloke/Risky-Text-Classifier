What would happen if I stopped doing work I'm not paid to do.________________________________________Hey all,So I'm working in a bar and over the past year lots has changed. Our manager was sacked, our replacement manager has moved to another site and I've been left with everything to do. Our manager replacement is area manager and chips in when he can but I do absolutely everything, rotas, payrolls, orders, invoicing, bookings, customer complaints, staff requests, everything. Everyone goes to me and I sign off on everything. I'm still, technically a Front of House supervisor and nothing more.I don't mind the work and I got a little raise before Christmas, but to be fair, so did everyone. Our bar is tiny but is hugely popular (top 10 in UK, top 10 in the world of another magazine or two) averaging 80 booking requests a day, don't get me started on the Christmas rush which I single handedly managed without any complaints.The head office is hugely incompetent. I refuse to get dragged into a salary negotiation as they always offer insulting offers and don't budge on them. If I broke down the salary they've offered to other members on different sites, I would be paid considerably less than I am now considering the hours I work. I will stick to been paid hourly due to the hours I clock a week (50-60+). What I'm asking for is pittance considering, not just my workload, but what I am actually achieving, complete management of one of the most popular bars in the British Isles (no joke).I have formally asked my area manager (who is on my side) for an hourly pay rise. It is really about principle really. I have recently qualified in another field which I hope to be joining very soon and leaving the bar but not for another 2 months or so.If they say no, I would like to just stop what I'm doing and do what I'm contracted to do, Front of House Supervisor, nothing more. No orders (we're a craft beer bar and I'm the only one who knows anything about it and all the suppliers/breweries deal with me personally), no bookings (80 emails a day, unanswered), no payrolls, no invoicing, nothing. Any question that comes to me I will direct to a manager...which there isn't any.Can they do anything to me for this? If they do, can that be seen as constructive dismissal? I mean, I'm doing someone else's job and getting no recognition for it, paid or otherwise. I aimed to be out of this job a long time ago, however these things happen but as I said my new qualification has given me a path out. I don't want to be a d’ck but I'm just sick of them using me.
