I've been let go(NEED ADVICE)________________________________________So I'm in need of a bit of help! I was working part time in a company( I will not state the name). I've been there since before christmas, I was coming up on being there 6 months! The job is a sales based job and I was hitting targets every month! So I was due to be in work from 12-6pm on Sunday the 3rd may, I was expecting it to be just another weekend of working! Then on 2pm Saturday I got a phone call from my manager saying that the shop was doing bad and that he had no more hours to give me and that I was being let go! I was really quite offended that he couldn't even say it to my face. When I went to talk to him on the phone he hung up and that was that! On the Sunday I sent an email asking for my P45 and a written reason saying why I had been let go, he than began to hassle me about giving the shop keys back and that I would not get my information until I gave my keys back! I told him that I was currently busy with college exams and that I was unsure when I would have the time to give the keys bac and told him it was vital I got that information, he continued to hassle me about the keys and avoided every question I asked!It doesn't bother me that I was let go, what does bother me though is the fact that there was a new part-time girl there only 3 weeks and she was kept on! My sales were good, I was getting good customer reviews, and let them know I was finishing college and would be available to work anytime and anywhereA month before this my old manager and colleague were fired and this is when this new manager took over, ever since the guy just seemed to dislike me! I'm guessing his aim was to get all the original staff out of the store!I'm going to send the keys back to head office through registered post on Tuesday as I do not feel comfortable going in to give him the keys!( he has an awful attitude towards staff and customers)So I need some advice and want to ask some questions;1.I'm owed pay for days worked in the week, will I also be owed holiday pay?2.was it right of him to ring me and let me go over the phone or should it have been done better?3.is that short phone conversation sufficient notice?4.how does the notice period work?5.is there anything I can do about this? I know unfair dismissal is out of the question as I wasn't there a yearHope someone can help me and advice me on what to do!Thanks
