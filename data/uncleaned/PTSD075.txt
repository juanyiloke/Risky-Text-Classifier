Triggered By My BodyA pain psychologist that I met with recently seemed to sum everything up for me in saying, "You're triggered by your body."WHOA. yeah.We weren't talking trauma details. She knew I was working with a trauma therapist, she knew my list of medical issues and major symptoms (anorexia, panic, chronic pain), and we talked about the pain a little. But just hearing in phrased that way felt like a major "duh" and also reaffirmed the somatic stuff I'm working on.I don't feel like I have a massive list of triggers (not that it's totally clear)...certain people creep me out for no clear reason, I avoid close relationships, and I avoid open spaces if I can...this isn't hard to do, so it doesn't feel like a big deal. I'm triggered by certain kinds of touch, certain people, and chaotic or overly unpredictable environments. I'm a good avoider. But mostly it's been my whole body, which I can't get away from without self-destructing. I've been numb for a long time and also experienced my "self" as existing in a space just a bit outside of my body (this has gotten a little better). In the past couple years the majority of symptoms related to internal sensations, which I used to not feel at all...now I'm working with moving from overwhelm to tolerance. I can't get away from my body, so the somatic therapy approach has been helpful for learning how to live in it better. Mindful movement and daily walks help too.Does anyone else relate to being triggered by their own body? What has helped your recovery in this area?
