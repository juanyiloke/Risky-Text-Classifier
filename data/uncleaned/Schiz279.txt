I feel outcast with this illness because nothing rational ever comes naturally to mind! If people even knew the extent of crazy that goes on within. Getting along with others at the best of times means disguising how wild my mind is... a break from the torture but a false impression. This is how I feel when I'm down about it all.I attempted to make new friends but realised I don't really fit in, especially in church! It set off paranoia that people can hear God speak. Now I believe but feel fear.Oh, life's too short to be burdened with this illness...
