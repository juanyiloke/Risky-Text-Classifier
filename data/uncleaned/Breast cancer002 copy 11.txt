waiting for oncotype-dx resultshello everyone .. let me introduce myself . I am a 55 year old grandma diagnosed in February with invasive ductal carcinoma .. opted for a wle and sentinel node biopsy . recovered from surgery but after receiving news that the 25mm tumour was stage 2 grade 3 bvut clear margins and no node involvement have had the oncotype dx test done .. am now waiting for those results, things seem to be going so slowly now after the initial rush and I am getting very frustrated waiting for results.. Am on letrozole for the meantime .. and back to hot flushes . I thought I was finished with these, lol x vast mood swings affecting me also , find I can cry at the drop of a hat !My wounds have healed quite well , though I still get the spasm pain in the breast sporadically . I think I will find this site a great comfort and look forward to getting to know everyone better and swapping experiences and thoughts .
