Asthma and Diving  2  My son is nearly 19, weighs about 65kg and is 5'11'' - he has probably less than 10% body fat and is very fit and active. He does an enormas amount of excersize at Krav Maga and 5-a-side each week with no issues. He has been diagnosed with Asthma since he was very little and until last week was taking two puffs morning and night of the combination inhaler with 50/25. He only ever suffers any tightness or weezing if he's around horses or bad pollen. His Peak flow has never been better than 400. We went for a Diving medical last week and the Doctor said he could not dive as his peak flow and spirometry were below average so he put himn on 5 days of 30mg oral steriod and upped his puffer to 250/25 twice a day. He has finished the course and been taking teh increased puffer for 7 days with NO CHANGE to his peak flow?
