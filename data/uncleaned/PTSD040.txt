Is It Possible To Have Ptsd From Being Cheated On?My fiance cheated on me 3 years ago over the course of 8 months and since then I feel like my whole life just got turned upside down. (I won't bore you with the novel length story.) I thought that maybe time would make things easier to get over because that's what just about everyone has told me...but it just doesn't seem to be happening. If anything it's been getting worse. I have frequent nightmares about him and the other woman to the point where I started to have trouble sleeping. Anytime I hear her name or see anyone who looks like her I start to have trouble breathing and most of the time burst into tears. I haven't been to the mall in almost a year since I heard she started working there. I tried going a few times but as soon as I would I'd start feeling dizzy and like I was about to be sick. It's the same way I feel during the two holidays that I know they slept together on, like I'm about to be physically ill. I have moments where I feel back to normal and happy, but the second I see or hear something that reminds me of seeing the two of them together it's almost like I can't stop reliving what happened over and over until somehow it gets out of my head on its own through some sort of distraction. It's been 3 years and I feel like I should be over it by now. I finally told a close friend about how bad it's gotten and she suggested that it might be PTSD. I'd never heard of ptsd being caused by something like my situation so I really wasn't sure whether to take her seriously or not.
