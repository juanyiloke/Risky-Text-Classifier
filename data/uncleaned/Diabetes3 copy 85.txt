Need some encouragement!Hi All I feel I've let things slip a bit lately and can't seem to find the motivation I had  I'm still doing the basics right but generally arnt as careful as I was and each day I'm finding temptation harder to avoid. Yesterday we went out for tea and I even ate a few chips plus a dessert. In the same way I had got into the good habit of not resisting I seem to be sliding the other way at the moment and know it's got to stop. The 'reasons' I can come up with are generally not feeling great with possible arthritis and trying tablets which make me feel nauseous, Easter coming up with chocolate tempting me everywhere, tiredness from still doing more hours at work (I enjoy it and know it's supposed to ease off soon when new staff start) Just writing this has given me a push - none of them mean I'm being force fed carbs! Good to get it off my chest
