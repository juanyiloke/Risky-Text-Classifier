Fostair question Let's see if this works!!I was changed to Fostair a few days ago which i understand is a combination steroid preventer and a long-acting reliever. I also have my salbutamol reliever for as and when needed. I did a 10k this morning so as a result i'm still coughing. I can feel the reliever part of the Fostair working when i take it cos i get slighlt shakes and i was wondering if it's getting close to bedtime, within an hour or two and i'm feeling like i need my reliever is it worth taking the bedtime Fostair dose rather than the salbutamol or should i just take the salbutamol then get the other reliever bit a short time later?
