Do I have Complex PTSD?by dkvk » Tue Apr 01, 2014 8:58 pmHi, I have had a prolonged traumatic stress for 2 and a half years. I have searched online and I think the symptoms fit me. However, my symptoms also fit that of depression.I get really irritated, sad, moody, obsessed whenever I think of the traumatic experience and then cannot get it out of my head for days. Other days (very few) when I don't have these thoughts, I am fine. I hate it when the thoughts invades my mind  Do you think I have C-PTSD in this case and not depression? Also, is Complex PTSD something that can be diagnosed officially? If I go to GP (I am in UK) will there be some kind of treatment to hep me overcome it?
