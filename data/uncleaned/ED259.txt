ÊNew to this & need helpHi,So, um, I'm new to posting on this kind of thing but I've had an eating disorder for over 6 years.ÊIt fluctuates. At first I restricted everything and exercised like crazy. Lost weight and then managed to hold myself there through periods of not eating/eating normal.ÊI then gained weight and lost it again a little more healthily, and then I got scared when it reached the same time of year I gained the weight last time (Christmas) To control my weigh I started to binge and purge. I turned to bulimia for about 10 months, but since have confessed to my boyfriend because I thought it was the only way I could stop because stopping for myself wasn't enough.ÊIt worked. I did stop, albeit not straight away, but I still can't stop the binging fully.And now I'm gaining weight and terrified I will revert back to purging.ÊI'm just so sick of thinking about food all the time and I just want to be normal. There's a lot of hatred inside of me because I think of the little girl I used to be and get so mad at myself for the person I've become because she doesn't deserve it; I don't deserve it.ÊI guess I just want some support really. I feel like I can't go to my doctor about it because he's all too close to my family and it's a small town where I'm originally from.I know it's not going to be a case of waving a magic wand but I just want to feel less alone because right now, I feel like I'm going crazy.ÊDoes anyone have any tips of stopping binge eating? I could really do with a few of those right now.ÊThanks,ÊLindsey.Ê
