Husband going to therapy with you?I'm honest with my husband about when I b/p, but I don't feel comfortable getting into the nitty gritty like I would with a therapist. He keeps pushing for us to go to therapy together because I think at times he feels lost on how to best support me, but the whole idea makes me so uncomfortable.I moved post getting married and left my support network, including my therapist. It's been really hard, and I've relapsed. I know I need to get back into therapy, and I have tried really hard in the new state. However, I haven't been able to find anyone I like and it's hard finding anyone in general based on scheduling/insurance. And the big kicker - having to rebuild a relationship with a therapist like I had before is so daunting because we move every 2 years. Recapping your not so rosy life history to someone new every couple of years is about as fun as a root canal. Adding in him to the dynamic of trying to find a therapist I like is frustrating. He just doesn't get how hard it is to actually find someone to talk to. He thinks you just call up any old therapist, they can see you that week, and everything will click. Unfortunately, that's not how it works.I wouldn't be opposed to it if I were still seeing my old therapist who knew my history, triggers, personality, ect. But a new one? Oy vey.Does anyone have any experience with bringing your husband to therapy? What did you think? Was it helpful? Did you both get something positive out of it?
