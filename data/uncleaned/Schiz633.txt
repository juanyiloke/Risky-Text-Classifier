ÊDo you ever feel a presence?

Hello! I'm new here. I am bipolar with comorbid anxiety, social phobia, derealisation, and ocd. I have reoccurring psychosis and have since I was 17. We're not yet certain if I have bipolar with psychotic features or schizoaffective or what. I've been having a lot of psychotic activity lately and I've noticed I FEEL people who aren't there. Like ghostly presences. I felt six people in my dining room, and two people in my bedroom. I feel people following me outside, watching me. It's a strong, powerful feeling. This has been happening a lot. I'm going to have to talk to my psychiatrist about it when he gets back from his leave in June because it can be pretty scary.Ê

So my question is this: do you ever feel a ghostly presence, especially when psychotic? Do you think that this is a psychotic symptom?

Thanks for answering!
