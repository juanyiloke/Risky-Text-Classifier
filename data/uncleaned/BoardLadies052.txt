Having your own stash of condoms?I was curious how common this was, I was lurking on the price of contraceptive thread here and mentioned it to a friend. She said that she never has her own contraceptives  I always have condoms (partially because I can only use a limited amount of brands  ) but I think its just being responsible for your own sexual health.Do you ladies have your own condom stashes, or really any contraceptive that isn't medically inserted?
