Did you pursue your childhood dream?2012-04-29, 06:53 PMWhether it was being a professional sports player, a doctor, a lawyer or whatever it may of been, it doesn't matter how silly it sounds. Did you pursue it? Why or why not? Are you still pursuing it? How old were you when you pursued it and/or stopped pursuing it?I never got to pursue mine due to cost alone. I've always wanted to make it as a race car driver, laugh if you want, I know it sounds ridiculous but that's my "dream." Anyways, I'm out of college now and have what I'd consider an "ok" income from a job that I certainly enjoy but it's not my dream. So I've been paying down my college bills, car loan, ect and thinking about pursuing my dream now that I'm 26 years old.ÊI know it will be a mountain to climb at this point, but it certainly wouldn't be impossible and I'd at least be doing something I love even if it only ends up being an extremely expensive hobby.
