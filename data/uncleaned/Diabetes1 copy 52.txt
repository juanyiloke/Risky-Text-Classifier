Best / least painful lancing device?The lancing device that comes with my blood glucose meter (Freestyle Lite) really hurts! I tried adjusting it, but it still really hurts! I'm sure you don't have to use the lancing device that comes with your meter kit; it's not like test strips! Does anyone know of a good lancing device that doesn't hurt so much? And, is it even the lancing device that hurts, or is it the lancets, themselves? In which case, can someone please recommend lancets that don't hurt? Oh, and one I can test somewhere other than my fingers. I don't want anyone seeing evidence I'm a diabetic at work, yet! Thanks.
