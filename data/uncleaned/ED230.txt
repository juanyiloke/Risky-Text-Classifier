ÊIs it my Ed and anxiety thats making me feel hurt by my friend?I have an ed which I spoke to a friend about for the first time a couple of years ago. Its been on and off for many years now. We used to work together and became good friends i had never really spoken about it to anyone before and felt that i couldnt. But she was really showing she cared and wanted to help so i opened up. She came to a couple of appts with me and we talk about it was finding it hard but still did as it was some relief. A while later i found out it had slipped out at work and she had told her husband and mum and dad. I then closed up said things were getting better and made a point of not bringing it up when we were together. We are still friends but the subject gets danced around now and the friendship doesnt feel the same even tho we both betend it it ! The thing is i left the job to travel for a bit when i got back she asked if i wanted to come back I said yes as we are still friends and i enjoyed the job. But now there are different people there and our friendship has turned weird i hardly hear from her outside of work now. I have a boyfriend now which i didnt before and i know i still have in the back of my mind will she say anything about my ed to her new friends at work. So i mostly only talk a bout work stuff to her at work not home stuff am I worrying about nothing? Or maybe shes picked up on the fact i m keeping things more personal to myself? Just not sure why i dont hear from her outside of much now? Or is it just my ed working overtime?
