Asthma fear and symptomsPosted about a month agoI would like to apologise in advance if this sounds stupid but I can't help the way I think.I've been diagnosed with having anxiety and also asthma. However, I'm not 100% convinced it's asthma but feel it's anxiety.I was prescribed both the blue and brown inhalers to use but have yet to use these, partly due to not knowing if it is asthma.Could someone please tell me:What symptoms you get with your asthma? Also how do you know when you're having an attack and what do you do to relieve it before seeking help?I seriously wish my mind didn't over think things but I can't help it.I just feel I need reassuring.
