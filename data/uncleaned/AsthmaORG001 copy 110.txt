Just been diagnosed and feeling quite daunted and a bit confused! Hi - I've just been diagnosed as having adult onset asthma at the tender age of 51 but all the items I've read refer to tight chest and wheezing. I just have breathlessness as if I've run upstairs, just doing everyday things like emptying the dishwasher or feeding the cat. My tight never feels tight and although I'm out of breath, I never have the feeling that I can't breathe - does that makes sense? I find it all very daunting at the moment and was wondering if the feeling of being out of breath is actually asthma. I've had my heart tested and that's fine. I'd be grateful for any comments - thanks
