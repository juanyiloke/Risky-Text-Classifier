Cheated-take them back or it's over for good?Personally I do not think I would take them back... For me it would not actually be about the cheating, well a bit obviously but it would be more to do with how could I trust him again with anything... I don't think I would ever get past the betrayal of trust.I know some people get back and sometimes stay together and it works out but for me I just don't know. Thankfully I have never yet to make that decision but it could easily happen I guess just hope it never does!
