ÊIssues with Hunger and underweight but not anorexiaHello,ÊI am writing here in the hope of finding some answers.My problem is that I hardly ever feel hungry, to the point I can be comfortable not eating for 3 days, or eating so little.I looked up anorexia, but I dot have a fear of gaining weight, actually, I don't like it how I look when I loose too much weight, I look sick.I like eating healthy stuff and I don't have any pain when eating, which is the other scenario I found for lack of hunger.I am on my 40s, right night struggling to stay at an underweight weight.I can force my self to eat, which I do often, but it is really so ugly to eat when you are not hungry. sometimes I have to gulp each byte with water.THis problem have existed since I have memory and have caused me gastritis, loss of energy, and two hospitalization last one with a surgery. What happened is that I would remember to eat, butI would have an ice-cream for lunch, then nothing else until next morning, where I would have pancakes, then nothing until next day where I would have a banana... etc. Very erratic eating can make you very sick...I tried putting myself on a schedule and this is what works best, but still hate eating without hunger. I can be running errands or reading a book, lunch time comes and I find myself saying "Oh shoot I have to eat.."I am not under any significant stress, I have had worse for sure.ÊI get no compassion or understanding because I am not overweight so all I get is "oh, how I wish I had that problem"Any words of compassionate wisdom would be appreciated
