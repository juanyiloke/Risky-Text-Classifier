ÊAh, trying diet pills-- from the internet cause I hate myself and want to see about getting skinnier. I kind of hope they work or something. I'm also just gonna go low pretty much everything I think. I've cut out meat and now I want to cut out the bread and just eat like lettuce and a few peanuts. It seems like this will be the only way I can get lower since I've been stuck at my current weight. I have to cut everything out. A diet of sunshine and water.ÊI hate being me. I feel incredibly ugly and unlovable.
