Crying all the time is driving me nuts!!Hi all, I hope someone has an answer. I cry all the time and it is ruining everything for me. When ever i watch, hear or experience anything emotional, i start crying. I am a middle aged man and this is driving me nuts. I can't watch anything sad or happy on TV without starting to cry. It starts welling up and I try so hard to not cry. I make noises which scares me dog and when I am around my kids and grand kids, I make a lload sort of hissing sound when ever i get the crying urge. The kids know exactly whats going and and now ignore me.Has anyone else experienced this?ÊSteve
