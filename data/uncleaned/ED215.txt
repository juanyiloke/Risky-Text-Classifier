ÊWeekends are the end of mejust need somewhere to say it, as i'm to afraid to admit it.i was lonely over the weekend and went on a rollercoaster. bags of sweets and icecreams, unnecessary and unhealthy.i'm fine during the week, busy with work and such. come the weekend and nights in i'm bored and annihilating the cupboard. yes until my stomach hurts.i've been tellling myself this is 'the last time' for a long time. i think i do it because my epilepsy is so uncontrolled, and i can't deal with it. i really don't want to get counselling i was hoping if i open up to people here, i can overcome it.Êi live and eat alone. i do have a flat mate but she is out alot.
