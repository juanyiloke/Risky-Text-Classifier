I thought I was recovering but now..I feel like i have been lying to myself about being fully for recovery. I want to when I see my future being healthy and happy but honestly the thoughts of binging and restricting are constant lately. I have been trying to watch what I eat in order to loose some of the fat that I gained when I went back to eat normally. I know what weight I want to be at and I don't plan on loosing any more. But its becoming a challenge for me to be under myfitnesspal calorie intake or to work off more than I eat for the day. And now after a pretty good week I want to binge because I feel like I am mentally hungry if that makes sense. Mentally speaking I am strong enough to tell my eating disorder no, however, i feel like the thoughts of engaging is getting worse. I really don't know what to do because I know an eating disorder is bad. I just want to have a normal relationship with food.What are your guys ways to get rid of the thoughts? Do you distract yourself? I feel like the eating part isn't that hard but its the thoughts before and after that get to me
