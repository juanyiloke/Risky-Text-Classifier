The Working PoorI was truly shocked to watch the BBC programme last night which highlighted three working households, two with children, who struggle on very little money.Ê It seems quite impossible for these people to get ahead as although each of the five adults, two couples and one single man, had a job they also qualified for tax credits without which they could not manage, but if they increased their earning the clawback took a huge proportion of the extra money earned and it reminded me about colleagues in the nineties who could not accept overtime for fear of losing their benefits.One of the fathers was a Tesco Home Delivery driver.Ê One problem also seemed to be the zero hours contract where no work is guaranteed.Ê The saddest to me was the single man who worked in a fast food outlet and was on one of these contracts.Ê He could not afford food at the end of his two week interval between pay days and said that he saw others going for a drink in the pub or to a club, but it was out of his reach financially.Ê I have said before that I don't think people should be paid less than it is possible to live on and the government assists this by paying tax credits, which obviously cost the country a fortune with 3.3 million now in receipt of credits, but at least these people have employment with the benefits this brings in terms of self esteem, better mental health etc.Ê What do you think?
