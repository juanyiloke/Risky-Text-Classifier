ÊMy DelusionsSo, my delusion is that there are three different planes of existence. Reality as we know it, and two separate worlds that don't really seem to interact with each other. I can interact with all three of these planes. Jackson lives, trapped in the second plane. He's roughly collage age, with redish-brown hair, pale skin, dirty freckles and rough stubbly facial hair. He usually only wears a gray or black hoodie with some jeans and is usually fiddling with something, like a pocketknife or lighter. He has a fascination with cars andI used to have two more people trapped in that plane, named Margret and Rochelle. Margret was an older woman with crazy curly hair who was very sweet and caring. She liked birds and often called me by pet names such as sugar/honey bear, sweetheart, darling, etc. I don't remember very much about Rochelle, but she was about sixteen years old and cursed a lot. She was rather forceful, but she usually tried to help me. I haven't heard from Rochelle in, who knows how long. Quite a while. And Margret has been missing for a few months. The last time Jackson went on a rant he claimed to have killed her, and so I can only assume that he also killed Rochelle, but he always refuses to talk about her. The third plane is just random conversations which sometimes includes me, sometimes not. Never the same voice, and just constantly going. Always someone talking about something. But, nothing about my psychosis really affects me, except for Jackson. Sometimes when I'm weak, he's able to pretty much take over me. And the last time he did that
