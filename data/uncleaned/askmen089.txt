Personality Conflict with Supervisor2012-10-28, 08:02 PMSorry to post so many issues but I have a very stressful position at the moment and I need all the advice I can get. My department is expanding so my company hired a "team leader" to assist us so our primary supervisor can get some more work done. Actually our supervisor hired the new team leader. She was an internal applicant and before she even applied to the position; our department had heard negative things about her. Unfortunately, it's only been two weeks and those rumours seem to be true. She is rude, and I feel like I can't ask questions which is a problem because I've been chose to learn new material. I'm not the only person who feels this way-- I've spoken about her with other employees and they feel that her attitue is a bit rude and condescending as well and it's only been two weeks!!ÊI liked my job before even though it was stressful and I did get along with my primary supervisor- very well. But this new team leader, is supposed to act as our supervisor so our manager can be left alone. Is my only option transferring departments? I know my manager has already heard the rumours about this girl before she became our new team leader but he hired her regardless. Something tells me he does not SEE her rude behavior or he does not care. Even though before, he made it clearly that any rudeness from ANYONE in the company woudl strictly not be tolerated.What can I do?
