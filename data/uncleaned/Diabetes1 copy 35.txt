No weight loss Phew...just read through the thread that is about 3 months old, the one about Trudi Deakins book. Noticed someone had said that people lose weight on a lchf diet.I've said over again I haven't lost 1 lb. Many folk have been helpful in their advice, about why it wont shift. I have about 2 st to lose. After a hysterectomy and then the menopause I put on weight and got diabetes. Being skinny all my life and then to get this and then to follow/research everything about the disease and still not lose weight. I'm jealous of peoples weight loss. All power to you. I've asked to see an endo - sorry no spare cash. I've had my thyroid tested - its fine. Fair enough I'm not that consistent with exercise, but with throwing a kettle bell about for half an hour a day and still seeing no weight moving it becomes exasperating.Anyway I've also said that I don't have a choice but to eat low carb, because it benefits my BS. Heyho have to carry on.P.S. I've also done a fat fast - guess what...This week I'm doing HIIT on a stationary bike. See if that makes any difference.
