Anxiety or Some other problem? Please helpOver the past few weeks I have been getting worst and I don't know what I have. I don't know if this even goes here but  I'll try to explain it as best I can and see if anyone has had something similar. I know when I first realized this coming on I had some stomach pain on the right side of my body under my abdomen. I was vomiting then at least 7 times in that week. Before that for at least a month I was feeling weak and tired all over my body, I always felt fatigued. I went to the ER and that said It might be gastridous or something.A week later I still had that feeling but I also started feeling numb on the right side of my body little by little as the next week went on. Also during that same week my head started feeling funny and I couldn't get any sleep because it felt like blood kept building up in my head when I lay down.  Still that same week my right arm kept going numb and my head had that tingling feeling.Fast forward to now my whole body almost feels numb i've been to the er twice since then but everything comes back normal. My feet feel wet but when I look at them they are dry.  Now as of last night and today my nose is bleeding.  I used to think it was because of anxiety but now I'm not so sure.  I was never diagoised with anxiety either, but I just thought thats what I had.  Now I'm not so sure of what this can even be.  If anyone can please help, I'll explain some more if I have to.
