Do I have asthma or EIB? (Just diagnosed but not sure)________________________________________I'm 33 years old and never had problems with allergies during childhood. My nose is always runny during cold months but that runs in the family. I'm fairly fit and have exercised more or less my whole life. Last August I started exercising more vigorously. I started to jog on treadmill regularly for the first time. I always hated running because I got tired very fast when I was a kid. This time I kept running and in one month finished a 7km run in 34 minutes, which was fairly good for someone at the age of 33 who never ran his whole life. I also upped my swimming and started to train 1.5 hours almost every day in the pool. I used to swim a lot when I was a kid but then later I did quit. So now I was swimming 3.5km's every day (not just swimming but doing swimming workouts for master swimmers), running once or twice a week for 4km's with a workout program I devised for myself and it was going quite well. My capacity seemed to be increasing steadily with both running and swimming. When I first started I ran at 9.5km/h for 6 minutes, then 11.5 for 5 minutes and than at 13 for 4 minutes. I upped that little by little and last month I was running 10.2 for 6 minutes, 12.2 for 5 minutes and 13.7 for 4 minutes whenever I ran on the treadmill. My heartrate also kept lowering for the same speed and even for my top speed. I could run at 10.2 with a heartrate of 135-140 and my max heartrate at 13.7 would be around high 160's or low 170's. Then a month ago, I got sick. It wasn't serious but I felt weak for 4-5 days, no fever or cough but just weakness. I stopped training obviously, and then waited a few days even after my symptoms were gone. But then when I went to the treadmill, to do the exact same workout, my heart had to work almost 10 bpm higher for all speeds. I was running at 10.2 with 150 BPM instead of 140, and at 13.7 my heart rate was 181.It seemed a little weird that 10 days of inactivity would lower my fitness by that much, after all even before I got sick I was running once a week anyway, but swimming every day.I didn't think much about it. But it didn't go away with subsequent tries. My heart rate was always much more elevated than before. And in the pool, I was getting tired faster as well. Then I noticed that my breathing was harder so I saw a pulmonologist. She did a spirometry and said that I may have asthma.She based this on a previous spirometry I had 2 years ago. 2 years ago my FVC was 6.94 and FEV1 was 5.53 (both much higher than predicted) and this time my FVC was 7.34 but FEV1 was still 5.53. So according to only these I seem to be doing even better, but the ratio is lower now, at 75%. She said that I can breathe in more air compared to 2 years ago but cannot exhale the same percentage in 1 second. So she gave me a long acting asthma medicine called Fostair and told me to stopswimming because the chlorine in the pools can cause temporary asthma. I started using two buffs every morning and every evening. It didn't seem to make any kind of difference but I think it may take up to a month for those drugs to fully take effect. So now that I cannot swim, I jumped on the treadmill couple days later to find out I cannot even finish my everyday workout now. My heartrate was way too high even in the lower speeds and I was out of breath. So in my next visit I told her that, and she prescribed me Ventolin to use before exercise.First time I tried Ventolin before exercise, I could run and breathe quite easily. Although my heart rate was still more elevated than a month before, I didn't feel fatigued or unable to catch my breath. I even ran an extra 3 km's at 10km/h after I finished my regular workout. The second time I tried Ventolin, it didn't work. I was out of breath during my run and stopped. The third time today, same. Now, when I run, my throat feels like narrowing so I cannot catch my breath. I don't feel any chest tightness or coughing, just my throat seems to narrow. I bought a peak flow meter which also measures FEV1 (although for 30$ I don't know how reliable it is), but today when I had to stop my run in the middle I immediately measured my peak flow and FEV1 and none of them had a drop compared to normal results. If I had EIB, shouldn't my peak flow and FEV1 get reduced especially when I feel like I cannot catch my breath during exercise? Now I start to think I may not have asthma to begin with.Is there anyone with similar history?
