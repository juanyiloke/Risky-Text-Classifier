Has Active Surveillance failed me? Hi, this is my first post and any advice would be helpful. I've been on A S since November 2010, after a routine PSA test showed 5 ish which was a bit too high. ( no symptoms other than slight incontinence when driving, lifting etc with a full bladder.) Referred to Urology, DRE revealed no abnormality, but TR biopsies ordered, 'to be on safe side'. Result - all clear, so just another PSA test. Unfortunately' PSA now 8, so more TR biopsies, which this time showed 2/12 cores positive, 3+3, cT0. Was offered Active Surveillance which I agreed to with an MRI scan which showed no abnormality.The next 4 years of 3 monthly blood tests showed PSA always between 6 and 8.4 and annual TR biopsies clear with no signs of malignancy. Urologist was confident there was no problem, and I still was symptomless. When the latest biopsies became due I asked if I could have an MRI instead (simply because it doesn't hurt as much.) Doc agreed, had the MRI and then I was called in for more TR biopsies because MRI showed major changes with 2010 scan.I was called in to discuss the results. Latest biopsies were clear, no signs of malignancy. Yet MRI indicated malignancy escaping the prostate capsule into seminal vesicle classified T3b. MDT meeting recommended radical prostatectomy preceded by pattern biopsies under general anaesthetic. I agreed, and was offered open surgery at FGH Barrow, keyhole surgery at Preston RI, or Robotic surgery at The Christie, Manchester. I've seen [name removed by Moderator] re Laparotic surgery. He says, No, a T3b tumour gives only 30% success with no recurrence with high risk of permanent urinary incontinence. so he recommends radiotherapy.I'm seeing [name removed by Moderator] at The Christie on Wednesday re robotic surgery. If he is confident, and offers it, what do I do?Thanks for reading,David.
