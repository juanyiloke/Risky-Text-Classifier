Has anyone here *ever* seen Somogyi?Hi folksJust wondering if anyone here who has ever had access to CGM or Libre sensors had ever actually witnessed a liver dump in reaction to a low BG overnight (the Somogyi effect).I spent several years wondering whether Somogyi explained some errant morning BGs I had seen during my time playing at being my own pancreas. Actually it put me in quite a quandary for a while when I woke up high, because (so the theory goes) that could either mean I had too much basal active overnight or too little...I remember speaking to a long-term CGM user who had always accepted Somogyi as a thing, until she used CGM and just never saw it. I've also spoken to consultants/Drs who say that when you look for it - you can't find it. And actually Diabetes UK got themselves into hot water with parents of children with T1 a few years back by suggesting that overnight lows might be 'sorted out' by the liver (I think it was on their website for a while).Now I certainly *have* seen what I consider to be liver dumps during the daytime including after extended low BG overnight, but these have only happened after I have woken up and started moving about and eaten something. Times where there is a rise in BG of an extent that simply cannot be accounted for by carb errors or whatever. I also know that people do see clear evidence of Dawn Phenomenon with CGM and can try to navigate around that.My most recent Libre sensor has really brought this into focus (partly because my BGs have been really playing up recently). If I drop below 4 in the early hours, even if only just after midnight I will just stay low all night until I wake up and do something about it. My livernever intervenes however low I go, or for however long.Just wondering if anyone here has ever seen an overnight low BG fixed automatically by the liver when using CGM/Libre?
