New memberHello - good to know this forum is here.I just tried to post some introductory info, but I guess I hit the wrong key and lost everything.I have just been advised by an oncologist (from Florida Cancer Specialists) that cancer is present in both lungs. She made this judgment from review of recent X-Ray, CAT and PET scan data. Biopsy has not yet been done - scheduled for about 10days from now (no point in complaining about the paper-work screw-ups that caused the delay).Pulmonologist who ordered the biopsy sees only a possible cancer in one lobe.Question: Am I right in thinking I should get a second opinion from M D Anderson in Orlando? Any suggestions or comments or encouragement would be sincerely appreciated.
