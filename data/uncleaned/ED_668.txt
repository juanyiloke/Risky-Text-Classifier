Good? I don't know.I honestly can't say if I've been good lately when it comes to my eating, or I've fallen back onto bad habbits. I'm still only eating one meal a day, with maybe one snack. I really push the fluids now a days, almost replacing food for liquids. My Mom did just prepare a sandwhich for me while I watched her, I wasn't allowed to help prepare it. But I could feel my nerves rising as I watched her make it. It was a normal sandwhich, I guess: I took it downstairs and practically disected it. I even feel sick to my belly now. I don't know what to do anymore, nothing is changing now. I'm honestly trying to get better, but nothing seems to be working. :(
