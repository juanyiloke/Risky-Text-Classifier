TRYING TO BUY AN ANNUAL TRAVEL INSURANCE IS IMPOSSIBLE  6  I have very, very mild asthma, I only take one Montelukast tablet each night, do not need inhalers, but trying to buy an annual travel insurance for this pre-existing condition is totally useless.  My husband died a few weeks ago and because of his illness COPD/emphysema/bronhiectasis we have never had a holiday for the past four years.  My sons are taking me on a  cruise next year and I was looking into the possibility of getting an annual policy as it works out cheaper in the long run.  I cannot find one company, Saga, Age UK that will even consider me for an annual policy.  It is absolutely ridiculous. Does anyone on here know of any good travel policies that you can buy.  I thought Saga and Age Uk would be the ones to go for but no, they do not want to know.   I would be very grateful if someone knows of any.
