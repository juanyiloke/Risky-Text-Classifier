Has anyone been to Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez's office in New York?Hey everyone, my family wanted to know if anybody here has ever gone to see Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez in New York? My mother has been diagnosed with adecnocarcinoma of the lungs with mets to the brain/liver. We just wanted to hear some first-hand or second-hand testimonials to help make the decision to see him much easier. We know he's a well-known physician in the area of alternative treatments but we haven't been able to hear from many patients or loved ones. Hope you guys can help! Thank you.
