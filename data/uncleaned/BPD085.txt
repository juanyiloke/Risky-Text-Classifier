PTSD vs. BPD: hypervigilance, anxiety, catastrophizingby Starlit » Wed May 27, 2015 9:58 pmI just posted this in another thread, but gonna repost it here for a more in-depth discussion.I woke up with intense anxiety yesterday and have had very high levels of anxiety on and off since. It seems to be especially bad in the mornings upon waking up. I think it's related to thinking something terrible may have happened as I slept that I could have prevented if I hadn't slept but that it is too late to do anything about now and that the consequences of whatever happened will be intense and severe and I'll be helpless. I think a lot of it revolves around abandonment (bad things happening to ppl I care about, ppl deciding to cut contact irrevocably, ppl killing themselves). May also be related to what the new day may hold. Having to face situations I'm not equipped to deal with in general. Anyone have something similar? I seem to have a tendency not only to catastrophise and expect the worst but to expect or be terrified of being put into situations that I will be unable to deal with or escape or in that I'll feel helpless in general. I talked to a friend about it and she commented saying that this sounded PTSD-ish. Now I'd like to hear your input. Is this something you struggle with as well? While I do see my friend's point (hypervigilance, fear of re-experiencing trauma, i.e. an overwhelming situation that you're not equipped to deal with, feel/ are helpless/ powerless in, cannot escape etc.), I'd been sure this was a natural part of BPD (catastrophizing, zeroing in on the negative possibilities, potentially high levels of anxiety) as well up until she made her comment . What are your thoughts on/ experiences with this?Thanks in advance.
