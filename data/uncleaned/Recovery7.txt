I have a hard time keeping myself accountable with stuff. I decided I would like to post in this thread each day to mark whether or not I have completed my tasks for the day. Feel free to do so in here as well. For me, I have things organized by cards, so I can mark if I finished the tasks on my red card, blue card, and green card, the tasks on the red card being the most urgent daily cards. It is almost midnight and so far I have not completed any of my cards, so it's kind of too late to do that today.
