Train Ticket's« on: January 14, 2010, 08:57:29 AM »Has any one heard the sad story of an old lady in her late seventies who  travelling long distance on a major train service.Some guard at one of the stations where she had to change trains, sent her to the wrong train, he had sent her on an earlier train than she should have been on.After boarding the train, the ticket collector asked quite rightly to see her ticket, she was then informed that she had the wrong ticket for the journey, and was charged in excess  of £100 for a new ticket.The old lady was quite distressed over having to pay for the journey again, as she had not got that kind of money in her purse. Just then a very kind young man got up and went round all the passengers, doing a collection. The money was  paid over to the ticket collector,and every one thought that would be the end of the story, but know when the train stopped at the next station the police where waiting to arrest the kind man, for begging on the train. the guard had  rung the police to arrest this man.As far as I know it has now been sorted out and the train company has apologised, but as yet know one knows who the guard was .
