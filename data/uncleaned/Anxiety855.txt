Stuck in a cycle of anxietyHi I'm new here and and have never been on a forum before so this is very new for me telling other people about the anxieties I am feeling, but I want to try and see if anyone can help or relate to this.I have always had a real fear of social situations and it has affected me my whole life especially in workplaces where I have struggled to cope. Twice I have ended up in reaching a breaking point where It builds up to worrying constantly and not being able to sleep , anxiety giving stomach problems and acid reflux, and I end up in an anxious depressed state.I was lucky to get the job I am in now after leaving my last one because of not being able to cope with the stress, where I was having to sort out problems in a very badly organized company.I'm struggling with anxiety now and am determined not to end up living in this cycle of anxiety again, I tell myself it will pass, but worry a lot because of the insomnia.I've started sleeping tablets but don't want to end up dependent on them.Thanks for reading my post, any advice would be appreciated.
