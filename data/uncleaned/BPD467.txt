 My introduction, and some helpful words.Hello, I'm Jay i'm 23 and from England.I Have BPD and i was diagnosed when i was 20.I've come here to help, tell my stories and to make new friends.I've had BPD since i was about 12 - 13, but because psychologist cant diagnose this disorder because your personality isn't developed yet, i was told many things, life has been hard.What also makes me very unique here in the UK is i'm BPD and male (here its 1 in 5 is male)I've done some stupid stuff in the past, my mental health record is huge, but im here to say, no matter what YOU'VE done, never be ashamed.I'm here to say, no matter how bad life gets, how tough your bpd gets and how much you're struggling, life always has its ways of sorting its self out.Never give up.You may feel flat, you may feel hopeless, you may feel useless, but theirs something out there you're here to fight for.Trust me i know.BPD i've found is one of them quirks that when im happy. im ecstatic and that's what i look for i struggle to make friends, im socially awkward, im clingy, im wise, i have paranoia, i have anxieties ect, but in the end that's me.If anyone would like to talk, or would like help, ive been through it all, feel free to PM meThanksJay
