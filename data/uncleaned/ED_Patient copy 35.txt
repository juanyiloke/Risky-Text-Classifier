Selective eating disorder???I'm 20 years old , all my life I have been extremely fussy when it comes to food I pretty much live off pizza,(just cheese) crisps sweets chips(only thin chips) I eat some meat but I'm very funny about fat. I'm always ill because I'm not getting the neutrients I need. I can't try new food without gagging or being sick. I been to see a few dieticians but they don't help. I'm fed up of being like this because when friends or family go for food I always have to look at menu to see if there's anything I'll eat 9/10 I won't like anything. Has anyone got any suggestions about what I do next? Or will I be like this forever??
