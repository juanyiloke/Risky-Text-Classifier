Movies About Depression/overcoming DepressionMy screen name says it all. I am a big movie fan, as it helps me escape for a few hours. I love movies dealing with psychology and twist and turns. I was wondering if anybody knew of any good movies that deal with depression or overcoming depression.I would also like to know if anybody has any suggestions on movies about characters who have to overcome odds. What I mean is are there any movies where the main character/characters has a really crappy life. They are lonely, no self confidence, depressed, etc. Ordinary People, Good Will Hunting, Half Nelson, etc.. are some of the movies I have already seen that deal with psychology and depression.I would love to get some suggestions from fellow members. Thanks.
