Depression Help   Epoxyman , 15 Apr 2015Hi guys hope I am posting this in the right place. Just want to ask a few things and make sure I get the right help To start out with I am a 49 year old male with a wife of 27 years and two grown kids.I have a really bad anger problem and its just getting worse and worse as time gos by. A few weeks ago my wife said she was leaving and has had enough so I ask if she would stayif I went and got help she said yes. We went to see a very nice lady and had a talk with her for a little over a hour.She had me do a small little test forget the name of it but had like 12 questions. My score was like a 16 or 17 and she says I have Major depression. I could of fell off the chair when se told me this but it is what it is. She said she could send me to a Psychiatrist but it cost a lot and we have no Ins to cover the cost.I do see my reg doctor for my high blood pressure about every 3-4 months. She said ask my doctor if he would feel comfortable prescribing anti depression drug. My wife was there and asked could we do it with out drugs and she said it seems to her I have had this for a very long time and the std talking would not help much. So I am here to ask should I seek a diff doctor or just go to a Psychiatrist on my own. I just do not want to start taking a hand full of pill and hope it all gos away.I know I need help just trying to find the right help. Thanks for any info back.Ron.
