Happy Easter to everyone :)¥	Hope everyone is doing well,¥	I had my first chemo on Frid 3rd April it was ok but i was very ill that evening but feeling better now thankfully.¥	I do have a blurry left eye and slight ringing in my left ear is this normal? lol im not sure if its just me or its the chemo!¥	Also what will i feel when my hair starts coming out will my scalp hurt? i actually starting tugging my hair when they where actually putting the chemo into me like it was going to come out straight away! lol lol.¥	I have to say i was scared as hell when i saw the drugs i am on 6xFEC and the syringes scared the crap out of me but at least the first one is over and i know what to expect next time! ¥	Mx
