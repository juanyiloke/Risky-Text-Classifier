ÊI'm terrified of a cure for schizophrenia.I'm terrified if they come out with a cure that gets rid of every single symptom that the dramatic change my life and that I won't be able to cope with living with constant hallucinations 24/7 to nothing. I know it sounds stupid and most people would be ecstatic but I'm the complete opposite. I'm terrified I'll go crazy in some other way. It's exhausting to have to deal with hallucinations 24/7 but it's been 10 years now. No medicine works for me so I've learned to adjust and live like this and if they came up with a cure, my life would be flipped upside down and that scares me so much.Ê
