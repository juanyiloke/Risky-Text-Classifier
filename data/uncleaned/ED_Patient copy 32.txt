I can't keep my food down and get headaches and painHello everyone... Just looking for some advice but not to sure what i'm going thru, over the last few days i havent been able to keep any food down, one night i had something to eat and a few hours later had a pint down the pub with a friend, then i got really bad pain in my tummy and threw up, it's not the drink because ever since then i have not been able to keep much of my food down, i have also been getting headaches alot and feeling light headed but i have been drinking enough. I just want to find out if this could be something else that needs checking...I have had a few dizzy episodes and they seem fine just laying down but one night i slept for about 16 hours solid and still felt really tired after and had to go back to sleep for a further 4 hours.ThanksMartin P
