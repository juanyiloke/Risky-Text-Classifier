Daily Express nonsense.I apologise for bringing this up, I try very heard not to read this rag, but my nearest supermarket will insist on using their product placement knowledge and put the papers at the front door.It would seem that a vegetarian diet is the answer to diabetes, cut out the meat and we're cured (not sure about type Is), so says the Daily Express. Has anyone complained about a paper or reporter before, I've got a few days rest coming up, I'll look into it. Any pointers would be welcome
