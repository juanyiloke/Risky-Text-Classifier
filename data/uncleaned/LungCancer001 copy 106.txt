Playing the "Lets see if your pulmonary nodules grow" waiting gameI'm a 49yr old former smoker (smoke free since 2004). I have had pneumonia in my late 20's, and had my first positive PPD when returning from Desert Shield in 1992. I found out yesterday that I have 2 pulmonary nodules on right lung via CT scan. CT revealed one is 5mm and located in the middle lobe of the lung. The other more troubling nodule is 9.8mm and located in the lower lobe. The CT report only lists the size and location of the 5mm nodule. CT report descibes 9.8mm nodule having an "irregular" margin and a DX stating "possible malignancy". The chest x-ray report says it is noncalcified. When I use the Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Malignancy Risk Calculator and use the 9.8mm nodule info, I come up with a 14% chance of malignancy, but then I have that other one to think about too, so I really have no idea what the chances are I'm going to be battling lung cancer in the near future. I would love to hear from someone that had similar initial findings and what the outcome has been.Of course the doctors want me to have scans at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months. Not only do I not want to wait, that seems like one heck of alot of radiation exposure to monitor this damn thing, as well as being costly. Is there anyway to get a conclusive diagnosis without having to wait until they decide it's growing or not??? I have read doing a biopsy on such a small tumor is usually difficult and typically inconclusive. Any thoughts, advice, comments, appreciated.
