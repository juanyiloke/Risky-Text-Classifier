Pensiongood day all, this is my first post and I need independent advise, I have a private pension its value is 130k laat year its was 144k , 5 years ago I removed  it from the financial market and told my financial adviser to place the money in Bonds and cash, the first few years were ok and it held it's own, then the interest rate was cut to a pittance, with the Pension Company charges and Financial charges it has reduced  to the value below, I am considering taking the pension out in one full payment which I can do although the Tax will be about 35k, with the instability in the markets I am concerned that it will be eaten away with charges and more market down turns, my financial adviser is not keen for me to tale it out in one go because he will loose his yearly charge, I am not convinced by him that it will improve, my age is 63 I don't need the money, but I do not want any more of a loss on the pension, what advice if any do other members have,
