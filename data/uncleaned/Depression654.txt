 One step forward, two steps back - **TRIGGERS**Started by dr0701?, 09-03-15 07:11 AMI hope no-one minds me venting on here, I know that's what the forum is for, but part of this cruel mistress called depression is me feeling like I'm getting everyone around me down.I've been diagnosed with depression on more than one occasion in the past, but each time I've come through it in time.I feel like I've been fine for a couple of years, like everyone else I've had the odd "down" day, but always bounce back. However, over the past few weeks things have taken a turn for the worse and I've been left feeling very low again, far worse than I have felt for a long, long time.Work has been horrendously busy lately, with lots of good friends being made redundant - my job is safe for the time being, but there's that spectre hanging around that it could happen to me too.It all came to a head this weekend when I'd arranged to meet up with some old school friends - nothing wrong with that in itself, but afterwards I was left realising how little I had in common with them as it turns out they hadn't been my friends at school after all, they were even asking how I'd become part of their social group for this meet-up. That really struck a nerve, as I'd always been a bit of a loner at school, just concentrating on working hard and getting through exams.I have a loving family who know what I'm going through, but there's only so much help they can give, and I don't like them seeing me at my worst - however, I've found myself driving in to work having horrible dark thoughts again about how to take away my mental pain and anguish, something I'd hoped I would never think about again.Again, I'm sorry if this upsets anyone, but I feel this is the best way to get things off my chest.Thanks for listening.D.
