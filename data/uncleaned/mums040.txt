We are moving in to a 3 story house, meaning DD is on the floor below us with her own bathroom. She is 2.ÊDownstairs from her floor is a living room and kitchen, then upstairs from her floor is our room. What do you do about stair gates?I don't want her to fall down stairs or wander downstairs etc in the night and her having access to the bathroom scares me as she loves water. But in a few months when we start to toilet train, she will need access to the toilet at night. Stair gates or not? On top of stairs to downstairs or on her bedroom door?
