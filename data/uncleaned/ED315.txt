ÊI'm frightenedMy mum just made a family meal and we all say round and are like always but as usual I found myself eating too much. I have problems with self restraint and felt uncomfortably full after I'd finished. I went and purged some of it. This is the second time I've done this in a two week period. It used to be once a month roughly. What do I do? I'm really scared I don't want a problem but I hate food so much I'm terrified of beig fat and overweight, I never eat anything unhealthy anymore and exercise nearly everyday. I can't talk to my parents they have enough to worry about and this would freak them out even further, they worry about me enough as it is. I'm sorry for the ramblings I'm just scaring myself. I know what I'm doing is wrong but it's like I have to do it.
