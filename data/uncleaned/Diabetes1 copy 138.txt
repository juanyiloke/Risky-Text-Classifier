Type 1 diabetes. Stopped insulin injectionI was diagnosed with type 1 4 months ago. Hba1c 75 (6.9%), ketones greater than 1.1. I dropped my carb consumption, started exercising a lot and was put on long and short acting insulin. My hba1c 4 days ago was 33 (5.2%). Out of curiosity I decided to stop taking insulin to see how my results would react. I've taken no insulin for 4 days. My blood sugars are fine, rising to 8ish after eating and dropping back down to between 4-5 four hours later. My ketones are normal. Has anyone any experience of stopping insulin injections? Is this a short term thing? Any info is much appreciated
