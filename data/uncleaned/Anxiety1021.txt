How's your Pulse Rate? I average 90 at restMy at-rest pulse rarely drops below 90.ÊIt is uncomfortable makes it hard for me to relax. If I get even more nervous and my heart rates goes 100~120 I take some Lorazepam to help. (I have had a few panic attacks 150+bps but don't have those anymore now that I know what panic attacks are and a fast heart-rate, by itself is not dangerous) I have complained a couple times to my doctor but they don't seem concerned. I would like to take Lorazepam(or like) more often but I would run out too quick so I just suffer with a heart rate constantly near 90.Can't remember the last pulse rate was below 80 don't think it goes below even when I sleep. Before my life fell apart 3 years ago I averaged just under 60 bps.It does not happen when I am thinking of something specificallyI have plenty of things that are causing me stress/anxious, so the fact that I have anxiety and that it elevated my pulse rate makes sense to me. However I find it rather annoying that even when don't have anything stressful on my mind my heart rate is still high, Its like a constant reminder that there are still many things in my life unsettled.Just wanted to here what others here experience as far as pulse-rate.What is your average pulse rate at rest?How much does it climb or fall? (not including exercise)What do any of you with anxiety and fast heart rate do about it?
