is it too late to apply for a new course?by baconfriesHi, im new here, and i was just wondering whether someone could help me. I'm a first year, Its coming up to the end of years exams and just like probably everyone else, ive had end of year projects and stuff to do. Its taken till now for me to decide i dont like my course, I've been kind of struggling since the start but ive passed every piece of work that's been assessed and all my January exams, i always think "yes I've finally got it!" But then i realise i don't, i kinda thought more people were like that and i wasn't the only one but I'm having second thoughts about that, its just the same old cycle. I dont want to drop out of uni because I'd feel ashamed that I'd wasted such a big thing, but i was wondering if it was possible to change course or apply for a different course i could start next year (from year 1). I want to stay in the same uni, just I'm considering changing courses. Also, I'm studying in Wales and I'm Welsh, would student finance and stuff still cover me? Thanks in advance, sorry for my noobness lol
