Libre I've gone and done it..I received my second email yesterday..So have thought and discussed it with hubby... Decided why not, lets go ahead with it...Disappointed that it's going to take between 3-5 working days to get it here, so looking at getting it between Tues - Thursday, I was hoping that it would be delivered quicker so I could get it up and running before returning to work from annual leave on Thursday.Mind you saying that I'm not sure how work going to take it.... I bet there will be a moan, and a request to remove it until I've had an assessment! Which they will be informed that if they want to pay for a new sensor I be happy to take it off, if they won't then it's staying...
