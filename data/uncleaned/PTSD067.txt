Survivors Guilt - Walk AwayHi - I am a survivor from the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Out of the 5 of us including myself in the south tower on 78, 3 died. One person was leaving with me and said he forgot something in his office. I said I'll see you downstairs, I went straight and he turned right to go to his office. I was outside when the plane hit our side of the building and our floor. He didn't get out.My family does a lot of volunteer work at 2 museums, its important to me that these 2977 people including my 3 friends are not forgotten. We know some of their family members and have met many, many family members over the years and some have become good friends of ours.The other person my office that got out has basically bottled up his experience, sold his house in 2003, 2004 and doesn't talk about it at all. His only son at that time was 10 months old and almost 14 years later, doesn't even know his dad was there that day. On the 11th, he simply says a prayer and goes on with his day.There are many times, like today, I think he has it right, put it away and forget about it.Not really sure how to go with this, any suggestions would be more than appreciated...
