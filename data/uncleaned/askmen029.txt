Woman cleaning men's bathrooms w/men in them2014-01-20, 10:40 PMI need advice on how not to feel uncomfortable with this, please. At my job I'm required to clean all the bathrooms once an hour, on the hour, including the men's rooms. (We're a really busy place, so the bathrooms get dirty awfully fast.) The thing is, even if I block the doorway with the trashcan and verbally tell men they're not allowed in, a lot of times one will still come in, and after he does all the others will. The bathroom also doubles as a locker room/changing room where men are taking their clothes off. So, how do I quit feeling awkward and learn to accept this as just a part of my job?
