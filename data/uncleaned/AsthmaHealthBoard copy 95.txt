What can I do to make my dr take me more seriously?________________________________________Okay so I've been seeing this doctor for 7 years now. I first saw him about my shortness of breath about 5 years ago (I've always had episodes but up until that time they were extremely rare). No tests were done. I was given an inhaler and sent on my way. Last year during my physical I told them that I was still having trouble-sometimes scary episodes. I was given a prescription for 3 more refills of inhaler and sent on my way. Now I'm no doctor but I think I might have asthma and from what I've been reading about it, it sounds like I should be doing more to control it. It's gotten to where I use the inhaler 1 to 2 times every day- and it's getting out of hand. I just get brushed off. I don't know of many doctors that are as reasonable price wise. Is there something I could say to get the ball rolling? Any advice?
