Training my new boss________________________________________Bit of a strange one, hopefully it's in the right place as I wasn't sure. I'm in a quite pressured and intense job and I love it. I keep on top of my workload by being very organised and working an hour late to organise myself for the next day. It suits me really as I live away from home mid week for work.Anyways new colleague started with more experience in the particular role but not industry. My background is industry specific but I had less experience in the exact job when I started. I know she's senior to me and it's ok as I knew the score when she was hired.I just feel after two weeks it's a bit much to start questioning everything I do. We had a high level of training and I'm good at my job so I know I'm doing things right. It's starting to both distract me at work and annoy me having to justify myself. I'm not sure how to handle this as she's new and is my boss. I don't know her well enough to know how she could handle confrontation. Or if it's a good idea?
