Hi - I was vaguely diagnosed with a light case of PTSD. I'm a 35 year old woman - and looking for group resources in Los Angeles that might be helpful. Does anyone know if any? What's weird or hard for me is that I get so demoralized by people trying to press me or take advantage - that it feels a little debilitating. It really bothers me even when businesses try to screw you over - that is how my symptoms are manifesting. When my realtors tried to sue me for a full real estate commission after I let them go even though they didn't sell my house - that bothers me. It's so wrong it's beyond wrong - but these are kindof life events, I just have a stronger reaction to them than most people I guess. To the point I'm so stressed I get a little shortness of breath, etc. Does anyone else have a similar diagnosis - or have supporting reasons to see how this could be PTSD, or think my diagnosis is BS? Thanks!
