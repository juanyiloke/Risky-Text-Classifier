Letting Go of PerfectionismHi All,I have spoken to a few people about high standards or perfectionism. The link between perfectionism and my mental health has been strong for over two decades. If I don't do a perfect job (in my mind) there is something seriously wrong with me. If someone is looking at me, again, (in my mind) they are srutinising me and there is something seriously wrong with me. I am tired. I am trying to get used to doing a good enough job instead of a perfect job. It is taking time but I am already feeling the benefits. And if someone really is looking or staring at me then so be it; the problem is their's and not mine. My guess is that some of us worry too much about what we do and what other people think. I am not talking about doing the wrong thing or hurting other people. Instead I am talking (actually rambling) about lowering the care factor to a healthy level. If anyone knows more about lowering high or perfectionistic standards, or has something to add, please give me a reply.Kind Regards,Brett.  Just diagnosed with bipolar disorderWelcome,My name is Brett and I have just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This certainly wasn't welcome news but, in looking back at my life, it makes sense of a lot of my experiences. I have experienced a few amazing highs (or so I thought at the time) and a lot of lows. Apart from getting some of my thoughts onto this site, I really wanted to share a simple idea. That is, I have decided to lead the healthiest lifestyle I can in order to stay well. To many, this might sound a little obvious but, as I am heading towards a cycle of depression, it is very easy to lose hope. I wont go through the long list of what I am going to do to stay well other than to say I am going to follow the advice given to me by my trusted support people. I hope that a simple decision can help you too. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you wellness and happiness. Kindest Regards,Brett.
