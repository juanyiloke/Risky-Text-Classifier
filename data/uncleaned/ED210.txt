ÊIt's gotten worseLast year I was diagnosed with anorexia. Over this year's course I have managed to maintain my weight with a lot of effort at it's current range.ÊThese last few months have been really hard on me because I've been using [moderated] and skipping meals frequently. I've forced myself off of [moderated] thankfully but I still need to have some control over my eating and being able to do things regularly? I've been eating compulsively to the point my stomach feels like it's ripping open and then I turn around and not eat for long periods of time.I want to stop eating but then again I want to every single thing I can think of regardless of my stomach pains.I'm really just super sick right now and I don't know what to do.
