Unsure on what to do________________________________________I am just wondering if anyone could advise me on a situation i am in. I had three interviews for internships last week for the summer. I got an email this morning being offered a place and to call up Friday to basically sign up. My problem is i want to wait and see how the others pan out and weigh up all my options. I am not sure how to approach it if i tell them i want to weigh up my options they might tell me where to go. Then if i don't get the other offers i will have no internship. Has anybody any advice on how to approach this situation.
