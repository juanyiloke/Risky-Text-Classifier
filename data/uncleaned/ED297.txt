ÊDistraught at how much I have eatenI have Anorexia Nervosa. I don't know when it started because I was in denial about it for a very long time but over the last few months it has gotten worse and worse. I asked for help and became determined to get better. I was referred to a dietician but that didn't really help as the psychology behind my eating issues were not addressed. I am on the waiting list for therapy and I had been feeling motivated to get better. I started eating more (of my own accord, without any therapy or support) but then I couldn't cope with the weight I put on. It was only a few pounds but that felt too much so I guess I started relapsing. I have been restricting for just over a week now and lost a few pounds but today I have binged and I feel distraught. I am so upset over what I have eaten and the amount and I am terrified that I'm going to gain the pounds back or even more. I feel so bloated and my stomach is sticking right out. I feel sick too. I seriously want to die right now and I can't cope. Please help. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with binges? I just can't deal with this anxiety.
