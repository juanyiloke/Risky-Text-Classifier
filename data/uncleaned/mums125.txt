I've been doing loads of reading about so-called 'flat head syndrome' and am hearing lots of contradictory things (as usual on the web!). My four month old daughter has a pronounced flat patch at the right side of the back of her head, so it looks very slanted from above. She was five weeks premature and I initially just assumed the slant was to do with the birth not realising it was how she was lying.ÊI have her sitting up a lot during the day, carry her a lot and put her on a theraline pillow at night. I'm toiling with tummy time - which ends in crying after a few minutes right now. I really and truly don't want to see her in one of those helmets and I have a strong suspicion they may be a bit of a waste of time.ÊHas anyone else had a baby who developed a flat patch? It would be great to hear your experiences - what worked, what didn't. Should I just calm down and let time sort it out?
