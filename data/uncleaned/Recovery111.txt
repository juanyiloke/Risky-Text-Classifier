The Unseen ( A Little Thing I Made ) ( For My Story Go To My Posts And Check Out ( Depress To Success ) )the unseen...  dark days, dark times, caused by fear, hate, the need to be, what is free, what is life, where does one go when surrounded by only darkness, how does one lead, create change, when every road leads to a wall, how does one BE...  where is the light when all you see is dark, and when you see a sign of hope, it tricks you, making you feel as if it was just an illusion, having what you wanted, then they shut the door in your face.... How does one HAVE...  where is change, when all you see is walls, having the support of masters ( people with master digrees in stuff ), but being rejected by those in power, how does one DO....  how does one BE, HAVE, DO, education is key.... this is one that people always hear, but is never heard or understood by those who needs it the most... weather its a bully who needs to see what they are causing to others, weather its those who continue to take and push away those who give, without giving back, weather its those who are just too blind to see what one is putting his or her heart in.... THESE PEOPLE are the ones to blame, YOU ARE NOT!!! .. those of you who are unseen, feel down and depressed, feel comfort that you are not alone, that you have done so much in your life and that you have not givin up like those who you hear about, YOU WILL BE REWARDED... and those who do not see that will one day regret every single thing they have ever done.... STAY STRONG .... your time will come .... one way or another .... Thank you for reading :)
