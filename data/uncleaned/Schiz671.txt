ÊAnyone have success getting off meds?

I was wondering if anyone her has been able to successfully stop there meds and not have anymore psychotic episodes/voices? My psychiatrist doesn't want me to get off Risperdal consta injectable and whenever I hint that I would like to eventually come off everything or at least switch meds he makes it seem like I have no choice and should be on it without even thinking about coming off. He said he knows how I hate hospitals and it would be wise to continue, but I want to know if there is any hope of coming off.
