ÊTraffic Tickets and anxiety are preventing my appetiteI have maintained a clean driving record for 12 years and in this past year, have received two speeding tickets. My first was graciously listed under a non-moving violation to avoid points and was just a fine. On monday, I foolishly made a quick right turn at an intersection because the cars to my left were blocking my view of oncoming traffic...I should have waited. After safely completing the turn I was again stopped for speeding.ÊI take full responsibility for my actions, and at the same time, my anxiety has prevented me from eating for 3 days. I feel like I won't be able to eat again until the next 3 years of my life have passed by and the tickets are cleared from my record.Please know that I am in no way looking for pity. I am badly in need of help to regain my appetite!ÊThank you so much for your advice!
