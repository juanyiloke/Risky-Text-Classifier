ÊenablingI have PTSD due to trauma, both childhood trauma and adult trauma. The traumatic experiences finally stopped about 10 years ago and over the years I've learned that I need to take responsibility for my choices in life.ÊHowever, as part of that process I have also had to learn not to take responsibility for other peoples choices. It comes from the deeply ingrained feelings from childhood, that if somebody treats me badly, their choice has something to do with me = it must be my fault.ÊThis is a specific attitude that makes people like myself vulnerable to abusive relationships. It is common for abusers to make themselves out to be (and even believe) that they are the hard done by victim - that they wouldn't be abusive if...I've had a hard daypressure is getting to meyou caught me at a bad timeyou don't know what I've been through in my lifeif you'd had it as I have, you would be like me tooBut other people often want to get involved and smooth things over...well, they have had a hard lifethey can be a bit feisty, just ignore itthey're usually niceI'm sure it was nothingIt will blow overyou must understand they are very stressed at the momentBut by passing on all responsibility to the recipient of aggression, everybody involved enables it. Self-responsibility is key - however hard done by someone imagines themselves to be, however worse off than everyone else - enabling people to stay in that frame of mind and sweeping up after they abuse others, isn't supportive. It won't help them in the long run.Enabling becomes ingrained, but it doesn't succeed in preventing poor behaviour, it gives the message that it's ok. But more importantly here, it doesn't help those people that are stuck in the loop and giving up on their lives.
