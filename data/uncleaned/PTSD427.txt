ÊHow to deal with doctor apptsI have been delaying my yearly check-up for over a year now. Im 19, so I dont have a PCP at all. I am fine with that except now I cant get a dietician (i just came out of an eating disorder hospitilization) and I cant get my eyes checked because I need a referral from a PCP. I am willing to accept those consequences because I dont want to go. But my family isnt going to let me and I live with them and they feed and house me, so i dont have a choice.And of course they want to know why and i dont want to talk about it. Nothing even happened but the normal check-up stuff jut freaked me out as a kid. it makes me sick just thinking about it. But theyre going to think someone did something wrong. And when i was little i tried to tell my mom that the normal stuff made me uncomfrotable but she ridiculed me because i was complaining and my brother had gotten a shot and i hadnt.I tried to explain other ptsd stuff recently and they said nothing that had happened was a sexual assaut and that I wasnt dissociating, I was just zoming out. ect, ect. Im not doing that again. But Im sick to my stomach about it all and I dont know what to do. ANd I dont need to be ridiculed for being a baby and not wanting to go to the doctors. SO i thought maybe someoone on here could help b/c I dont know what to do and Im scared.
