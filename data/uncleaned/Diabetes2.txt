Dr out of line?My father underwent a double leg amputation recently. He has been on dialysis for 6 years and had a 5 bypass heart surgry 9 years ago. He has been diabetic for 25 years. The surgon has kept an interesting relationship with my father, keeping in touch.. far more in touch then surgons usually stay(from what nursing home staff say.) The Surgon has brought gifts to my father such as a tv, and a patigonia sweater. I say okay to that, cool. But the surgon brings 2 pounds of chocolate candy one day. I dont understand how he of all people would bring a diabetic with no mobility for excersise, that much sugar. feedback and ideas much appreciatedthanks, jordan
