Mentally drained on weekendsHi all.ÊI've been suffering from GAD for about 2 and a half years. I've done hypnotherapy, self help books, counselling, exercise and cutting out caffeine. All of which have helped a great deal. I've also been on anti depressants which helped me get through the worst of it. There is just one problem I can't seem to fix. Brain drain! I work Monday to Friday and by the time I get to the weekend I just crash. My head feels like somethings pressing inside and it makes me feel like I can't face or do anything! Even watching TV is sometimes too much effort. I don't get this at all in the week. Is anyone else on here incapable of resting without getting mentally fatigued? I've search on and off for the past 2 years on the Internet for answers but I can't find anything. Has anyone else suffered or suffering from the same thing?
