ÊReally, Really bad day.I don't know what to do today... It has been such a bad day for me...ÊSo full of anxiety today, I couldn't bring myself to eat at all after noon hour so I'm way behind on calories and I still can't get up the nerve to have anything now.I had an anxiety attack at work and called my mom, freaked her out enough so that she's now on her way home, threatening to take me to the hospital. I really don't know what to do. I don't know if she's serious. I don't know why I can't get myself to eat. It shouldn't be this hard. I just can't tonight. It's like being hungry again is comforting, and I can't have that taken away. I wish this would stop
