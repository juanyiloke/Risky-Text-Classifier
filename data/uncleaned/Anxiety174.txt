Is this anxiety? Ê14    Hi, I am a 17 year old male senior in high school, and my life has been a living hell for the past 6 months. So it all started back in late October of 2014 when I felt sick and missed almost a week of school. Since then, I've been having persistent nausea EVERYDAY. I also have lots of gas, I belch excessively. I'm fatigued all the time, part of which is probably because I'm not getting good sleep. Also, I frequently have diarreah in the morning.I've been to the doctor and they give me acid-suppressing medication and send me away. I've tried various medication (tecta, rabeprazole, metoclopramide, ranitidine and sucraflate coating) none of which have helped. Blood test/stool test/breath test came back normal.ÊCan this be anxiety causing these symptoms?? The only thing I'm stressed about is the fact that I have nausea, gas, fatigue. Why am I not getting better? What should I do?? PLEASE HELP
