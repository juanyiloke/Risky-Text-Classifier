Looking for ValidationI've never been officially diagnosed with an ED (though I've asked to talk about it with my doctor during my next appointment and have mentioned it before) and now that I'm trying to recover I feel almost like a fake...like I never had a problem to begin with even though I'm sure I had/have OSFED (previously EDNOS). I still have to roughly count my calories for the day to feel comfortable among other things so I really just want to get diagnosed so I can recover. Not sure that makes much sense.  I'm also afraid they won't take it seriously because I'm not starving myself. Anyone have advice?
