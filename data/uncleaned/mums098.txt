Just need a rant actually.Most Sunday nights in tired from the weekend and wabt to get some sleep ready for work on Monday. Dd is 13 and has her usual weekday bedtime of 9.30 which is normally stretched to 10 with teeth cleaning and faffing.This is usually fine for her and she's askeep in minutes.On Sunday's a combo of changed sleep patterns and slight anxiety around school means she doesn't go to sleep and instead continues to call me and wake me up sometimes untill 1am and I literally lose the plot with her. I've told her she doesn't need to wake me but to just read or lie quietly untill she nods off but she cannot do this and just keeps calling me or crying loudly so I can hear her.Yes it's as bizarre as that. I literally don't know what to do. I'm so angry now thst I cant sleep, I ended up swearing at her which I never do normally but I can't take being repeatedly woken up and the knowledge that I have a half hour drive to work and a long tough day after a crap nights sleep. I'm so fed up right now
