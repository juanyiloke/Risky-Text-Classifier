Freestyle Neo Blood Glucose meter issuesHiI have had this meter for about a year now and whilst i think it is accurate it also really really sensitive to the blood going on the strip.it seems as if a large drop is presented it seems to suck the blood up too quickly and gives an E-7 error message.Conversely if the drop is slightly on the small side it goes to an E-3 error message so quickly that there is not enough time to press one's finger to pop a bit more blood onto the strip.Does anybody else have this meter and do they have this problemI am wasting approx 10-15 strips per month because of this.
