I have recently been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder because I had a difficult delivery of my son and ended up unable to walk after I'd given birth. Needless to say life with a new born was tough enough without the other complications! My son is now 5 months old and I am getting close to being able to walk unaided again. But I relive the birth constantly and wish I could go back in time. My partner gets very frustrated with me. I'm sure he thinks I should just "get over it". I am suffering with strong bouts of depression (made significantly worse by sleep deprivation), but I feel totally alone and unsupported. I have just started seeing a therapist and hope to move forward with my bad thoughts and feelings. But I am finding it hard to feel happy in my relationship because I feel let down by him. I'm so deeply confused about everything. If I talk to him and he feels it's a criticism we end up in a blazing argument which is not doing my physical or mental health any good. So I keep quiet for a while but find myself suffering in silence instead and I know that is not healthy either. I realise relationships take a lot of hard work and I am willing to put in effort to work together with him...but I think he just thinks " oh shut up going on woman" when I talk to him about anything in depth. I don't know if I can cope with the stress of the relationship on top of the other problems I am having. My self esteem is just slowly deteriorating.
