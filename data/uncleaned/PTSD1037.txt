I have PTSD and I'm still struggling with it after more then 5 years. Is having problem with emotional memory a symptom of PTSD? I remember my past intellectually but not emotionally, like when my grand-father die I was not able to cry even if he was one of the people I care most in my life, it like I didn't get it. I still don't remember him emotionally. I wonder if this wall my mind created to protect me will ever go away? What can I do to be able to feel again? I heard that Zoloft can help, is it true? Anyone that can help me with this will be very appreciate! Take Care
