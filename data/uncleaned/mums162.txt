we live in a tiny house with a tiny strip of a garden. both ds's are football mad, ds1 esp. kicked a ball before he could walkelderly, well in her 60'2 neighbour is very fond of her gardening and has every type of flower imaginable in her tiny strip of gardenwe have a large fence and we recently put up trellis to try to raise it up furtherthe boys football goes over the fence on average once/twice every few weeks, they play well but at 7 and 9 sometimes hit it too high and it goes over in accidentsaid neighbour goes mad, that ball broke a stem etc etc.this has been going on for a few years nowboys can't go to the local park alone as too far and they get told off by other neighbours for playing in the street in case a car gets scratched(they've never done this)I'm at my wits end, I'm constantly telling the boys not to play which to them means don't play football, as I said ds1 is football mad, has many other things to play with but only interested in a ballis there anyone esle with this problem, feel like I'm going mad, have phoned the community police who said you both have to live together, but neighbour is on my case whenever I step out the door
