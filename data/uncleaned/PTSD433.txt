ÊAnniversary of eventHi folks.I was hoping you might have some advice. I'm not diagnosed with PTSD, but I went through a traumatic event some years back. I don't suffer with day to day issues from it, but a big anniversary of it is coming up.Unfortunately, it was a major event and the anniversary is going to be in the news frequently. Especially as it spawns a LOT of political debate. I expect it's going to be pretty bad and I doubt I can avoid all of it, though I'm trying to.I've encountered a few reminders already and I'm really surprised at my reaction. I was extremely angry, and I was sad, remembering what happened and how I felt and the impact it had on my life. I had a strong urge to get away from the reminder but I felt trapped for some reason, almost a little sick. Ever since, even things that don't usually bother me - like a song I relate to it, items that remind me of it - have suddenly become things I don't want to hear or see. It's also brought back the big sense of guilt I felt at the time, for being upset despite not suffering as severely as many others did.I wasn't expecting to have such a strong reaction, and now I'm actually afraid of what's still to come because it will be much, much more intense. I have bipolar and I'm extremely stable, but I'm a little concerned this might knock me off balance.Are there any tactics you use when dealing with difficult anniversaries?
