Help to copeStarted by Fllo?, 11-01-15 01:24 AMNew to this, but Thought I would give it a go. I Struggle to talk to friends and family about things. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and depression about 2 years ago and when my friends found out were so shocked as I am 'the strong one' so I stopped taking my tablets. Lately I feel like I am losing my mind. I seem to of slipped back into a depressive state and avoiding my friends, but I am very clever at covering it up. I keep having uncontrollable thoughts to hurt myself when I'm alone, like conversations with myself in my mind wanting me to (I never do). I am so up and down in the space of a day I'm scared people will start to notice. I'm not sure what is want from this, think it just feels good to put down in words..
