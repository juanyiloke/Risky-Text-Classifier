  Breakthrough - Breakdown? - Breakthrough!Ok,So I've been actually crying and letting tears loose this past week and a half. Haven't done any of that in a couple years. I really feel like I had lost focus of what was important to me in life, and what I really wanted. Or that I wanted anything.I think my problem has a lot to do with:a) workb) growthI've also been forcing myself to go out and about with friends, family, etc. I'm kind of making it a habit to do it everyday. I'm working out everyday... Before all of these things seemed like huge mountains. But I think releasing the backed up emotions finally and moving forward to create new feelings and life experiences is helping.I gave up playing video games online... It's a road to nowhere or atleast that was always my opinion until I got sad and didn't want to hang out with people anymore.Tonight I have finally felt motivated to work again. And not for other people. I can actually feel the entrepreneurial juices flowing and I'm coding some stuff FOR ME AND MINE.Guys whatever you were passionate about before, don't give up on that. That passion has to come back somehow. I've been running from so many shitty feelings but you just have to experience them I guess.I'm not saying I'm cured, but I am saying there's gotta be a light at the end of the tunnel. There has to be!
