Stampede TrialsA month or so in after the first hormone injection and the PSA is coming down, but I have to decide whether I want to take part in the Stampede trial. The control arm is the same as ever, but two new arms have recently opened up, one gives radiotherapy on the primary tumour, the other combines Abiratone and Enzalutimide (i.e. eight tablets a day, plus a steroid, for up to two years).Has anyone any experience of either of these arms and, if so, what sort of side-effects have you had to put up with?
