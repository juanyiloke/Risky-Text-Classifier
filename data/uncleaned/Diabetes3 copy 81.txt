First Aid bags suitable for diabetes kitThe topic of bags for diabetes kit comes around fairly often. I've seen a product that looks suitable, good value, and raises money for a mountain rescue team:http://www.ksmrt.org.uk/Courses/First-Aid-Bag.aspx Scroll down page to picture of orange zipped bag, followed by dimensions, details of pockets etc. Kirkby Stephen Mountain Rescue Team, which serves eastern parts of Howgills and north western parts of Yorkshire Dales is selling empty first aid bags for £6.50 including postage to UK addresses. They're taking preorders now, for dispatch in late June / early July. I've ordered a couple for my own first aid supplies, rather than diabetes kit, as I don't carry as much as many people and find a pencil case that I can move between various rucksack and clothing pockets. Also, a pleasure to support a mountain rescue team. I've only had to call a MRT once, when a safety marshal on a mountain marathon, and a woman with a badly sprained ankle needed help to get down to road. Volunteers, who love the mountains and are always there to help people who get into trouble.
