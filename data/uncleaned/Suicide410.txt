I hate not knowing.AnonymousI hate not knowing. I hate not knowing the point in living, the point in being; in existing. I hate not knowing why humans were put on this earth and somehow evolved into diverse language speaking things.Things.That’s what we are right? We don’t matter. Honestly. From the moon, an astronaut could hold up a pencil at arms length, and from the tiny black space behind the eraser, there are over 10 thousand other galaxies. Not stars. Galaxies.At any moment a star could pass through the milky way, past earth, and pull us into it’s gravitational pull, and we could be left behind once that star leaves, stranded far away from our once home, and everything would freeze over. We would die. We would be a rogue planet.There is no point in human existence or interaction or reproduction or living or breathing or simply being. And I can’t handle not knowing. I want to leave. I want to see what comes after death, so so badly. I want to see if there is a god or a heaven, unlike I believe. Or if there is a black nothing.That’s the thing. I do not get bullied. I have friends. But those friends can’t help me with all of these deep thoughts swirling around my head taunting me, and I just can’t handle this madness. I’m tired of being tired. I want to leave.But I know that the only option for me is pills. And if I fail, it will he a tough road for me ahead. And I’m too scared yo try, but one day I won’t be scared. But right now I only know that I can’t leave because pain will always follow me, before my death, and after my maybe failed attempt. I just want someone to shair my point of view with.Because I hate not knowing.(Please don’t comment with religion. It’s not for me)
