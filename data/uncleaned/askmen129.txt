Questions about paying taxes as a frelancer or contractor2011-12-03, 05:58 PMIf you are a freelance writer and never filled out any w9 or 1099 forms in the u.s. For most ongoing jobs except one, and usenpaypal for transactions, do you have to list theother companies or websites names and money you made from them? Or only the sites you filled out a w9 or 1099 form at? how would you pay taxes and how would the govt. Be able to even track you or audit you ifnit is less than the $20k that paypal requires tonreport. Plyus how coule theybtell you simply didnt receive money for goods or serice rather than a job? Would they actually check your bank account or paypal? Or would they only if you are under some other suspicion? Also, what if someone you work for mentions you as say a deduction. Could they check then?The reason I ask because I heard freelancers have to pay more taxes than average people but this may only have to do with freelancerrs who make than 24k anually? I only make around a grand to $1300 per month and live paycheck to paycheck, so I cant afford to pay mch if any taxes if it hits me next year. I also cobstantly hear Those republicans at the presidential debates keep saying how like 50% dont pay any taxes. So what do I have to do to be part of this percentage? Is it harder as an independent contractor or freelancer to be part of this group than somene who works at save mart?
