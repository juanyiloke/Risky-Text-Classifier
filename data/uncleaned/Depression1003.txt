Topic:ÊA message of hopeÊCancelI wanted to spread a message of hope. I have recently relapsed into anxiety (with depression). Around 3 years ago, being bullied at work with a number of stress made me have a number of panic attacks, issues with sleeping and eating and just feeling like a walking zombie. I had a melt down and it took me 3 weeks before l was better to go back to work. During this time I saw my doctor and got treatment. It was that hardest time in my life and yet te proudest because l went back to work, lodged a compliant with HR because l couldn't let him do that to others. I don't know what happened with him but that's not my issue. I continues working for 3 months and on the morning l was penning my letter to leave work, I was called into a meeting to be told my job was made redundant. I was going to leave and yet l scored a redunancy payout!ÊI made the mistake of thinking l was better earlier this year and l stopped taking my tablets. Considently this, I lasted a fairly long time before my anxiety took over. Add a breakup, stressful work, neighbour issues, moving, sick grandma etc. I am back on my meds and l knownl will be fine. I say l have an anxiety disorder but when it gets out of hand, I get symptoms of depression.Ê. Know that depression is just a disease and you can get better (just remember to listen to you doctor!). Tell yourself you are not a depressed person you just have depression. Be kind to yourself as this is a terrible disease and let others help you recover. Practice smiling and force yourself o laugh and be silly - eventually you won't have to :)Êplease remember you are not along as this affects far too many and l hope my message has given you hopeÊpippa and her kittens Bam Bam and Pebbles (see profile pic)
