Ênot certain any longerSo I'm not certain what to say or type or anything. I have been hearing voices and have begun to carry on full conversations and I've lost track of reallity and when I wake up so to speak I have no idea how or when I got there. When I am clear headed I can't shut my eyes for the bright flashing lights and constant communication that takes place in my head. I honestly feel like I'm a guest inside my own head. I don't see a Dr or take meds any longer. I quit it all about 10 plus years ago and have controlled myself well and than it was like a switch went turned off. It came in a flash and its only getting worse. I don't feel comfortable talking with anyone about what is exactly going on with my mind. I don't know where else to turn but I'm hopeful this may shed some light on helping me figure this out before I am lost inside myself permently. When this all began my wife listened and one day I saw a message she sent to a friend of hers stating I was in the middle of a "pity party" and she is tired of it. I asked her about it and it was my fault for reading her private message. And now she is pissed that I can't open up about what's going on. I lost the one person I could be completely transparent with. I have shared with a few on here which shocks me. And now I post for all of you. But I'm starting to get scared. The few moments of true clarity I have are becoming less.
