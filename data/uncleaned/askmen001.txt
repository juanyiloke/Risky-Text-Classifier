Boss is a sneaky bitch2015-04-01, 06:28 PMI am seriously upset about current events. I work for an agency under the umbrella of information technology but for the past 8 years I have been involved with crash data collection and bringing the imaging of our documents into the 21st century. Half the house is law enforcement, then the dmv and then us civilians who support them.I have been working on a project for a good year and a half close to 2 years to turn our mailroom into an all digital process scanning the documents as they come in so they can move through our new system without moving paper all over the department. I have put in hours and hours completely redone all the units, workflow, everything.....we went into production in February and while there are a few things wrong.....which is to be expected because we completely blew up the whole department.ÊNow things are starting to wind down and most of the kinks have been worked out which were mostly a result of all the dirty laundry that gets aired when you go all digital.....cant hide things anymore.My boss who hasn't really gave a shit has decided she is now interested and has basically came in the last two weeks and taken over basically everything I have been handling even tho she knows nothing about any of it and is getting with one of the other supervisors under her and they are making decisions and changes about the areas I manage and then telling me what I am going to do,ÊShe is also taking credit for all my work which I am not liking at all even tho when we have been meeting alone she has said nobody could have taken this on and did what I have.,The main project manager and many of the others just ignore her because they know but there is nothing I can do about her making changes and telling me to do things that should not be done.I was supposed to get a promotion with all this since I took on more work and more people but I found out today not only has she started micromanaging my life, I am not getting anything out of it.ÊI am so upset about the way things are going, she said I take things too personal and I need to learn to be tougher....I take my work personally and I have done this before and know what works and she is going to screw things up.I have started having panic attacks which I have not had since I divorced and I am in tears after I get home or when I close my door over the way she keeps talking to me.I have 30 years in and a good reputation and an old boss is trying to get a position created for me where she just moved to which I told her I would take if she did and I am planning on going to a head hunter and getting completely out of govt but what do I do in the meantime?
