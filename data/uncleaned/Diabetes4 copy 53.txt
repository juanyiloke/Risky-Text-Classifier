Hello AgainHello everyone, here I am ,like a bad penny , turning up again.I hope you all had a good Christmas and didnt come off your diet too much.Its ages since I last logged in, what a time its been, first I had a bad cold & cough , which  went to my chest, resulting in a very bad night  of tight chest ,coughing & vomiting.I rang the emergency number in the morning  & was told an ambulance would be with me soon, I was adamant , no way was I going to Hospital , but the 2 nice ambulance men persuaded me to go for a check up,assuring me that I would be allowed home  afterwards, wrong I was kept in for 9 days ,as tests showed Id had a slight heart attack [ wonder if I can sue them for false promises lol.]After being prodded with thermometers/B.P machines/ B.tests  +angiogram I was finally allowed home feeling exhausted. Just a week after my return a large mole on my arm started bleeding,so another vist to G.P. then to Hospital dermatology dept., where a lovely young Dr  kept up a cheerful chatter while removing it. I cannot complain about the treatment I have received any where , there is a lot of bad reports about Hospital /G.P services ,but I have been extremely lucky  with what I have had and I am grateful to be  at home & celebrate Christmas with my son.My BG seems fairly stable now,usually under 10, tho' a few times it has been 13. Oddly soon after my angiogram it went up to 17 ,yet just before 2 tests were  6+.,as I hadnt had anything to eat  since  before the eariler test Ive no idea why it went so high.. Wishing you all  a Very Happy New Year ,Good Health & Happiness
