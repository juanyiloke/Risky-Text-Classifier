i just realised something about the fight or flight response in schizophreniamaybe this has been said before but the best way i can describe it is....imagine you were a rabbit caught in the headlights and you have a spit second to reactbefore you are run over, you either run away or stay where you are.but what if those 2 seconds while thinking about what to do were extended into a lifetimei believe or i think i believe that we may neither be fighting nor fleeing, we are still thinking what to do in daily life situation.our body is reacting to danger but our mind is sort of in limbo thinking will i or won't i?kind of in shock about things we cannot control, my body is all tense most of the time, i try and relax but its not easy and i don't fully relax (apart from tonight first time in ages)i am hoping i am in the process of fleeing now, hoping i am getting ready to run away, away from all this crap at 100mph.
