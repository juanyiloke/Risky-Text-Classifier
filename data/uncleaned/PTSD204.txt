Has anyone had PTSD symptoms suddenly return?by Geeky_of_Borg » Sat May 23, 2015 7:27 amMany years ago, I used to suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, etc., which were related to my abusive childhood. It sort of made sense that they happened when they did, since I was newly an adult & had just gotten out of the abusive situation. Once I was no longer in survival mode 24/7, all the symptoms started appearing.Some 20 years later, I'm having flashbacks and nightmares again. I can't for the life of me think of what set me off this time. It's all the same stuff--childhood things. I've been out of my childhood home for ages, and I thought the PTSD was gone. It's all a little scary and I'm wondering if I'm not losing my mind. Has this ever happened to anyone else?
