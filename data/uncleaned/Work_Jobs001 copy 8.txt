Change in contract - can I push back?________________________________________Hi I've been successful in a recent promotion in work. Private sectorNo increase in money involved but as it is a higher role, they want me to sign a new contract. I have been here for 7 years. One change in the contract is that my standard notice period increases from 4 weeks to 3 months. I am not keen on this change. Do I have grounds to push back? Worried it may be seen that I will try to leave soon, which I may decide in next 6 months. I Just feel the new contract benefits the employer and not me the employeeThanks in advance
