i love pensioners :)

Ok i am  not old and i shouldnt be on here. i was actually looking for informations. I am actually 24 and coming from a big family we were always taught to look after our elders.My grandfather had passed away two years ago and because i was estranged from my family they did not alow me to see him duing his ilness. Ever since he passed i have had a gaping hole in my heart and upset i could not be there at his last moments. Anyway ever since i have wanted to do something for pensioners.  
Pensioners rock! It was my grandfather and grandmother that taught me all the secret recepies,held me when i was upset and taught me about life. I love pensioners and i feel in todays societys they are not valued. Instead looked upon as a burden , i regularly speak to pensioners and love thir stories,wisdom e.c.t and really feel us youngsters can learn something. 
I feel sad when i hear of old people living in care homes they should be in the centre of everyhome. treated preciously ,as they say old is gold 
I want to do someting for pensioners. Any thoughts? i was thinking of setting up a social website that is for elders.i also wanted to volunteer in a care home just to chat to old people and give them time.
