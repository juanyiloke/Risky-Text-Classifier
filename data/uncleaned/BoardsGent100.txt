(Fat) Mens ClothesIt really pisses me off when i try to buy clothes in any of the decent brand shops. I've long since stopped going into Jack Jones and the like. The biggest size in jeans they do is normally 36" but at a push 38" and the tops and t-shirts usually are L but even if you find an XL it usually fits like a M. I dont really want to have to resort to internet shopping.I really feel like the employees are lookng at me like 'wtf is he doing in here? hes not the type of customers we want'The only shop ive found other than Dunnes that has decent sizes is Burtons.what do you fellow fat bastids do in this situation??
