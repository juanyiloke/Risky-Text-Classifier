Awaiting PET scanHiIve been reading this site for the last couple of weeks and decided to pluck up the courage to post. Im 67 next week.About a month ago I started to cough up blood. Went to the Doc who sent me for a chest xray. The Xray showed a mass on my left lung. On Tuesday I went for a CT scan and had an appointment on Wed with the consultant who said that it may or may not be cancerous but because I was a smoker it probably was. He said that provided it hadnt spread anywhere else it could be surgically removed.I am going for a PET scan next Friday to determine if the cancer is anywhere else.The consultant will get the results by the following Tuesday.At the moment I am fearing the worst but hoping for the best
