Safelet-would you get it?Today I read an interesting article in Metro, in which a father who was concerned about his daughter going clubbing on her own(she lives in Amsterdam, NL) and wanted to find a way to keep her safe. He invented a device called a " Safelet", a bracelet with two buttons on it: one to alarm " guardians" (people who are programmed into the bracelet in case of emergency) and one to contact police. Location is transmitted to police and family and she can talk to them to let them know what's going on. It doesn't stop there though, you can also submit an sos to people nearby, creating a network of "guardians" to women in distress.The Safelet is not availabel yet, but is estimated to be released in NL around September. It looks quite stylish and you wouldn't know it's real purpose when you saw it.If the threads in the ladies lounge are anything to go by, one would think that women aren't safe anywhere, constantly shouted at, regular victims of random abuse both verbally and physically I've fortunately haven't encountered much of it myself because I don't go out much but some of the stories here are really shocking.One the one hand I think that all of the things invented and actions taken to keep women safe are wonderful, yet sometimes I think it also creates a rift: all men are percieved as evil and perverted and women their victims. So things like the safelet: are they just feeding this notion that danger is always present for a woman out on the streets or are they really really necessary. And if they became available in Ireland, would you get one? Would it make you feel safer? Should a male version be invented also? What do you ladies think?
