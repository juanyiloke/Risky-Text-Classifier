Eating DisordersI was talking to a few friends today about eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia mostly) today. I'm a teenager at an all girls school and can honestly say I've never intentially set out with the goal of losing weight through unhealthy practices. However, out of the group of girls I'm closest with, I'm probably the only one who has never had an eating disorder of some description. It seems to be considered "normal" almost for teenage girls to hurt themselves physically and emotionally to gain their "ideal figure". I'm often baffled when talking to people who have struggled with eating disorders and still can't get my head around why anyone would do that to themselves. It's also so much worse when you're told that their ideal goal is your body!! (Happened to me on several occassions) It's obviously today's society and projection of beauty which the media puts out that's having this affect on my friends. I'm also friends with a lot of other people in other schools and it seems the situation is the same everywhere you go!ÊMy question is how many of you out there have either had an eating disorder or known somebody with one? And also if you know somebody with one what's the best way to approach trying to help them?Edit: Just sitting here thinking more about my friends, I can truly see how fcuked up some of their attitudes to weight and food are. Some will go days without eating, go out at the weekend, down a bottle of wine or a naggin (which they don't seem to realise has plenty of calories) without a mixer or else only with diet coke. Their bodies simply can't handle the drunk without any food in their systems and they just end up vomiting more. Btw, I'm only posting this as the girls in question are quite open with their problems to me. I do not intend to undermine their privacy in anyway, I'm really just trying to see some sense in the situation.
