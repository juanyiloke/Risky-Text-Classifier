  I finally had a friend to hang out withAn old friend called me today and asked me if I wanted to hang out. It was cool to catch up cuz I havent seen him for like a year. I was really suprised anybody still wanted to hang out with me, but it was nice having some company for a change. We just chilled had some beers and played Rockband 3. He said to hit him up again cuz he wants to hang out and he is gonna be moving away in a couple months. If at least one person wanted something to do with me thats alright, I thought all my old friends thought I was just a big loser and never wanted to talk to me again.
