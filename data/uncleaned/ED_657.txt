Struggling.Sorry to post lovelies, I'm just really struggling with my ED ATM &could use some support.I've had an ED since I was 12-13.ÊPast few months, it's been getting worse and worse.I'm purging daily, not able to keep hardly anything down, when I do I make sure it's low in calories & keep myself under a certain amount of calories a day (I won't disclose numbers, obviously!), I've lost quite a bit of weight in a short space of time, my thoughts are extremely distorted, I'm obsessing over calories & food 24/7, I'm spending most of my money on binge food leaving me in both debts & taking out loans impulsively, and so on.I have been referred to ED services but there is a chance they won't take me my therapist said due to funding problems in my area and places in the services as it is very limited.I'm struggling....a lot.I also have severe M.E & other health problems, which my ED is making ten times worse.I just could do with some support...advice...a hug?
