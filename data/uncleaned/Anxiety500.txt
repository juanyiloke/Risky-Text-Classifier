always afraid of planning aheadFor as long as I can remember I have had this intense anxiety about planning ahead. I know that this mostly has to do with my hypochondria over myself and my loved ones. I always have this dark cloud hanging over my head and worry that my plans will always be ruined by some catastrophic disaster. Throughout the years I have let fun plans slip through my fingers just because I've been so afraid of planning ahead. Now I'm getting ready to attend a destination wedding in a few months and I can't bring myself to purchase the ticket. It's expensive (but at a good price point), and will only go up from here. I keep feeling that if I buy the ticket, the universe is going to somehow throw a wrench in my plans and I'll have to cancel it/not get my money back. I know this is a terrible unhealthy way to feel, but the thing is, this has happened to me on multiple occasions with other trips. Do you ever feel sometimes that you are just not meant to win? On the surface, I consider myself a relatively successful person, but sometimes I wonder if maybe happiness is just not meant for me and that I'll never be as carefree as other people.
