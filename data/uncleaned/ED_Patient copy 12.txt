Distorted body image...?Two weeks ago I was discharged from the hospital due to low heart rate and low weight.  People say that I'm too skinny -- the doctors, my family, even some friends -- but my perception of my body changes all the time.  Like sometimes I look in the mirror and think that I am too skinny, but five minutes later I might be wearing different clothes or something and I'll think I look completely fine!  I know that distorted body image is when extremely underweight people see themselves as overweight, but I just see myself as normal-looking, not overweight.  Has anyone experienced something similar?  Sometimes I think that maybe my thinking that I look normal is due to distorted body image, but other times I think that maybe I really am normal, and people are just making a big deal out of nothing.  I mean, my mom is the one who comments on my body the most, but of course she's bound to do that -- because she's my mom!  Some people say I look totally normal - not even a little bit too skinny.  So I'm confused.  And if I do have distorted body image...is there a physiological reason for that?  Are there certain connections in my brain that just aren't working?  Thanks.
