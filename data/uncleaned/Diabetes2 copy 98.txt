Hi, I have had type 2 diabetes for just over a year now...   Hi,I have had type 2 diabetes for just over a year now and have come to terms with it. I take 1 x 500mg Metformin, 1 x 40mg Simvastatin and 1 x 75mg dispersible asprin tabs daily. My diabetic care started off quite well, with blood tests and a review. But now mt surgery seems to have lost interest. I have not had a blood test or any review for about 8 months. My review date came and went in November this year. A friend goes to a different surgery and gets regular 6 mobthly checks and a yearly review. He is contacted by letter inviting him to book up for these checks. My surgery does none of this. Should I get told when my check/review is due or is it up to me to ask? This lack of care is making me depressed. Maybe I should change my surgery? :ill::ill:
