I am an Idiot!Managed to get all the way to work (1.5 hour commute) and toil away for another hour and a half befopre checking my blood this morning, was a bit surprised to find it was 15.9 so I went to do a correction and......no pump!I'd taken it off for my shower this morning and not put it back on   so followed a 3 hour round trip home and back to get it, surprisingly I wasn't any higher when I got home thank when I left my desk, probably due to the exercise of rushing to the station!Please tell me other people have done this?
