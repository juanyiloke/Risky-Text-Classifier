Depression And Exercise?I have a terrible relationship with exercise.I struggle to find motivation to do it. I know it's supposed to help depression but it's always been an incredibly daunting chore to me even when I was in a much better state of mind. Instead of feeling good about the workout I always felt frustrated I had to do it again in a day or two. I tend to manage about 2 months max before I give up as no matter how hard I work I've never seen any results or felt any better for it.Aside from being very depressed and struggling with anxiety, I'm also at the heaviest I've been in my life and need to lose weight. I'm 5'6'' and 220 pounds (168 cm and 100kg). It sounds worse than it looks, I think my fat is very dense or something. I don't feel out of shape but I can't let it get any worse and it's affected my self-esteem. Anyway, I hate exercise so much I'm finding excuses all the time.Has anyone overcome or is struggling with a similar issue?
