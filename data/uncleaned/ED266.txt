ÊEarly weight gainHi I am new to this forum but my family just can't talk to me about all this anymore which I understand completely but I just need to not be alone in this so this is where I be turned.ÊAnyway my issue is I've been on the waiting lost for my first appointment at the eating disorder clinic for a weeks now but I just couldn't carry on like this anymore, I've gone two years now eating a very low amount of calories a day so decided something needed to be done. However now I feel like I need to stop untill i get there help even though that's going completely backwards when am trying to get my body used to food again. Basically I've gained what I believe is a large amount of weight in two weeks how can this be normal !!!!! I am freaking out and can't even look at my stomach I swear it's bigger and rounder and puffier than ever! The main thing that has tipped me over the edge and sent me into complete melt down is my sister persuaded me to have a pizza with her last night ! I had eaten very little that day so I said ok since am trying to introduce food I gained weight !!!! How is that possible I am now terrified .ÊHow have I gained so much clearly my body can't handle it I need to start restricting again or I am going to be massive by the time I get my appointment at the clinic and I won't need there help anymore. Do I try to cut back again ? Has anyone got experience with this ? In desperate need of advice guys
