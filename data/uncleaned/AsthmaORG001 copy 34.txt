Persistent attacks Persistent attacks I have a question if anyone can help, or relate too...Since christmas I have had problems with my asthma.I've had lots of colds/viruses which always acts as a trigger.I was switched from becotide to seretide, which has subsequently increased to 250mg three times a day. And I keep having courses of steroids.But the asthma never gets completely better. I still have to use ventolin several times a day.Things become manageable for about two weeks, then it starts up all over again.My gp wants me to have an asthma review with the nurse, but says I need about six weeks after finishing steroids or I will get a false reading, which will make things seem better than they are.I feel like I'm on a loop, going round and round, and unable to stop it.I'm struggling to walk more than a couple of minutes without being breathless and wheezes. I'm currently on prednisilone, and things are improving, but never get to a really good point. I told the Dr I saw last week, and whilst she gave a sympathetic look, and suggested i taper of the pred ..6 for five days, then four, then two, I feel like this isn't being dealt with.I'm getting frustrated and upset, as I don't know how to get things sorted.I have an appointment with my usual gp first April so will raise these issues then.Does anyone have similar roundabout they are on, or any ideas how to get of it.Thanks for listening
