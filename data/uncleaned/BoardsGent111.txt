Double standards at MTV awardsAnyone else find all this a bit irritating?Firstly, if a man walked over to a female actor and exposed parts of her body like that, there would be absolute hell to pay. So why is it ok for Rita to do that? I guess he didn't look too annoyed about it and took his shirt off completely, but how was he supposed to react?ÊThat leads me to the second thing that I find annoying. The fact that there was a "Best Shirtless Performance" award being given out. Clearly this is just a male award. Imagine an award for "Best Cleavage Performance" for the girls. The whole thing is just sexist, and when I hear all the screams from the audience, it pisses me off. Imagine a crowd of guys hooting and baying at a female on the stage like that, it would be condemned.Obviously Zac Efron is ok with this because he turned up to accept his award, and went along with the fun and games. Is this because men haven't traditionally had to fight against being objectified in films and the media in the same way women have?
