ÊAltered States, Spirits, Aliens & GodMy experiences of 'psychosis/delusions' has involved a lot of content concerning spirits, aliens, the devil & god, & a lot of content that could be considered to be in 'conspiracy' areas.ÊBefore the first major psychotic episode some 25 years ago, i was looking into a lot of fringe areas. Since going through a lot of psychosis, & having been a bit more stable over the past 10 years, i've looked into a lot of what other people have said/are saying on all these areas.ÊIt is very hard to find an answer to some of my experiences. i don't think i'll find a categorical answer - There are so many potential explanations. It would be good to be able to let go of the past more, & i have made progress.Êi don't know exactly what categorical answers there are to certain questions? But i have always sought out a more complete picture on everything. i think it's been the nature of the experiences i've had that has motivated me to do that.Êi've always wondered what 'schizophrenia/psychosis' really is & what the nature has been on having such experiences in severely altered/non-ordinary states? i do think that there is a lot more to it all than 'just' a 'wonky brain'.Unknown/fringe areas are a taboo subject in many ways, but i've been very motivated to try & discuss it all. A lot of people seem very reluctant to go into too much depth in discussing & exploring such areas, but i feel it can be healthy to do so.Êi feel the content of these experiences of 'psychosis' should be discussed & explored. How do other people feel & what do they think about it all?
