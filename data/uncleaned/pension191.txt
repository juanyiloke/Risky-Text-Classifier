False teeth.In Feb my wife had to have all her teeth removed due to gum disease but the dentist says it is still too early to take an impression fourths months later and yet I have heard of some people having them fitted straight away. She gets a bit depressed  :-\sometimes about having no teeth all this time and I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and could they offer any words of encouragement to her?Thank You.
