Êhow to handle not exercising while inpatient? !hi all, in a few weeks I will be going in patient for symptom interruption, namely binging and purging, 3 to 4 weeks. I will be able to earn passes on which I can have a short walk now and then. I am NOT, truthfully a compulsive exerciser, I do a little yoga and a 5 km run three times a week and that's it. However that said I'm terrified at the thought of having almost 0 true activity or fitness for that long. While eating a full meal plan. My exercise a few times a week is very stress relieving to me also! !!.ÊHow have other people cope with not being able to exercise?Ê(I am NOT under weight. Thte policy and passes is the same for everyone except bed bound...)Also I have to be honest and say I'm tempted to do a few sneaky things like planks in my bed and lunges if i can lol pretty tame though. Scary to gain extra weight with no outlet.any suggestions on any of the above? Thank you very much
