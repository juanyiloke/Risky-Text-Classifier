This is beginning to really hack me off! Am sat outside a cafe drinking my lemon and ginger tea whilst DS (5) nibbles his sandwich a microgram at a time.DS doesn't eat ham sandwiches or cheese sandwiches (all that was on offer), but the very accommodating chef very kindly offered to make him a tuna sandwich. White or brown? When told that the brown was lovely and had some grains in, I had to turn it down in favour of the white. DS does eat brown bread (I always only have wholemeal at home), but has recently started taking exception to "bits" in it.So out comes the sandwich, but there is sweet corn in the sandwich. I knew this was going to be trouble. Of course DS DOES eat sweet corn (at least in the homemade begetable pasta sauce I make), but has taken exception to it in sandwiches.This is getting ridiculous. I try t accommodate DS, but really this is getting too much. A few weeks ago he also turned his nose up at the sandwich because there was a bit too much mayonnaise in it. Ok, I could scrape the extra Mayo off (I think that I did on that occasion). Or I could go through and pick out every bit of corn (I didnt this time), but I am getting fed off and just see this getting worse.DS is generally a good eater (all types of fish, meat, chicken, good balanced diet with veg, all types of fruit, rice, pasta, sushi, olives etc), but sure a sandwich out should be an easy meal? Ok, I know I could bring and picnic (and some times do), but can't do that all of the time.The consequences of not eating half the sandwich (two small quarters) are nothing else until dinner (which is about 6.30). Nine of the rest of his lunch box (Pom bears, fruit, jelly tots) and no ice cream later.
