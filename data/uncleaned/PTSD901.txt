ÊTrigger Warning!!Warning trigger!!Okay so anyone else get this, it's really distressing me as I don't know why it happens, but say you have radio on or tv, or there could be random people talking in background... say your totally engrossed in something else and not listening what so ever, and then keywords crop up on the tv/radio people talking that make you stop look listen, words for me that always stop me in my tracks are paedophile, rape, molestation etc, but I never hear what they say before they mention these words... why does this happen?? It happened again whilst typing this post the word paedophile came up....hell knows what else they said on the tv....
