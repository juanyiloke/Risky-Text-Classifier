  Hope for depressed soulsHello:) Im new to this forum. I understand that it caters to people from all over the world. Im fr Singapore, small country in Asia with the 2nd highest GDP in the world. Here, we focus greatly on grades and society is cruely competitive. I studied 18 yrs of life(nvr ever had a date) just for a degree...but due to health probs I flunked my As(equvalent of SATs but much harder). I went into severe depression but 4 months. I cknow thats each persons depression it is unique, brought on my diff factors and causes, but there are definitely similaities like death thoughts, lost of hope, faith, love, loss of sleep, appetite etc. Heres the thing. Im actually fully recovered from my depression. There IS hope, as cliche as it sounds, even if u have prob heard it numerous times. Maybe, just maybe my story can inspire you just a bit, a slowly bit by bit, u can help yrself out of it. I really understand the pain and crushing force of depression. And i rly want to help ppl who are in it.
