Got a verbal warning at work what do I do?2013-05-04, 03:09 AMI received a verbal warning at work, should I sign the documentation that my boss gave to me about this? Remember this only a VERBAL warning and not a writtern warning. Also, my boss said that because it is merely a verbal one that it WILL NOT go to HR.However, I'm receiving this warning for something that used to be perfectly acceptable to do. I will describe it like this. I have a list of assigned work to do. If I couldn't get to certain "appeals" l it was acceptable for other workers to take these appeals away from someone and work on them anyways. They would still get credit for that work and I would not be faulted.However, it's no longer acceptable to do this but no one ever stated that it's NOT ok anymore when it used to be ACCEPTABLE in previous quarters.How should I react to my verbal warning?
