Fear of physical symptoms Ê10    I avoid certain situations as I'm so terrified of revealing my physical symptoms.My whole body will start to shake & my voice quivers.It's held me back all these years.I feel so embarrassed by it.Missed out on so many social events etc....I'll find some excuse to avoid the event.I think about future events for  /weeks on end.I'm on propranolol, but don't really see a significant improvement.I've used alcohol as a crutch, but know that's not the answer.Just can't seem to think rationally.Any advice would be gratefully received.Thank you.
