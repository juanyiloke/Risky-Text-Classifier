The Engagement PressureI'm sure this has probably been discussed before but I really just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this.ÊI've been going out with my boyfriend nearly 4 years, we're very happy together, buying a house and everything's going well.ÊWe know that someday we want to get married but it's not something that we discuss with a set timeline or anything.ÊOnce we got past the 3 year mark and other friends started to get engaged I've noticed that lots of friends have started asking me when do I think he'll propose.ÊWhenever we go away anywhere I can see people looking at me before I go with this look as if to say "he's definitely going to pop the question" and then expectantly looking at my ringless finger upon our return.ÊEither that or they bluntly will say it to me, maybe he'll propose this time or God that would be a great city to get a ring in!!ÊI'm starting to get really annoyed with this and don't understand how people think it's ok to be so blunt about these things!ÊHas anyone else experienced this?
