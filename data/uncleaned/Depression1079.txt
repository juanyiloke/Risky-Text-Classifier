What is the purpose of this all? Life, the world.First post.I'm 23, female. I've had depression as long as I can remember but lately it has become almost unbearable. I have seen therapists in the past but I feel like I am not myself and just say what I think they want to hear, I struggle with face to face communication about myself.My mind always goes back to the thought, what is the purpose of all of this? Life? The world? We live and die, we are smaller than a grain of sand to time. It will continue to go on without us, so what is the purpose to be here right now?Ê
