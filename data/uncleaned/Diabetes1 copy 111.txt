Antibodies in the bloodFirst of all I want to apologise if my message is too long and u get but I am sorry if this has been repeated.I have been a type 1 diabetic since June 1994 and I had a kidney transplant on March 17th 2004.I went for my normal transplant checkup on 6 January 2015 and surprising I got a letter in the post to go back to the hospital last month, whereas I normally go back for checkup every 4 months. They had found via the results that there were antibodies in my blood. Basically I was wondering if the antibodies in my blood could have made my blood sugars go low so I had to change my ratios with regard to my carb counting or not.Please reply back and let me know please
