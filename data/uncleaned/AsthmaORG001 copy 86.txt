Fed up!! It's time to double! Rant Alert! [+1] I am thorougly fed up of not being able to breathe properly!!!!!A thought occurred to me tonight - how am i supposed to have any hope of control when i'm now on half the dose that didn't control me before!!!I know the theory is that the particles in the new inhaler are "superfine" so more gets in and you need less but it's not working with me!!3 times in the last 4 days my asthma has kicked off randomly without any provocation!and it comes to something when you can't even breathe enough for a piano lesson :-( I had to take my inhaler part-way through and a few times Helen (my teacher) asked was i ok, she also commented at the end "you're defintely not yourself"i've now been on the reduced dose for slightly over 2 weeks and REALLY feling iti've decided the nurse's "2-3 weeks" is over and i'm doubling the Fostair!!!sorry to rant but i either want to rant or cry - or maybe both!I nearly broke down in my lesson, not that that would've been unusual but normally it's as a result of frustration at not being able to play something, not at not being able to breathe!
