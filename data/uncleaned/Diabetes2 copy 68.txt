Blood sugar levels to high?   Hello, I need some advice on what to do. My sister has diabetes type 1 and has a blood sugar meter to check her blood sugar levels so a few days ago she asked if she could check mine and when she did it was 12 which I was shocked about as the normal level is meant to be around 4 to 7. She waited a few hours and checked it again and it was 11 so it was still really high. I have lost a bit of weight recently but I haven't done anything out of the ordinary or changed my diet recently, Im 23 a male and im 6'2 and weight 13-14 stone and I'm stocky as I like to lift weights. I sometimes have felt shaky or sweaty and light headed through out the days but not to often and have put this down to not eating enough through out that day. A week later (being today) I saw my sister again and she checked my blood for me again and this time it was 15 and then an hour or so later went to 16 she also checked my girlfriends blood and hers was 4 and we had eat/drank the same all day and had done nothing different from each other and my sisters meter told me to check my ketones but I wasnt able to do this.I'm just wondering on what to do, I don't think I'm diabetic as I saw what my sister went through before she was diagnosed and I am nothing like she was as she was really sick, so I'm just a little confused is blood sugar levels only linked with diabetes or could it be something else? I know the first thing I will be advised to do is to go to my GP but I suffer from anxiety and find i really difficult to do this sort of thing so I just wanted to get a bit of advice. If anyone can help or offer advice that would be great,Thanks.
