sabbatical from work?Hi All,Has anyone ever asked their boss for a years sabbatical? At my Doctors suggestion, Ive made an appointment to go in and have a chat with my boss as I'm still off sick at the mo from Hysterectomy, With hubby having the bowel cancer stage IV, our prognosis is as we were told 'being very benelovement, 2 years max'. We were also told he needs a lot of luck. As you can imagine we want as much time as possible together and go on holidays for a year (which will fly by) whilst Kev is feeling well. He's on his 9th Chemo next Friday and doing well. I can hear everyone saying, stage IV, you can live for years but tbh if it is 2 years max, we dont want to regret not doing anything together. Im c******g it going to ask my boss but something I must do. A 'sabbatical' would save me having to pack my job in or getting sacked and at the end of the year, I would still have a job.
