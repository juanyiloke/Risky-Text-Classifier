PSA rising after surgery I had a total prostatectomy in March of this year. After surgery my PSA level was 0.2 and my surgeon said that could be just benign cells left behind as the prostate cancer was entirely contained and clear margins.  My lymph glands were not removed as they were not accessible with the type of operation I had.Recent tests now show that my PSA level has risen to 1.3 which is a real worry. I have an appointment with radiotherapy on Monday and I am not expecting good news. Has anyone else experienced such a high increase in PSA so shortly after surgery?  My gleason score before and after surgery was 3+4.
