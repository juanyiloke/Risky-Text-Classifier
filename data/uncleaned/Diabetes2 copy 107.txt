He has always controlled his diabetes fairly well and I can count on one hand the number of times he has had a serious hypo in the 15 years we have been together. However, we have recently taken up going to a health spa and he is exercising vigoursly for about 1.5 hours 3 x per week in the gym and this is having a dramatic effect. Despite lowering insulin levels on the days he exercises, and the day after, and drinking an isotonic drink during exercise &amp; regularly checking his blood sugar levels, his levels are all over the place. This is making him feel very anxious about the possibility of having a hypo in public and the side effects that he used to experience when blood sugar levels were low, now seem to be the same when sugar levels are high and low so it's very confusing &amp; difficult to manage. Has anyone got any advice or similar experiences?
