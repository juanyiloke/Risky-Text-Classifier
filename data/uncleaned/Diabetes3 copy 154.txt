Pneumonia JabsFor anyone who thinks getting a pneumonia jab is a waste of time you may want to reconsider.I have just returned to work this week after 3 weeks off due to a chest infection turning to pneumonia. I had the pneumonia jab about 10 years ago and it probably saved me from a stay in hospital as it lessened the severity of my symptoms.I speak from previous experience of having pneumonia many years ago when I was a fair bit worse than this time.I would certainly urge people to get the jab if they can as it can make a big difference.
