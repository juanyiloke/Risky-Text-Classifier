Good News on HbA1cI went to the hospital today and got the result of my latest HbA1c blood test.  It is now down to 44.  I saw the Registrar again this time and she was very pleased how well I had done.  She was surprised that I am not on any medication for my diabetes and have done it by diet alone.  I told her that I had gone against the diet advice of my GP and health centre nurse and was following a very low carb and high fat diet.  There then followed a big discussion about my cholesterol and I told her that I had stopped taking my statins.  I was only on 20mg anyway.  My last cholesterol reading, taken in June, was 5.  She thought that was high and wanted me to get it down to 4.  I told her that I had read somewhere on the web that 5 was about right.  She said it might be all right for some pople but not for a diabetic.  There then followed an even longer discussion.  Oh how I wished I had taken some notes with me!  In the end she said that it was my choice and that she would add a cholesterol test to the form for my HbA1c and liver function blood test, due in 4 months time.  She then said she would take my blood pressure.   It had been high and this was the reason that I had been attending the hospital this past year.  My GP was unable to get my bp under control and the diuretics I had been on for many years were causing sodium to be retained and potassium to be expelled.  I was sure my bp would be high after my confrontation with her, but fortunately, it was normal.My husband said he was surprised how I stood up to the Registrar but he thought I argued my point well.
