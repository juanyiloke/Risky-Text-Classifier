Êfrom the perspective of a friend...one of my best friends of all time struggled for a long time with accepting what she looked like, always criticizing her shape and figure and weight. recently, though she has grown distant from me, i've noticed she hardly eats, she counts the calories on EVERYTHING, and she lost quite a bit of weight.Êas i said, she isn't exactly close with me right now, but i'm really worried, as a person who has struggled with eating issues in the past, and i want to reach out to her before it's too late. she's becoming depressed and withdrawn and i just want to help her out.Êwhat do i do?
