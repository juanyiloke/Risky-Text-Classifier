CannabisWith yet another major factory found in Donegal valued at €1m+, isn't it time the irish government think about how much money they could revenue each year by regulating it. After all the only people that are making money from it are the low life criminals who are on the DOLE and live the lavish lifestyle. The government will never ever win the war against cannabis anywhere in the world, simply because its a form of medicine and serves a lot of medicinal relief. Just cannot get my head around how its ok to regulate alcohol and cigarettes and yet they are doing a heck of a lot more damage to ourselves and with the booze its simply damaging or society.Picture this....Legalize Cannabis so patients have a safe source of medicine Legalize Cannabis and do away with alcohol = Less Garda needed at weekends to stop all the fighting after clubs and pubsLegalize Cannabis to stop funding the criminalsLegalize Cannabis for another source to fund bail outLegalize Cannabis and we would see an increase of tourists.Legalize Cannabis to stop the criminals stealing electricity from the grid.Realistically if it's done properly, there would be no downside to it.If anyone wishes to talk more then please contact me goodweed at live dot ie
