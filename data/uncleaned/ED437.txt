ÊI think I'm over-excercisingSo I am (and have been for a long time) at a point where I'm weight restored and at a much heavier weight than I would like, but I'm not truly completely recovered. I still use disordered behaviors a lot, and not at all happy with my body size or shape.I can't get to the gym most days, usually just on the weekends. But every time I go to the gym, I'll spend hours on the elliptical until my legs are throbbing. I know I can't say numbers, but I have a target number of calories to burn, and I feel like it doesn't count unless I hit that number before I leave.Last week I was able to spend more time at the gym than usual. I went four times in five days, and spent at least two hours there each time. When I got home yesterday, I was so tired I feel asleep in the car in my driveway. Now today, I worked a long day and so I can't go and I'm suddenly feeling panicked that I NEED to get moving or else my muscles will waste away to nothing and my stomach will just swell up massively big, and I'll wake up tomorrow with a totally different, messed up, body.Does this sound like an issue?
