 ÊTips For Binging?Hi.I'm posting this topic in search for help and support when it comes to binging. I do not purge, I simply binge. At times, I will sit down and eat one to two entire large bags of doritos (which will seem like a great idea at the time) then will instantly regret it. Almost every time after I binge, I will tell myself not to worry too much about it and that I will go back to eating normally again the next day (and I will for a day or two) but then I just go ahead and binge again.Does anyone have any tips or advice in regards to fighting off the urge to binge?
