A diabetic's odd case (1926)I wanted a better understanding of how injected insulin into subcutaneous fat was absorbed and metabolized since I had only a basic understanding of the process. I Googled my way to some resources and also found some interesting anecdotes during my search, one in particular about a patient diagnosed in 1926. Briefly, she had bad reactions at the injection sites, later she showed some insulin resistance but then became Hypoglycemic at unexpected times. She also suffered serious Ketoacidosis at one point and underwent rapid emergency treatment. Also the diet she was prescribed back in 1926 must have been a revelation! 50g protein, 55g Carb and 155g fat! (not a ratio advocated today by the powers that be for sure)For the case report go here:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1655368/Access the PDF file top left of above webpage.On the PDF page scroll down to bottom right of p1 for beginning of article and continue down to p2 for rest of article.Interesting!
