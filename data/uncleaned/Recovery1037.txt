Im getting betterHiya forum, I just wanted to say that I am getting better, I have found the parts I needed to fix myself, and for the first time in, well pretty much ever, I feel fine, I havent been really depressed in weeks, so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on this forum for your support, and a very big thank you to a certain someone, you have shown me what it is like to feel love, and to be loved, you have changed my life for the better :cuddle2:. So i may not be on this site as often as I used to, since I am on the road to recovery for now, its going to be a long road, but, I think I can make it, Im more complete than Ive ever been, I can finally find out who the real me is, Im looking forwards to that. But I couldnt have done it without the love and support of my friends, and everyone on this forum. So, thank you, you have saved me, thank you so much :biggrin:Pg 13
