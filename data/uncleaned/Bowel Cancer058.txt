Help please - Liver capsule painHi all,I've not been on the site much recently. Life was doing ok. I switched to a new drug, Regorafenib, in February and after four rounds and two scans, all was looking good. The tablets have few side effects, only one trip to hospital a month and most importantly, a relatively normal life for the family and I. Just over two weeks ago, the most recent scan even suggested some of the tumours in my lungs were decreasing. Fabulous.Then, out of no where, I suddenly developed some pain in my liver. It became gradually worse during the course of the day and by evening, I could barely move. Friday morning we went to hospital, who confirmed I had an infection in my bile duct in my liver and was put on a course of antibiotics, which I fortunately responded well to.After six days in hospital, I was allowed home. However, since coming home, the pain in my liver seems to have remained. I find walking, sitting, lying all difficult and am barely functioning a normal life. The children have in just two weeks seen their mum go from running around in legoland to not being able to get out of bed unassisted.I'm told the liver capsule pain is quite common, but wondered if anyone else had experienced it. If so. Does it start to fade - it came on so suddenly, seems really strange to now not be shifting. I'm meeting the palliative care team at the hospice today to discuss pain relief, as still not happy, but guess I could just do with a bit of reassurance and hope that this isn't the beginning of the end. Lucy starts school in sept and I can't bear the idea of not walking her to the school gates.Thanks Cx.
