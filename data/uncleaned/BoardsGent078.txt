Boys, Men and crying

I brought this up in the "Man up" thread, but a mod said it was the subject of another thread.

Do people think there is more pressure on males (boys and men) not to cry? (I do; for example, when somebody has died or because of a movie)

If so, do you think it's a good thing? I'm inclined to think extra pressure on boys and men is not a good thing.Ê

Where does the pressure come from, for boys and men?
Do many parents say "big boys don't cry" now or is that dying out?
