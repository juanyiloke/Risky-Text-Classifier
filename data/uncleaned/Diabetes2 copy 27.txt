Diagnosed Type One at the age of 54.  6  I've been a Type One diabetic for 10 years. I was diagnosed in the hospital on the brink of a coma. My blood had been checked in February of that year and everything looked fine. By April my eyesight changed from longsighted to short sighted; by May I was becoming thirsty all the time and by June my weight had dropped drastically. Not to mention extreme cramping in my legs in the morning.By the end of June I was in the hospital. There has been no history of diabeties in my family on either side. Up until then I was a relatively healthy 54 year old, the right weight for my height keeping up a heavy work load as a primary school teacher. I did have an underactive thyroid caused my Hashimoto's disease.The specilist at the hospital told me this is rare but has happened before. (I'm in Canada.) Everyone was totally surprised. My family and doctor most of all.I am finding it hard to find literature meant for cases like mine. Most type one contract the disease much earlier.Is there anyone that has had a similar experience?
