confused?!Hi I have never posted before but have been lurking in the background. I am confused as I thought this website was recovery based but it feels as though there is a lot of people who just want to talk about how terrible there life is they look for support but just don't take any of it on board. I'm currently in recovery and know that I have been in a terrible place before but don't think I have ever been graphic with anyone as some people are on here?? Maybe I'm talking out of place but I came on here to help me with the stage I am at and get some positive vibes but it seems some people can't see any positive at all.ÊI feel irritated but not sure that is is fair?? But I can't help it. Is this normal for this stage of recovery and as awful as it sounds I feel some people are just after a reply agreeing how terrible there life is which I don't think is helpful. I would like to use this site to get positive support but not sure if this is the right place to do it?
