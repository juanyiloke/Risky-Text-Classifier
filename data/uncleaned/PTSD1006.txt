There is no job description for the occupation "PTSD Caregiver", no orientation or on-the-job training; you are unceremoniously launched into your new role with all the subtlety of receiving a mule kick from a combat boot in the small of your back. Five days ago I was in uniform, five days ago I was an officer, I was the one in control. Today I feel like a lost hiker staring at a rain soaked map trying to decipher the least treacherous route to navigate us through unfamiliar territory, and if I lead us wrong there will be no rescue chopper, or search party with dogs and whistles responding to our dilemma. We are on our own. It is quite an eye opener and something I had not considered prior to my resignation, just how different I feel now I am home full time. Did my career really define who I was so completely? Can I satisfactorily be defined by the title Caregiver? What is so different about caring for my husband now that it's become a 24/7 obligation, not just during those times outside of work? So many new emotions and realizations to come to terms with.
