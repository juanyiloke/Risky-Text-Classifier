 Major Trigger!Some time ago, there was a married guy, seeking me out when ever I went to church. He was growing more and more needy and desperate each time he saw me. He is very bold and doesn't care who sees him. He repeatedly came up behind me (I never new when he was going to do this), he is very sneaky and fast in his approach, always catching me off guard! At first it didn't bother me, but I did wonder what he wanted; what his intentions were. It was puzzling to me, which spoke to me to be cautious around him. But, his intensity, his neediness grew and he became more and more agressive with me. He would swoop down on me, which always through off center!Well, I figured that my only out was to leave that church, and never go there again; which I did for a year. I thought that that would cool him off, it did not! In fact, he became even more desperate! He didn't just hug me once, now he was hugging me three times and even resorted to kissing me on my head (he is taller than I)!!! Right infront of his wife! I could see that she was very puzzled by his behavior just like I was.OK, so all of this became a major trigger for me, which triggered intense fear, panic, anxiety,etc. So much so that I quit my church and ran home to my safe place and hid away! I felt like I was being stalked, just like I was when I was a child (I was stalked by many molesters)! Well, this triggered all of my seriously bad memories, which came back like a raging torrent, it was overwhelming, it was frightening! Everything came back!  Now I will no longer go around people without my husband!Anybody here know anything about what this man was doing? If so can you explain it to me!?thank you for letting me rant.
