The Thousand Mile Stare *triggers*by Lucretius » Wed Dec 03, 2014 1:03 pmI've lived my life within the thousand mile stare. Believing the next wack around the head is going to kill me outright when you are aged 3 years old and upwards, kind of built a wall where my guard is never down and trust is nigh on impossible. Failed relationships, isolation and a lifetime feeling of suicidal thoughts and internal destruction.And yet somehow I learnt every other aspect in life myself. Build houses, compose music, write poetry, played sports absolutely everything I could throw at getting recognition from the one person that abused me as a kid..Now days my abuser has found God, he has repented to Jesus and has fully forgiven himself. Tells me he loves me and how clever and proud he is of me. Yet I look into his eyes and see the same scary look I used to see as a child, I know he is still in there...My present relationship is suffering. Apparently I should forgive him, or myself, but I can do neither. I blame him for being that weak to knock a child about when he knew inside hitting a child was seriously wrong. It never even crossed my mind to hit my 2 children when they came into my life. I just isolated myself from them because I had no clue how to teach them love. But I never taught them fear. And they understand where I came from, I was honest with them both from day one.Trust is missing within me, it's the main ingredient which was knocked out of me right from the start. I want to trust, and that means coming out of the thousand mile stare. Has anyone else managed to do this? And if so, How?
