CHARITIESPlease don't get me wrong, I give when and if I can,. But as a pensioner I have limited resourses as I am sure most of us have.Recently on our local TV station we were being told how our money was being spent on children in need. Up to this point I had been an enthusiastic contributor. However the article showed a group of still at school single mothers with their children. It proceeded to show how they were helping them get the education they obviously spurned when still at school an paying for their education and child care. So the conclusion was , we are supporting unmarried teenage mothers ! This is not what I thought the charity was for. After all isn't the State doing that already with our taxes ?Later on the One Show, as a result of Edwina Curry challenging a statement that there were starving people in the UK, they reported on a family, who looked far from starving were keeping a large Dog at the cost of £15 per week in food alone, & some Budgies. The lady ? was quite adamant that she needed food hand out parcels to survive. I would presume that as she appeared single with 2 children she would be claiming CSA working or not. Funnily enough they didn't seem to be able to get any of the Starving on to represent this assumption !I am loath to agree with Mz Curry and believe she is not right in her assumption,but I would concur that the BBC were not looking in the right place or hard enough. Try Pensioners ?I am wondering if I should support some of these charaties with  contributions ?Am I being disingenuous ? Over to my peers for your thoughts.
