 Please could someone help meHi, I feel an idiot writing this but I'm so confused and really need help. Iv been dieting for about a year now and have lost a lot of weight.My boyfriend is really worried and Iv tried everything to reassure him that I am fine as Iv not lost an extreme amount of weight in a short period of time but getting nasty verbal abuse from him, calling me names has really hurt me. He wants me to put weight on but I honestly don't no how to because my mind won't let me. I can't bare the thought of putting FAT on.So I finally decided to go to see the nurse at my doctors practice, just to see if my boyfriends concerns are real. So the nurse told me I had to put quite a bit of weight on to be healthy. She made me a doctors appointment for tomorrow (12/11/14) about being refered as she thinks I have a problem but I don't think I actually do. I no I'm underweight but I'm not drastically underweight and when I get really depressed I stuff myself while crying like a big fat baby! I go to the gym 4 times a week for an hour at a time unless I have an emotion eat in which case I exercise for 2 hours cos I feel so guily  I hope you all won't judge me because I am really at a low point in my life. Thank you for reading x
