Stress & bgAbout the same time as i hurt my back at the end of Aug life started to get very stress full starting with the 4 weeks i could hardly move with my back and as soon as that cleared i ended up with a nasty cold that turned in to a even worse cough and as most of you know from my past bad coughs they like to last a good month with me maxed out of meds This followed by my daughters boyfriend not getting paid from a few big jobs he had been doing (he works for him self) there for he was not able to pay his board money (he lives with us) so my money was already tight when child benefit decided that my girls did not quilfy for my money and just stopped it until i proved they were both in either school or full time college. At the same time my Nan died from a hypo with her bg been 0.5 I also at the time started having problems with my lower right wisdom tooth its impacted and growing in to my cheek giving me lots of pain so as you can see lots of stress now my bg was not to bad while this was going on my fasting bg did go from 6-7 range to 7.5-9 but the rest of the day was OK until 2 weeks ago that is fasting bg now 8-10 range pre meals anything from 8-13.9 and most nights pre bed 10-14 I don't test post meals i gave up doing that a long time ago as i was always back in range by the time my humolog had done its job and gone but found i was around 10-12 at 2 hrs but if i took any more humolog i was hypo at 4-5 hrs I have increased my basal by 20% in the last few weeks and about the same with my humolog so i don't under stand why when the stress has reduced a lot not fully gone but dropped by a good 75% why my bg has jumped up so much since not only that but my hip pain that had gone is now back and after seeing physio for that today he thinks my stress might have set that off too and i have to see him again in 2 weeks not 6 .
