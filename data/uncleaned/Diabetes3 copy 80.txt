Managing worryMy best plans to manage my worry over the future of my legs has been shaken up today. I had scans booked for 4 weeks to see if the drug I have been using has done anything towards helping my long term foot fractures heal. Today the scan appointments have been brought forward 2 weeks, usually that would be a good thing but I am worried sick about what the scans will show and what further actions and operations that will involve. I like knowing when I need to be brave.It is so hard not to let the thought of losing my leg-which is a very real outcome- overwhelm me with worry. I started cleaning the house as distraction therapy but had to abandon it due to going hypo.I need a low glucose requiring occupation to stop me from getting too scared and please, no more appointment changes!
