Islam4UK BannedBrown plays to the Media and somepeople who are not able to see thebigger picture, by banning.UK Governments decided that the UK wanteda multi-culture society. That we had the tolerancefor one.That may all be very well - until you start attackingother Countries and it affects someone inthe UK.There were or still are many slogans painted insome areas that say 'Kill Blair' 'Blair Liar' overthe lies that led to a huge amount of bloodshed.An example of feelings. I wouldn't want him killed,but without doubt he is a liar.But whatever happens 'Muslim must not come to mean Terrorist.'but Brown is fuelling that belief.
