Dammit CEA risingHiya to all you lovely people just wanted your thoughts on this.I have been stable and without treatment since last August but my test results today showed a rise in my CEA from 4 to 18 (when I was first diagnosed it was 657).The oncologist said I am not to worry lol but she wants me to have a Ct scan and a Pet scan immediately.Of course I'm thinking it's all starting up again and the very thought of chemo again makes me want to scream. Has anyone else been in this situation and what was the outcome? Also I have never had a Pet scan. What is it?I would really appreciate any comments / thoughts. Love to all of you Alwyn
