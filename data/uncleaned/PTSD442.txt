Êemotion/body based flashback/body memorymy flashbacks seem to be a lot more emotion and more body memories, i guess. i was wondering if anyone else experiences more of that than feeling like they are back at the event and seeing it.i struggle with dissociation too, so sometimes it gets very confusing so i don't know what is what, a flashback of some type or dissociation or maybe mixed. i tend to become very afraid out of nowhere and have no actual triggers a lot of the time (except stress is a big one).i always thought flashbacks had to be purely like you were reliving an event but realized they can also be emotion/body based yet not be able to really connect it to an event (for me i do not remember a lot of trauma due to dissociation).
