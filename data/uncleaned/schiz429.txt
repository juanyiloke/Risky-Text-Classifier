AlternativesWhat makes all of this worse is the fact that there are viable alternatives, that are completely dismissed and vehemently opposed by the mainstream mental “health” community and its parrots (those that don't really investigate, just repeat mantras). Talk therapies such as those revealed in the book 'Rethinking Madness' (ie. Existential Therapy, Trans-Personal Therapy) for those that their psychosis was caused by or includes some mystical or psycho\social context. Orthomolecular Therapy, which is a nutritional approach to resolving psychosis for those the cause was primarily created by nutritional (vitamin or mineral) imbalances. Some websites give paltry or pathetic attention to nutrition and shoot down Orthomolecular Therapy. There are other therapies available as well for different causes that have good results, such as Dialectic talk therapy and Open Dialogue talk\social therapy as it is practiced in the Lapland of Finland (which has a very, very high recovery rate with none to little use of drugs). In fact, the further I have researched the more the picture is becoming clear, the Medical Model is a failure, not only for the people who suffer, but for their care givers, and the professionals in the mental health profession. To know these real and rational approaches to resolving psychosis (and other disorders) and not talk about them in chat rooms or forums, is being silent about solutions that could create great change in peoples lives.
