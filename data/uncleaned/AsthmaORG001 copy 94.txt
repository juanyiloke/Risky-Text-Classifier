Tired of Dealing With Severe Asthma I have severe chronic asthma going on for nearly two years. I find myself increasing tired of dealing with asthma, doctors, treatments, record keeping, disability and all of the other bits that go along with asthma that simply refuses to bow to the current set of medicines and techniques for treating asthma. I'm finding my latest exacerbation especially hard to deal with emotionally. I had six weeks of relatively good control. It was the first time in ages. When I feel good it seems almost impossible that I could ever have felt so bad before. I was so hoping that I was seeing the end of this long period of out of control asthma. Then came September and my lungs went back to school along with the children. I'm about to start Xolair - if it makes a difference that will be wonderful. But if it doesn't , I feel I'll be in for the long haul.I am wondering how others with severe chronic asthma manage. Do you get tired of nursing yourself? Of endless rounds of inhaler puffs, nebulizer treatments, medication schedules, doctors who want to reinvent the diagnostic wheel, doctors who are sure every other got it wrong, the do I go in or not decision, repeat hospitalizations (hospitalized three times for hydrocortisone treatment in the last six months), the disappointment when the latest taper attempt ends in a splat, and so on?How do you keep your spirits and energy up?
