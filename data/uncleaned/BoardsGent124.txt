Receding Hairline See Mod warning in post #1As the title says Im looking for advice on products that will help slow down or even stop a receding hairline. I still have a very good head of hair. But in the last 2 years my hairline at the front has started to recede. It isnt very noticeable and if it continues at this rate I wont be going bald any time in the near future! I dont even have a bald patch on the top of my head.But before it does become a more serious issue I want to take action. I know of some hair loss products, Regaine, Rogaine (not sure if its the same as regaine) Nourkrin and lately I've started seeing a product called Alpecin at my local barbers. So do any of these actually work? Or is there other products I should consider?I'd really appreciate some advice on this but can we please keep any talk of shaving it off out of the discussion. I dont need to shave it off, Im just trying to talk some early action!Mod note - Any chat about any drugs that are not over the counter will incur mod actions.
