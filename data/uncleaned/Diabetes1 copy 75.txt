Eye TestSo 10 weeks after diagnosis I finally got a letter instructing me to book an eye test, up until now I have always had 20/20 vision - I think I have had some eye damage as I can no longer read small print despite now having good control of my bloods, and more than often a little blurry, again despite having good control.I guess I would just like some feedback, what to expect at the exam and just any other information / experience others can give or have.
