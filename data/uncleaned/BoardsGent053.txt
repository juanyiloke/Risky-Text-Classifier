Lack of eyebrowsSo, the eyebrows are disappearing. Currently half each side is there, and the other half is very much thinned out. Thus, wondering what options there are? It seems the cost of hair transplant is in the region of Û4000-Û5000 for the procedure, with another Û10 per hair transplanted.Although I currently wear glasses, in the long term I'll be getting laser eye surgery, so the lack of eyebrows would become very obvious when I stop having to wear glasses.
