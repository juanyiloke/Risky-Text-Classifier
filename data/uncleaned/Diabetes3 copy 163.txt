Eye ProblemAfter a couple of hours at work my eyes really sting and water, this has been happening for the past couple of weeks. The stinging continues in to the evening and is really quite bad. I had 2 days off at the end of last week and over the time I was off it didn't happen so must be linked to the VDU work. I sometimes wear glasses for VDU work (depending on my BGs) but have not been straining to see, just getting the awful stinging, although the glasses do help slightly. I rang the opticians to book myself an appointment and they said because I am diabetic it is a priority so have fitted me in tomorrow morning. I am not overly concerned, my recent retinopathy test was fine, just wonder what the reason could be?
