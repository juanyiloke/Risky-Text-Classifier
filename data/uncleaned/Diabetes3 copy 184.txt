where do i go from here ?7 months down the line and have been doing OK until the last three weeks or so. Started off with an HbA1c of 58 in July 2014, which is now down to 50 Weight was 12st and now down to 9st 7lb  Waking sugars were an average 6 - 6.5 but now 7.3 - 9  Pre meals sugars were anything from 5-5 - 6.5, but now between 7 - 9 Post meals were usually 9 - 10 (if carbs involved) or 6.5 - 7 if no carbs involved. But now anything between 8 and 10 whether carbs involved or not.My diet is mainly protein (meat, cheese, fish, eggs) and lots of vegetables (but no potatoes or other carbs). The only meal I regularly consume carbs is breakfast when I have a cereal that is very low in sugar with 4 strawberries and plain soya yoghurt. The only other fruit (apart from the 4 strawberries) I have is a few raspberries, blueberries or blackberries with a sugar free jelly as a desert. Snacks are low calorie savoury popcorn, a few nuts or 2 sugar free biscuits occasionally.I haven't had chocolate/sweets at all in the last seven months and can count the number of small pieces of cake (birthday parties etc) that I've consumed on the fingers of one hand !On top of that my cholesterol levels haven't changed at all - started of at 5.4 and still at 5.4 !My GP (and me) still want to rely on diet and exercise to control my diabetes but I'm now struggling; I can't see anything else that I can cut out of my diet - it's as low carb and as sugar free as I can make it without giving up food altogether. I must admit that having to give up ALL my favourite foods (pasta, rice, jacket potatoes, bread, chocolate) has been very hard but I'm proud that I've managed to stick with it so far - however if sticking with it is not having any effect any longer and I'm feeling 'deprived', I ask myself "why bother ?" So, where do I go from here ?
