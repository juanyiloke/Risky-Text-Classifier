Asthma  8  I started about 2 weeks ago with shortness of breath and tight chest. I'm also having anxiety problems. So tuesday this week I couldn't breath and had a anxiety attack, what i thought. i also don't have medical aid and went to see my mom's doctor who sended me for a lung x-ray wich was clean, so I was diagnosed with Asma. Don't know what type or for what I'm having asma. He prescribed Foxrair 50/250 wich i must use one puff in the morning and one at night asswell venteze wich I must use every 4 hours and also Monte-air 10mg pills I must drink in the morning. I'm on it now for about a day and still have a tight chest and have trouble with taking deep breaths but doctor told me it will take a few days to work. My lungs are very closed according to him. How long do you guys think it will take before i really feel relieve? Cause I get anxious because of difficulty of taking a deep breath.Thank you
