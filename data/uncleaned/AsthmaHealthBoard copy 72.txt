Proper diagnosis of asthma________________________________________I am in my mid-30s and was diagnosed with asthma about a year ago. The diagnosis was made by my internist based on difficulty breathing, especially on exertion (breathing out becomes a sort of short, dry wheeze), and readings from a peak flow meter around 200 consistently over several months. I've never had any breathing problems until a year ago, although I have had rhinitis for about 6 or 7 years. I would like to know how people here were diagnosed with asthma, especially if it was later in life. What types of doctors do you go to in order to get correctly diagnosed? Do you need a chest x-ray or any other tests to confirm the diagnosis, or is the peak flow meter enough?I am asking because although my inhalers do help my symptoms, they help only partially, and my breathing issues have been getting worse over the last year. I also have some other symptoms that don't seem to fit the diagnosis (almost daily low grade fever that is accompanied by tachycardia, and occasionally I'll wake up in the night with cold sweat and chest pain).Thanks.Edit: Also, I thought it was important to mention that I am not a smoker, nor have I ever smoked, and I am not around second hand smoke.
