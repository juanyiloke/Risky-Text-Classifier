Seasonal Affective Disorder/Winter Depression Hello, first of all forgive me english as much as you can, thanks!Anyways, I live now in a very warm country. We have like 4-5 month's of winter and than very warm/hot weather. in summer it gets up to 40C in winter down to 5C ( pretty rare ) . anyways as you get it i'm used to this kind of weather.Now my family decided to move to Norway for alot and alot of reasons. now the problem is alot of times when the weather is bad ( not sun, rain ) im feeling very sad, i cant even explain this. im feeling deprresed and dont want to do anything,i need the sun maybe.what i can tell about my self, once after winter there was a very warm weather. i've felt so happy and good in my self that this day was amazing just from nothing.the question is, what i can do in long long winter's if im deppresed? is there any cure?Thanks!
