prostatectomy after R/T Does anyone have any experience with having a prostatectomy as a salvage treatment AFTER brachytherapy?I had brachytherapy treatment 6 years ago for localised prostate cancer; it appeared to be successful but two years ago my PSA started to rise.  Recent tests have shown the presence of prostate cancer (Gleason hi 7) but still confined to the prostate and with no evidence of spreading elsewhere. My urologist is one the top-ten in the UK and has recommended a prostatectomy since there is a good possibility of being cured.However, my concerns relate to continence and recovery time, both of which are likely to be more problematical when a prostatectomy is performed as a salvage treatment.Any thoughts????
