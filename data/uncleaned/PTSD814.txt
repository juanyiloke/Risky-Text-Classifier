ÊI'm ScaredDon't know whether to try a sensible thread or just let it out....ÊMy sister is currently staying and she has done something to deliberately antagonise my brother. He's not found out yet, but when he does, I don't know what will happen.I'm scared - not just for myself - but particularly for my Mum. I am worried about my sister too, but the chances are she'll be back where she lives before he finds out.The fear is crippling me so much at the moment.I lie awake at night and hear my Mum screaming (inside of my head).ÊIt's a replay of what's happened. It's what I fear is happening and what I fear will happen again. Only what will it be this time? How bad will it be?Will he kill her?I am kept awake by images of what he could do to me, or my parents, or my dogs.He talks about my hair a lot... I fear he will shave my head because he got clippers out before as a "joke".I fear he'll hurt the dogs. My dog runs out the room when he walks in and growls whenever he goes near him.I fear my Dad will fly off the handle - not that I give a shit if my brother gets hurt - it's more what if my Dad ends up arrested or going to prison?Every time my phone rings or I hear a car outside I think it's the police coming to tell me he's killed my parents.FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I WANT TO DIE TO ESCAPE THIS SHIT.I don't really want to die, it's him that should die. Fuck off and leave us all alone. Get out of my head, you ****. Get out of my life, you fucking disgusting ****.MY bowels are torturing me at the moment. I'm (almost) literally shitting myself with fear. It feels like i'm being stabbed in the bowels. Under my ribcage is tender.P.S. - I don't feel I can say this to my care coordinator. It's too awkward between us and her mannerisms make me feel like I should just shut up.
