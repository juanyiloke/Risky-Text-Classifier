HobbiesHey allNew year, new start and all that.Basically my missus says I need a hobby. Literally all I do is work 50 hours and in my free time I drink beer, gamble and play Football Manager- not conducive to a healthy lifestyle or bank balance! I have zero other hobbies!What do fellow Gentleman do as a main hobby in their free time and do you guys have any recommendations?Cheers
