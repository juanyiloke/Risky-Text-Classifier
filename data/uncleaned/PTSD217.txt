My mother killed herself when I was 18.by patientlywaiting » Thu Mar 19, 2015 4:52 amI will make this short. My mom killed herself less than a month before my 19th birthday by jumping off a bridge. I had to deal with her severe mental illnesses and addictions for at least five years beforehand where she would constantly threaten suicide, attempt suicide, frequently overdose on various drugs and alcohol, constantly disappear for many hours or several days (leaving my brother, father and I wondering if she was alive or dead). Also, my father is in absolute failure as a "parent" and has never been there for me. I never had a remotely normal life. I am now 24 years old and I have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and I sometimes just think about ending my life as I have very little in my life to be thankful for, besides my health, a few good friends, and my brother and cousins, whom I am close to. I am very grateful for those people. But I am extremely poor, on my own, and find I just don't have any interest whatsoever in doing anything anymore as I simply am unable to do anything due to being extremely poor and depressed. I sometimes think I should just "clock out" of life like my mother decided to do. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else is dealing with the suicide of a loved one. I don't know anyone else who has been through what I have... i would just like the opportunity to talk to someone who understands.
