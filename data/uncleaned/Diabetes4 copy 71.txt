New resultsSo I go off to see the Endo today and get the best news! New Hb1Ac is 6.8% the lowest it has ever been for me and the last in a long line of dropping Hb1Acs over the last 8 months or so. He also agreed with me that trying metformin was worth a go to see if I could get down the amount of insulin I need for meals and maybe even drop some of the weight I've put on since taking better care of my diabetes. My heart rate and BP are both pretty high but he is convinced it is white coat causing that. I'd agree with him, I don't feel worried but my body thinks otherwise. The nurse doing my BP even said afterward she noticed I was trying to relax. He double checked my thyroid results because it can effect it he said? They were normal. I didn't get the breakdown of cholesterol but I will when my results update on my records. Total was 5.7 so about the same as always most likely. He was saying 'oh we'll not treat that until you are 40 or 50', and I was thinking 'you'll never treat it, I will via diet'.
