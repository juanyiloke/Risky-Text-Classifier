Women who just seem to hate and love to put down other womenOk, first off I'm a man but this is something I've noticed over my life,What is it with some women who just love to see other women fail in things or they just love putting them down, they don't want them to progress at jobs, think women are the cause of abuse they get, think they are incapable of driving big cars etc.I've seen this type of viewpoints in company's I've worked for where women will actively bully other women who are doing better then them, yet I've not seen the same sort of crap happen with men. Does it happen perhaps because when it comes to bullying men tend to be more physical bullying as opposed to women who tend to be more physiological bullying perhaps?Also I see and hear it alot in day to day life, "oh, what does she want with getting a big important job like that for" or "sure she doesn't need to be driving that car, she won't be able to handle it". Yet again you never hear these comments directed at men.Finally, we see it on boards.ie. Hell, you even see it in this forum most recently where some people are quick to blame women for abuse they receive or to defend others who have no problem with people who try to threat women differently when it comes to medical issues.What are your views on this? Why does it happen? My guess is its a society thing left over from the backwards views spread by the catholic church...basically women are second class and incapable, you've only to look at the awful backwards laws and viewpoints discussed in the "The Shaming and Control of Women" thread to see where alot of it comes from.In some respects women seem to be their own worst enemy's, its kind of odd at times
