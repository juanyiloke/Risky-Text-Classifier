Tattle tale at work2012-07-31, 05:49 PMTwo weeks ago, I had a minor disagreement with one female coworker. I never even raised my voice but I was upset because talking to her is very frustrating. She likes to repeatedly tell me about my mistakes. I already explained my reasons & I even asked her what can I do to correct them but she just kept talking about my mistakes. I got upset because the conversation was going nowhere. Then she says that I don't have to get mad at her. Anyway, later that day, I apologized and then I said I'll fix them this week. I thought we were past that. But today my director privately reprimanded me about what happened. She said someone told her about it but it wasn't that girl. I thought to myself that there were only two people in that room so clearly I wasn't the tattle-tale. But I did tell my director that I apologized that same day & corrected my mistakes that week.ÊSo I saw her in the office today and I had to stop myself from strangling her. She always acts so sweet & innocent but she's not. She likes pointing out other peoples mistakes over and over again.ÊI want to get back at her but I figured that it's not worth it. She's makes me so mad. I need to vent out.Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it's inspiring.
