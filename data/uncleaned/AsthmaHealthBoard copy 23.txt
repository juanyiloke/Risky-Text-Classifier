possible asthma diagnosis?!________________________________________I have had shortness of breath for the last couple of months and was so surprised when a pulmonary doc told me that I may have asthma - at the age of 53?! I have had cardiac issues ruled out (heart cath) and he gave me a sample of Symbicort to try while I wait for a spyrometer test. What I have realized is this:* When I am short of breath (even at rest), I breathe out faster than I breathe in. It can take me a couple of seconds or so to breathe in, but just a second to breathe out, and it seems to go out like a "huff". * I was surprised to find that the Symbicort seemed to even out that breathing pattern! My exhalation time is slower and not as "huffy". * Although the Symbicort doesn't completely relieve my shortness of breath it does help, as seen by having forgotten to take my first dose today.Any idea what this might mean? Just seems strange to me, as I have read that the inspiratory to expiratory ratio should go the opposite direction? Thanks!Rje
