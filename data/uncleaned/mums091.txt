Himy overexcited preschooler squeezed his 17 day old sister round the middle yesterday afternoon, she grimaced and tried to move away.ÊShe's slept and fed well and done wees and poos since, so the GP I phoned thinks there is no cause for concern although says I'm welcome to bring her in if I'm concerned and I have an appointment for tomorrow morning just in case.ÊI feel terribly guilty as I was actually holding her at the time. It started off as a sweet cuddle with him putting his arms around her but then he just squeezed! Needless to say he won't be getting his arms around her again.ÊHas anyone else been in this situation and everything been ok?ÊAlso any tips on how to cope with both of them at home gratefully received - my son does preschool 3 days a week but has 2 days at home with me and now I am dreading those 2 days! I don't know how I'm even going to get to the loo and get bottles washed let alone rest! I am thinking I'll take baby into the loo with me and sit her in her bouncy chair or even Moses basket if I have to, although monkey son can unlock the bathroom door from the outside! I used to feel like I didn't want to put him in preschool for any more days but am beginning to wonder if I should if there are any spaces...but don't want him to feel pushed out of the house! Any advice much appreciated!
