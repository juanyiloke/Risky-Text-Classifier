My blood sugar levels are regularly in high 20s/30's mmols. GP says I need insulinMy old GP missed hba1c result of 126 in Nov'13. Came to light at new patient interview with new GP when I said my symptoms were worse and were so like those of diabetes. Hba1c at that time (Aug'15) was 157. Commenced on metformin, blood sugars lowered a little at first but now constantly in high 20's and up to 33. Seen by GP yesterday, hba1c now 121. GP says that further tablets won't work and I need insulin BUT I have to see a consultant first. I'm scared. I'm very whoozy and have fainted once - blood sugar after was 33. I have chest pains, neuropathic pain in toes and fingers, extreme fatigue, nausea. Should I hold tight or panic and dial 999? I'm afraid that one morning I just won't wake up. At my GP appointment yesterday, I was told that the medical sec would phone me this morning to arrange the consultant appointment, which would be in under 2 weeks. A few moments ago, the receptionist informed me that this was not the case and she can't say when the med sec will call me, or when the appointment will be. Help!
