scared and confusedHello, I am so scared and confused about what to do,I feel lie i am not getting enough info from doctors. I am schedule for radiation treatment on this Monday. I am not sure of my stage or my type all I know is a typical carcinoma. I went to the hospital after a car accident had chest x-ray and they saw a mass on my lower right lobe.Er doctors did not know what to say it was, so I was told to go see a surgeon who then said that it was a cyst and a small nodule which I should have removed. Never had a biopsy or heard that it might be or could be cancer.had the surgery to remove lower right lobe only to find out that there was a tumor on my middle lobe so the middle lobe was also removed.Now after being in ICU for a couple of days I still do not know that i have cancer.Moved to a regular room and Dr comes in when family is gone and tells me.All alone and scared.So in saying all that should i start treatment with out knowing staging and sure of cancer type.Most people know this before starting treatment.SO CONFUSED don't know what to do.Please HELP.Schedule to have pet/ct scan a month after I start treatment is this correct, should I wait,never got any papers just discharge papers. Surgery day was 11/17/14.WHAT TO DO. PLEASE HELP.
