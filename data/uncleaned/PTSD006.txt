HellbladeHey, it looks like there is a video game in development that is trying to convey the effects of mental illness through the gameplay. A viking woman who watched her family die is trying to function despite suffering from severe psychosis and PTSD. From reading the development interviews it looks like the creators were trying to avoid sensationalism and consulting with a lot of psychiatric professionals. I guess I should put a bit of a trigger warning here because the video trailer sorta made me cry.. But it looks really interesting. I was always thinking that eventually games would try to tackle serious issues as the industry matured. Looks like somebody is giving it a shot.
