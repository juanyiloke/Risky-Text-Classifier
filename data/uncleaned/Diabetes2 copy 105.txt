might have to take tablets   a second GP has told me that I might have to take tablets for my type 2 diabetes,this is really scaring me as I took injections for gestational diabetes and had real problems with highs and lows so Im worried this will happen with tablets.Also my mum in law made the comment \&quot;you dont want to start taking drugs for diabetes,its all down hill from there \&quot; ! made me really scared after saying that to me.  Anyone also experienced when there diabetes is not controlled you get flu symptons and feel faint ???
