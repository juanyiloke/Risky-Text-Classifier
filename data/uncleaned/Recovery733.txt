 That moment u wake up from deep sleep...And don't remember anything from the day before. I like that feeling of starting again. What happens after that moment, can coloured my whole day. I'm going to run with it! I can start afresh. And hope for right now, to improve from whatever was before. The ups & downs of my bipolar 2 are quite mysterious. I'm a different person than I was last week. I'm seeing things clearer. Let's hope it sticks around a bit longer this time. If those challenges do come my way again, I need to be more prepared & be easier on myself.
