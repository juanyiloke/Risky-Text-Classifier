I meetup with people who had depression and SA,they are like my friends now.During the meetup I open up that I had schizophrenia and they had SA and Depression.I always knew my problem isn't psychosis but emotional and social problem,I hope they are cool about my problem,we had a good time that day,everything should be coolAll of them doesn't take medication and probably doesn't need.There is a cute girl has taken two years of meds and had already stop.I think their condition is good enough to not need meds and they are not SZ too
