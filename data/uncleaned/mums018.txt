I have wanted a third child since before I even had my second, and always had planned on having another... but due to being very overweight, and money being terrible, we had basically decided it wasn't on the cards. I wasn't happy about it, but I wasn't devastated either... that was until very many people in my life got pregnant. This includes my two sister-in-law', and my brother announced this weekend the baby was here. I was incredibly happy for them, but out of sight, I was utterly distraught... I spent some time crying, and pulled myself together, but I have been incredibly depressed since, feeling unable to get myself together, do normal tasks etc... it has really really got to me. Do I just wait for it to pass? I visited yesterday, and met my beautiful niece, and I was blissfully happy, and the broodiness didn't get to me... I happily cleaned their place and kept baby busy while they got some much needed rest. Got home and felt a bit sad again, and then got up today and I keep looking at the pictures of her and feeling that tremendous sadness again...I just can't seem to conquer it... and I feel so unreasonable and ungrateful. I have a lovely partner, and two beautiful girls... and it just doesn't feel enough
