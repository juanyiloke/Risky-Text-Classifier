BulimiaI am 16 years old and have been diagnoised with bulimia. I find its really hard to tell people you have this condition as they immediatley think you are some kind of freak and are completly different from everyone else. I began making myself sick when i found out my granddad had a terminal illness and found it to be helpful in relieving my stress. When i look back now i think how stupid i was but when you start you find it so hard to stop yourself. As a student studying for my GCSE's i think it would be soo much easier for people like myself to tell others if conditions like these were taught more in school and made more aware of. Problems like these are more common that you would think. I have not made my self sick for over a year now but find it really hard when i become stressed or ill. Now i have turned to exercise as a way of getting rid of stress which isnt the best idea but is better than the vominting. I would say to anyone my age if you believe you have some kind of illness like Bulimia or Anorexia dont keep it to yourself as thats the worst thing you can do. Just tell someone you are worried about this and get help as soon as possible as it only becomes worse and tries to take over your life. But dont let it!
