Does true friendship exist? I would say am someone whom everyone considers to have everything under control and I am cool, calm and collected. The problem is I have never had a friend that lasted really long enough for my liking. Most of the time its by my doing and others I dont just trust people enough to keep them around me for too long.ÊI try so hard to be a friend but I end up finding out 'in my head maybe', that they are just interested in what I have or might have to offer. This inevitably makes me forget them somehow.My question to anyone reading is "does true friends exist or is it that i'm looking in it for just too much''.N.B; I'm a realist.
