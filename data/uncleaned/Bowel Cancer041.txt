6 month post-op CT scan is fine.Good afternoon all,I'm pleased to say that I've just had my 6 month post-op (rectal cancer) CT scan results and all is fine.It's been a nervy couple of weeks or so, waiting for the results, and not wanting to make plans for the immediate future.(I do have the added worry that my Mum died from pancreatic cancer in June and Grandad also, in the sixties.) It makes me wonder if life will ever settle down again or if this is what it's like from now on.I'm sure lots of you have been there and know where I'm coming from and I do know I am very lucky compared to some.Also, poor Linda Bellingham dying keeps potential problems in high focus.Anyway, not to linger in the gloom, I do feel truly thankful that all is well so far and long may it continue!Hannah
