How was your day today?Today is the first day I feel like I finally am awake and alive again. I got my diagnosis a little over a week ago and I have felt like i've been walking around in a haze; going through the motions and nothing is really sinking in. I am not sure what has changed but I;ve been feeling really good. My mom heads back to wyoming for a while to get back to work ( I will miss her for sure but I know she will be back) and taking care of my dad. Maybe that is the first step to getting on with things; I won't have her taking care of the day to day anymore. The sun was shining today and it was FABULOUS! We got a high of 58F and we met up with our realtor to look at some houses. We decided on one and are making the offer tomorrow with fingers crossed.This is the first big step we are making and carrying on with things. I dont feel so terrified and helpless today and i couldn't help but think as we got back to our apartment that today is just a really good day. I was talking with some College girl friends about the house and about how scary it feels to have to be a grown up (ok so we are all about 26; guess we gotta be a little grown up) but i came to the realization that nothing will hold me back and life really can be short so I am not in the mantra of live to the fullest.On a side note I really enjoyed the thread about the anti-cancer diet and plan to look more into it. Im not sure how thrilled the boyfriend will be about less meat and more veggies but i can't wait. Ive never been a big meat eater myself but with the house I plan on having a veggie garden to enjoy. There is nothing better than a fresh picked grilled tomato sammy.This is a bit of a random post today but I wanted to share my happiness with everyone and wish you all a wonderful day with lots of love and hugs to all.
