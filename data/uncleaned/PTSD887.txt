 What types of things will a psychiatrist ask/do?I feel so incredibly nervous about seeing one. My appointment is on Monday afternoon and I have this total fear which I think is probably thanks to the media! I already see a psychologist- I've opened up a lot to him. Presumably the psychiatrist will have all that info? So I'm going to see this guy and I'm wondering what types of things he'll say, what he'll do and basically what will happen in general? I saw one as a kid but I can't remember very much at all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated
