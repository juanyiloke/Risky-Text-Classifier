7 weeks low-carbing and BG still in double figuresIt sometimes goes down to between 7 and 9.0 but most of the time it's between 9 and 16, occasionally higher.I've been very strict with my diet, around 30g Carbs a day, although I'd say under 50g to allow for any hidden carbs I've not counted, but no more than that. Except the other day I tried 2 tiny slices of seedy wholemeal bread and went from around 9 to 19 within the hour.I spoke to my DN today and we've decided that when I have my HBA1C next Monday they'll also do the test for LADA. I also have several severe autoimmune illnesses so it's as well to test for that too.I know other inflammatory illnesses and viruses are also affecting my BG, but my levels are swinging wildly from high to low and back again, which is just ridiculous considering what I'm eating. (I actually got a 5.7 once but apart from that I've not gone below 7)Has anyone else had the same problems, and did you ever get an answer as to why your levels were so very unstable?Although I desperately don't want to go on insulin I'm half hoping the test comes back showing LADA, at least there'll be a reason for the problems and something can be done to sort it.
