ÊDoes my sister have an eating disorder?I don't have an eating disorder but I'm posting here because lately I've been worried that maybe my younger sister does. She doesn't look anorexic necessarily, she's about 5'4 and underweight I'd guess. Whenever I go to her house for dinner everything she makes for dinner is super healthy and significantly smaller portions than what I eat. Today when I talked to her she was crying because she took her little guy to the doctor and the doctor was so concerned about the fact he's not putting on weight that he's referring them to a dietitian. My sister is furious about the fact that she's being forced to see a dietitian. I know she's not intentionally starving her kids as they do eat but since my sister feeds her kids the same meals she eats they probably aren't getting enough calories. Another thing I found to be strange was the other day she posted a picture of a pan of brownies on her social profile and said she ate that for a snack but then I thought that was strange since I had been at her house the night before when she made the brownies and I was the one who ate most of those brownies, not her. My boyfriend also mentioned that when we went to a restaurant with her and her husband a few months ago she mostly just moved food around on her plate but didn't really eat it. I don't think she has anorexia or bulimia or if she is just so obsessed with healthy eating that it's become a type of eating disorder? How can I be supportive? I talked to her about it and said to just be cooperative and do what the dietitian tells her to do but she seems to be in denial and convinced that a diet of mainly vegetables is a healthy diet.
