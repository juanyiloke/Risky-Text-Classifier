I am home again....From a fabulous week in Tavira right at the eastern end of the Algarve in Portugal.  Lovely, picturesque old town with lots of nooks and crannies to explore, not to mention fantastic restaurants serving really fresh fish (and one of the best steaks I've eaten in years).  The river runs down the centre of the town and you get a ferry to the beach which is 11 miles long on an island about 20 minutes away through salt pans which have flamingoes roaming loose.  Some friends kindly let us use their town house, situated right in the middle of the restaurant area with a fab roof terrace.I was quite good with food to start with but had quite a few hypos due to a combination of hot weather, lots of walking (up and down hills) and rubbishy carb counting!Then we came back to UK on 18th, stayed at Gatwick overnight and on Friday after meeting friends from Surrey for lunch we went onto Aldermaston in Berkshire where we attended the wedding of our god-daughter on Sat 20th.  Returned home on Sunday.  Over that period I could barely get my BGs out of the teens!  Why?  Not at all sure.  Changed my whole set a couple of days early in case, but that didn't seem to help.  It was today before I got it sorted and back to normal.Since my return home I've not been online all that much because my Anti-virus subscription ran out yesterday and we weren't paying £55 for something which had proved to be very invasive and slowed my machine down to the point it was often unusable.  Have just installed Kaspersky (a lot cheaper and well recommended) and hope that will be less intrusive.So now I am going to work my way through all those threads I marked "unread" whilst I was away!
