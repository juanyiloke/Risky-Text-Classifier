Receding hairline at 17?Well to be fair it's been happening for nearly two years..I've never had the best hairline.. I was actually called ET for a long time as a young teen but that's died down now.It's receding at the temples mainly in round circle cut out shapes..ÊThere are little straggly hairs around the hairline and I've noticed some thinning at the crown and temples..So needless to say it's all can tits up..I would just shave it off but there's a few problems.1-I've a queerly shaped head, it's larger at the top and comes down to a narrower chin (could be the hairline playing tricks on me)And I've a 2 inch scar on the back along with some dips and lumps..2-my face doesn't seem to fit my head.. (Self explanatory it all seems squished in)Ê3-I've don't have a beard (yet)I'm not one to fuss over appearance but this is starting to tick me off..ÊAny ideas?ÊCheers
