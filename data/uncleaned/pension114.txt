today's studentsI was chatting to my cousin the other day.Ê She works in a college and part of her job is to arrange placements so that the students can have work experience.She tells the students that, if they are unable to go to the placement, they must phone up.Ê A typical response is 'my mother says what right has Miss M.. got to say you have to make a phone call'.Ê With such an attitude how on earth can they expect anyone to employ them?
