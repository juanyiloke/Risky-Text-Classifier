Schizophrenia? Anxiety, paranoia.. You name it.I've struggled with my mental health since I was around fourteen. Lately however, things have gone from bad to worse. I have these.. realities I guess you could call them. I used to just think I was a daydreamer - that what everyone called it anyway. These 'daydreams' each have a story and families and careers. Each of them is going through life and have their day to day problems just like I do. I knew which one was my reality and which one was theirs however over the last year or two I've been confusing them more and more. Sometimes to the point where I won't recognise myself in the mirror because I'm convinced I'm somebody else. When I realise my mistake I get incredibly angry and frustrated and confused. I should also mention that mood swings, paranoia, distrust of others, and anxiety are all major issues for me also. I can't make a hair appointment or board a bus alone without panicking or thinking people are watching, talking or plotting something against me. I don't have many friends because I don't like people to know anything about me. The ones I do have are merely 'text friends'. I make up any excuse not to socialise with them. I used to think people could hear my thoughts, I don't worry about that too much anymore but there's always that 'what if'.. I've never been to a Doctor for anything regarding my mental health. I know that I need to but this is where my anxiety kicks in. I am miserable. I can't even find work because of these issues! I got an interview not too long ago but had a breakdown on the bus, got off two stops later and went home. Does anybody know what this is and how I can get this out to my Doctor without having an anxiety attack? Any input would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.
