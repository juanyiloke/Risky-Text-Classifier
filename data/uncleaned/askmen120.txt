Confused with this hiring process. Help?2012-04-16, 07:54 AMI applied for a county job nearly 6 months ago and im down to the last step of the the hiring process. The HR department informed me that i need to tell my current employer that i applied for a position with the county and they will call my employer to verify that i made that commitment. Only after they verify i have done that will they FORMALLY open the position to me. The county advised me that i should not tell my boss its a 2 weeks notice but only advise him that i applied for another job.Problem is that this leaves me in a awkward position, and im not sure exactly how to go and tell my boss properly and politely enough to smooth everything out.Any suggestions or help will be greatly appreciated.
