Skydive for DiabetesIt’s official, I hate having Type 1 Diabetes so much that I’ve decided to throw myself out of an aeroplane to do something about it. No, not to end it all, but to raise money for charity. On Saturday, 25th April 2015, I will be doing a tandem skydive from 10,000 feet alongside my colleague Claire Levy and our volunteer supporters Lynwood Newman, Chris Edwards and Sarah Brown. The jump will take place at Old Sarum in Salisbury with GoSkydive. Together we are hoping to raise over £4000 for DRWF. Every penny we raise will go straight to the charity and help us continue our work providing educational support, events and resources for people living with diabetes and the healthcare professionals that look after them, whilst also funding vital diabetes research to establish the causes; develop improved management and treatment options; and ultimately find a cure. We have set up a JustGiving page for those wishing to support us. Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving – they’ll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they’ll send your donation directly to DRWF. So it’s the most efficient way to donate – saving time and cutting costs for the charity.
