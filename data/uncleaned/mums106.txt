The first thing i noticed after my daughter was born was her hairy forehead. It was very distressing but i became even more distressed when i saw her hairy back, shoulders, arms, thighs and ears. My mum says i shouldn't worry as the hair will disappear soon. However, i keep thinking about it all the time.The midwives who visit us always comment on it expecting me to make a joke but i just ignore those comments. i just imagine my poor baby carrying all this fur throughout her life. One pediatrician said it's because of my hormones so i blame myself now. I also thought could it be because of pregnacare multivitamin which contains biotin - a supplement which improves hair and nails. I'd appreciate it if you shared your experience with me. Does that hair really disappear and when?
