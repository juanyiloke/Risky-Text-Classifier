Just started a new on-line courseSo, I register for this on-line course about dementia but I'm already stuck on the first questionaire. It's all so technical. I'm spending far too much time trawling for information so that I can answer in a simple way but so far I'm not getting very far. Why do I do this to myself? It's not as if I need to put myself through it.Can anyone here explain in idiot talk how the nervous system works and how to describe how information enters and exits a neuron?
