Suicide. I am unemployed. I am going to be foreclosed on. Hell I try and be nice to others and am treated with the up most contempt. It is if I was wearing a kick me sign. I have absolutely no friends or future. Why does god hate me. I've got a case of cerebral palsy. No relationships to speak of. A lady I liked quit contacting me. I am tired of being used by others. I still cant get a job I have nothing to live for. I am trapped. There is absolutely no reason for me to live. I always ruin anything good by making mistakes. I wish I was dead. I have to end my life because life is not work living.
