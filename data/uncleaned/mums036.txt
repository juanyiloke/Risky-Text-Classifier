Both of my children (girl age 5 and boy age 2) have started hitting/kicking/hair pulling. Mostly each other, and me/DP. We have a zero tolerance policy to it and will always put them on the step, or dd into her room. This has been going on for a few months .It is like they don't give a damn about being disciplined for it. Or rather, they get upset but then a short while later will do it again.I can't stand violence and we have never, ever smacked or anything. I'm ashamed to say though that, esp with dd who is old enough to know better, I have sometimes (like today) lost my mind at her- and cried, actually. I know this is probably Doing It All Wrong- but I'm at a total loss, it is so frustrating. It's awful, actually. We praise kindness and good behaviour, we sanction the hitting and hurting. But it carries on.Needless to say they can be absolutely lovely, sweet and kind. Dd (5) KNOWS it is wrong and sometimes feels very upset with herself. Ds (2) knows he shouldn't but is obviously less able to control himself. But yesterday he was hitting strangers at an event and I was mortified.Am so upset- and clearly struggling to manage my own emotional response....
