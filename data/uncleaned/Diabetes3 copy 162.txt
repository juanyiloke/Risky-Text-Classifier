+++ ketonesMy glucose levels have been crazy high lately and I don't know why   I'm having to take twice as much insulting.Just checked my levels and they were 19.0 so I tested for ketones and they are at +++/0.8 the one colour before the darkest one!   I've just taken some insulin and I'm drinking lots. My main symptom was just tiredness and I have been irritable and sensitive to noise.Shall I just keep drinking and checking?
