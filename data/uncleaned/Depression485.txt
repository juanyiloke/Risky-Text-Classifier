Life Of NothingÊ  IVAX ,Ê18 Apr 2015I haven't posted anything in a long time and I just feel I need to say some things. ÊI'm forty three now and still not any better. ÊI have this thing that a doctor diagnosed as depression. ÊI can't even remember how old I was. ÊTo this day I don't understand what it is. ÊI've never been married. ÊAlmost have always been single. ÊDon't own a home. ÊI don't want to come off as I am feeling sorry for myself. ÊMaybe I am a little but I just want to get these thoughts out of my head. ÊI quit drinking about a month ago. ÊI was drinking more than I ever had before. ÊSomehow I managed to stop. ÊCan't say I won't go back to it because it was the only thing that made me feel ok. ÊI work monday through friday and do nothing on the weekends. ÊA job I can barely handle being at for many reasons.I live in a rented room. Ê ÊSorry I am trying to figure out my point in all of this. ÊI feel like whatever I have(if I truly have something) it is like a terminal illness. ÊI feel no joy or happiness. ÊMostly anger and frustration. ÊI know I haven't done everything possible to try to help my illness but I have tried.I am just not sure what the world does with people like me. ÊI have to hide how I really feel to the outside world. ÊAll the time. ÊBecause lets face it society has given zero interest or acceptance of our illness. ÊI don't expect other people to understand. ÊI am just way past tired of feeling this way. ÊAs I am sure all of you are. ÊIf you read this thank you. ÊI try to be the good person I as raised to be but as I get older I just feel worse about myself. Ê So I guess I don't have a point. ÊI guess that is like my life pointless...
