The guy who sits next to me at work wont shut the hell up/is driving me crazy2014-01-24, 06:40 PMSo I love my job.Problem is at work I sit next to this guy, a 53yr old divorcee with extravagant ideas (one day he talks about how he is going to become a life coach, the next how he started a transgender group on meetup) who doesn't shut up. He talks on and on and on about random crap. He also talks badly about the organisation I work for which angers me because I respect my company a fair amount. I wouldn't mind listening to him if it was interesting or useful, but it's not.I don't engage with him anymore. I focus on my work and pretend I'm not even listening when he talks. I don't even reply.ÊA few times I have even told him to please stop talking so much as I find it hard to concentrate. He stops, and then re-starts the next day. Either he has no social cues, or just doesn't care.Everyone in the office avoids him like the plague.I'm at my wits end and thinking of bringing it up with my supervisor but I am unsure if this will look UN-professional of me, or look like I am bitching about one of my work colleagues?I'm also worried as he has been problematic in the workplace in the past. I'm worried that if I am rude or abrasive to him, he will take it up with HR or turn it into something nasty. He has escalated issues with colleagues in the past and it has gotten nasty.I am a very focused worker who doesn't do well with distraction. I like to focus on my work and get the job done, and done exceptionally well. Especially as I am passionate about my job.Has anyone been in this situation and what do you advise?
