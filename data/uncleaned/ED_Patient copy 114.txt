I am obsessed with foodWell where do i start, i have always been un happy about my weight, and i was always teased as a child and called fat. I still get told now that i am a little chubby! i am only a size 10 but i must admit i do see myself a lot bigger, i used to make myself sick after certain foods, but recently i have been making myself sick after everything i eat.I am a mother of 2 and think since having my children i have become worse. I am only 21 and things are starting to become worse as i now have to read everything on the back of packets and i am constantly thinking about food.I don't want any sympathy as i know what i am doing is very wrong and selfish but after i am sick i feel alot better and i still get the satisfaction of tasting good food.I always think that i will be able to stop myself but things are definately getting worse. I talk to close friends about this as they are very understanding which does help a lot. I am not ashamed of what i do and do not hide it, as i think it helps me that my friends close to me understand how i feel, obviously they don't approve.Thank you for letting me talk about my own experiences.
