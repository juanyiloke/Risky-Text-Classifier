Work colleague..depressed?________________________________________I know this is in the wrong forum but I'm not sure which one to put it in. Only reason it's here is because it's to do with a work colleague.I've been a little worried about her for a good while now, and today kind of validated something for me. She has gotten herself into a little spot and I don't think she knows how to get out of it. She goes out a lot. She drinks a lot. She could go socialising maybe 4 nights a week, and goes particularly mad at the weekends. I had a feeling for a while that she was compensating for something. I think she is drinking to fill some sort of void in her life.She told me yesterday that she is feeling sad, and that she feels sad a lot. I think she drinks to cover this up. Everyone sees her at this fun loving party girl. Don't get me wrong, everyone really likes her and she is genuinely one of the soundest girls out there, but she hides behind this a lot. Yesterday she opened up. She felt unwell, and put it down to the alcohol, and was saying she needs to give it up for a while because she is sad now. She told me how her closest friends all have fellas now and she has no one. SO i think she compensates by drinking.I'm seriously concerned for her. I told her she needs a break from work, she needs to get away just by herself, and get her head in a good place.Myself and a male colleague are her closest friends in work. I was chatting with him and he said he can see the same signs in her as he can in his father. His father is an alcoholic, and both of us think that she is heading that way.I don't know what way to approach it. She knows she can talk to me more than anyone else there in work. And we have good chats and conversations together. I don't like seeing her suffer, but I don't want to make a "big deal", or make her feel she has a problem. But I know she has. I think she is depressed.Sorry for the really long message.Any advice for her?
