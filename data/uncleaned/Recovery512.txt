  Making a List and Ticking things off One by One...!I have got about 2 months free until I goback  to college and I decided the other day to write a list of things I need to / want to do over this time, and tick them off when I've completed them. I was planning  on doing something on my list every day , although that's not working out quite well. But it doesn't put me off, and the list actually keeps me going. I mean, I do have moments when I think, I can't be bothered, I just want to give up and do nothing. But I promised myself that I would do something over theholidays , and this is it! I've already managed to tick a few things off since I wrote the list  which is a good start!   I have also told my sister about the list, and shown it to her, so when I next see her she'll ask me about it and I'll have had to do at least one more thing on there - or worked towards one more thing - to tell her about! Hopefully if I manage to tick off even just half of the things on the list, I think I'll have figured out how to not put things off entirely (nor forgotten about those things   ) and improved my life  in one way or another. Fingers crossed!
