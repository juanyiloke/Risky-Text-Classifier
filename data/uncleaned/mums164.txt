I have a lovely and lively 3 year-old DD and now have a 3-week old DD2.I was very tired and not able to do much in the last month or so but luckily DH was at home and was able to spend lots of time with DD1 and also since the birth.Basically I now feel less close to DD1 and she seems to be turning to her dad for a lot of things.I am probably complaining about nothing and maybe just "jealous" that DD1 is less dependent on me. :-D and also probably feeling guilty I have to pay so much attention to the new baby.ÊAnyone else had these feelings? Did things go back to "normal" after a while?
