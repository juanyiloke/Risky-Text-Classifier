ÊI wish i was deadI have been suffering from depression, paranoia and several anxiety disorders for a long time now. I also have myalgic encephalomyitus for about 19 years. All of which have destroyed my health. Doctors and hospitals have failed to help me out. I not only feel like death, but also look like death.Furthermore, I am poor, unable to have a job, unable to engage in sport. My family doesn't really care if I'm dead or alive, friends all have turned their backs. So I have nothing to live for and I have no support whatsoever.Every morning I wake up. But I don't want to, I want to pass away in my sleep.ÊI wish I was dead.To take my mind off things, I watch reality shows and movies. I see healthy and wealthly people explore and enjoy life. I start fantasizing of what my life could actually be like. Pretty pathetic, isn't it? But it is my only escape. Until the glorious day I will be finally released from this life of agony. I hope it won't be long now.
