Is there a limit to the amount of travel?________________________________________I started a new job three months ago and to say that it has been a disappointment is putting things mildly. On interviewing they promised me the sun, moon and stars and I accepted the job, turning down another job, on the back of these promises. They spent ages going on about how much they value work-life balance. I am unhappy with a variety of aspects of the job but I have a major problem with the travel. The job advert I responded to did not state that I would be required to travel. At no stage during the interview process did they mention that I would be required to travel. My contract states that I may be required to travel occasionally. I left my last job because of the frequency of travel. I have very young children and I want to spend time at home with them. Anyway, I have had to travel, staying overnight most times, on a weekly basis. I have also had to pay for my own hotel and car rental, on a few occasions, even though the company is supposed to pay the bill when they book the hotel room. So, do I have any grounds for complaint regarding the frequency of travel or should I just suck it up, see out the remainder of my six months probation and move to another company? I have spoken to HR regarding the issue of paying for my own hotel and car but they just said that these things happen and I can claim the money back through pay roll, if I have the receipt. This process takes six weeks. My manager agrees that the frequency of travel is excessive but doesn't feel that it is within her remit to do anything about it; her standard response to any issue I raise.
