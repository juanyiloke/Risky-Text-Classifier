Hello, New to this forum, so many interesting posts to read. I have a question for everyone regarding their experience with air trapping in the lower airways. I had a full pulmonary function test completed which showed all levels were hitting at a great level with no concerns. The test showed I have hyperinflation in my lower airways. Right away I feared copd as that is what comes to mind. The specialist stated it is definitely not copd but only uncontrolled asthma not being adequately controlled on current medications. Does anyone else have experience with this. It seems that whenever hyperinflation comes up it is always linked to copd and it worries me. Thank you. Hello, Lately I have been researching different living climates and wondering if some areas of the US are better for asthmatics than others. For me I have a hard time during the humid summer heat and very cold winters. Humidity makes me feel like I just am not getting any air and I end up staying in air conditioning which feels terrific in comparison. But in the cold winter months it's difficult running out in the cold so much and I have problems with that. Does anyone have any experience with different climates and how do you feel? I always thought out west might be a good choice but I have read it can be bad due to dust and pollution. Is there really a "good" climate? Thank you!
