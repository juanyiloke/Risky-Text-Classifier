do i really have ptsd? *may trigger*by IAmHolli » Sun Mar 15, 2015 7:30 pmNote: i am 16Some time ago, i was looking at my medication list and saw i had pill prescribed for ptsd. I had no idea what for. I had no flashbacks, no traumatic event that i could think of.i had recently been sexually assaulted by my younger brother recently, so figure that was it. My boyfriend insisted i had no symptoms, so i asked my mother. She didn't ever answer, until one day in therapy. Apparently, i had been raped by my grandfather when i was seven. I had no memory of this. It seems as though this is why i have mdd (not sure if anyone knows about this here). With mdd, i had a recurring theme in every dream i had. It all involved me being on the same level as an animal in some way. The day i got home from what happened, i had begun to pretend to be a puppy or cat. I won't go oo into detail here, wrong post =]I have no real symptoms that i know of. Sure, i have been afraid of men for most of my life. My boyfriend dated me for six months before i kissed him. Two months later, and i kissed him for more than "a peck". At 11 months, we can finally cuddle. But, my parents are divorced, and the only man i grew up with was my brother who molested me and raped my mother. Do i really have ptsd?
