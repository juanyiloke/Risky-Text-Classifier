Worried about chemo side effectsAfter having been diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer last week, I was told that my chemotherapy will start on Thursday 8th August. Am scared of the damage it will do to my heart, my kidneys....I don't care so much for the hair loss, I got myself an amazing wig....but am not sure what to expect. Doctors want me to take steroids a couple of days before it starts, even reading about those side effects scares the life out of me. To anybody who is currently undergoing chemo or have done in the past, what's it like? How does/did it affect you?Jenny x
