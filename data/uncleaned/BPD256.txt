 The situation I'm in is killing meHi all well where to start I was diagnosed with cyclothymia 4 years ago after 4 years of been messed about by different psychiatrist now I finally have one that is higher up in my hospital. This new Psychiatrist is better up to yet but has also now diagnosed me with BPD going be having DBT for this and I have got to go see a specialist for aspergers symptoms. That out way here my situation, been with my girlfriend/whatever we are now for over 2 years now at the time I met her I was in pretty place using wrong stuff to cope with my problems she is the reason I got clean I fell in love with her after a few weeks of meeting her, I can't explain how extreme/intense my love is for her well about 6 months in we start arguing over what I think is nothing, we would be on and off all the time till we get to the last 6 month she been very depressed and I know the cause of it all is her insecurity's, she is on tablets for depression but I'm 90% she has BPD too she finishing me all the time just so I will fight for her "she needs too feel wanted and loved" has she puts it but I'm giving her all my love and it feels like its not enough we always argue over the same stuff we have been for the last year or so.So after her many finishing me then phoning me days later breaking down on the phone begging me to not leave her, we carry on cycle happens again. But this final time she said I need to go because she is no good for me she can't be with anyone, she deleted all contact with me to stop her messing me about which to be honest has been hell but I love her, I've got put my all my stuff up from hers tomorrow she arranged not to be in so she doesn't start again. I tried not texting her all week but ended up doing yesterday so she is ignoring me. I have a chance to walk away but I love her so much I don't want to but my emotions are all the place one moment I think stuff it just going get my stuff and get but then I know how much I love her I can't do it I'm stuck in the middle I can't walk away and if I give living how we are I will end up dead. any advice  glad to get it all out but running out of time now to get my stuff
