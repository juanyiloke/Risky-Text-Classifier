scared, frustrated *triggering*?I don't know if this belongs here or in another form (it fits under many).ÊI finally found a therapist after a mess of no's mainly due to insurance reasons and location reasons. My therapist mentioned to me today that if I don't improve shes giving me a referral to a psychiatrist. Ignoring how I feel about psychiatrists (never ever had a good experience). I don't appreciate people telling me im stupid thanks much.I'm worried that shes just going to refer me to the stupid psychiatrist and stop working with me all together. I put in way too much effort just trying to convince myself to trust her and im starting to think it may have been a horrible mistake. Plus I don't hate her like every other therapist ive run across. And the area im in is extremely conservative which makes finding someone coming at this without a religious standpoint really hard. The last thing I need is gay therapy.My eating has been 90 percent better lately than in the past like few months. I'm scared the rugs going to be pulled out from under me yet again and everything's going to be for nothing. Plus shes gone for 10 days so I get time to mull over this ugh.
