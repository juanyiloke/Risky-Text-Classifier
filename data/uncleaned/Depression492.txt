What Do You Need To Overcome Depression?Ê  Eric_Lagun ,Ê23 Apr 2015Hello All,I come to this forum because over the past few months I've been writing an ebook on how to overcome depression.I was severely depressed from the age of 13-16 and dragged myself out of it. Through a long road of ordeals, contemplating suicide, lessons learned, and dead-ends searching for answers, I finally found the key that turned the lock to recovery. While I filled the book with knowledge that helped me overcome depression, I wanted to make sure I addressed other's needs as well, as we are all different.ÊI know back when I was depressed I was very cynical towards "self-help" books, and when I did pick a few up they didn't help me at all. I was however hoping to provide concrete resources and stories from my experience that actually worked in real life- no meditation techniques or visualization or anything like that.To anyone going through depression here I would like to ask:- What answers are you looking for?- What challenges are you having trouble overcoming?- What do you want your life to look like (once you overcome depression)?- Do you think an ebook on how to overcome depression (written by someone who has been through it) would be useful, or do you feel the key to overcoming your depression lies somewhere else? If so, where?Hoping to be of help,Eric Lagun
