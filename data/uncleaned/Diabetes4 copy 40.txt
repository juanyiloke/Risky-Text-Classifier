What The Doctors Don't Tell YouI'm being interviewed by WTDDTY some time in the next few days. They are interested in how I've improved my health condition by doing something considered to be alternative to drugs, surgery or medical advise.They initially approached me via eMail and I've already given them an overview of how certain drugs really made my health deteriorate and that reducing my carb intake has allowed me to lose weight and dispose of three different prescription drugs and they seem to be interested in 'my story'. I've read several issues of this publication and generally speaking have enjoyed their opinion that there is more we can do than just take the tablets, hopefully I get some say in what they print.Perhaps there might be some other members of this forum who have some advise, I'm all ears.
