Hi! I just found this website and joined. I'm going through and joining support groups and I thought this one would be a great place to start. I'm 35 years old and I've been diagnosed with asthma since I was 16. I've been on a good balance of meds for about the last 10 years. I currently take 10mg of Singulair once a day, and Advair 50/500 2'xs a day. However, I was in a car accident about five weeks ago, broke five ribs on the left side and one rib on the right. I punctured my left lung and I've been having breathing problems ever since. I've met with the trauma team who took care of me immediately after the accident, my GP, and my pulminologist, so I'm under great care. I'm just getting used to being at square one when it comes to limitations with breathing again. For the first three weeks after being home from the hospital, I was doing breathing treatments pretty consistently. The Saturday after I first came home from the hospital I totally overdid it and wound up at the ER. I got a short dose (four days) of prednisone to help open up my airways. I can't be on prednisone for long because of all of the other injuries I sustained (but didn't list here). I just hate being back to the beginning. So for all of those new to Asthma, I feel your pain. And all of those long time sufferers, I feel your pain too! *hugs* all around!
