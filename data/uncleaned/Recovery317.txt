TimescaleHi when or how long do you say you have beat depression?I am honestly thinking I can admit now and feel proud I have beaten this horrible thing, but part of me is still scared admitting it incase comes back with a vengeance,It's catch 22 situation but I feel great deep down really good I don't even think about It, I have a list of things that need doing which il do, I do still like to keep on top of everything and the house but I do that so I can go out and have my time , I've met new friends and I love life , I feel so positive even when things don't go my way I have a new way of thinking and meditation I feel so lucky and I appreciate everything and everybodyThanks
