I was diagnosed at 17 with bipolar and ptsd. ive attempted several times to get help but something ALWAYS happens(lose appointments, no tranportation,phone misplaced or stolen,have to abruptly move out of Residence)I've been used to the flash backs for a long time now but lately they've been little screen shots or clips of dreams along with memories. Bad or good but equally non-important. It was able to deal with the new assault on my everyday life but a couple weeks ago after a flashback I felt odd. Disconnected and distant. I tried to look around for something or someone to ground myself or in a way, bring me back I guessbut it felt like the things I was looking at weren't my own. It was a scary experience but the next day I woke up and felt fine a little hazy about the day befor.it happened again maybe a week or so later and now I'm starting to wonder with the ups and downs, anxeity, flashbacks, crazy fear of driving and socialization issues of everyday life without therapy or medication, is this yet another thing that I get to add to my " I'm just going to have to deal" list????? Advice, anything please.
