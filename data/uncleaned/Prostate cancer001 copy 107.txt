Cancer will not get me Joined this club almost three months ago. Wish I wasn't a member but resist the temptation to shout "why me?" because an equally valid question is "why not me?". On Zoladex since early November and so far have been lucky with the absence of virtually all side-effects (when I feel hot and bothered I put it down to my central heating which has been on full blast in the cold weather). Coping with the uncertainty of this illness is still very difficult, and will probably be so for some time until I can get used to the new certainty that my life is now much more uncertain than it used to be. I hope that realization will come to me eventually and I am working on it. Hell, PCa and all the uncertainty that goes with its treatment is a right b*s*a*d but so many other people have to cope with uncertainty in their lives that I believe, I am trying to force myself to think, that I am being delusional in wishing for a more certain life. My objective in life now is to manage this uncertainty, live with it, keep the flame of hope alive and enjoy life as much as I can. Do you remember that marvellous cancer sufferer, sadly no longer with us, called I think Stephen Sutton, who succumbed to cancer in his teens last year, but who said with pride that: "I've got cancer; cancer hasn't got me." That inspirational lad shows me how I should think about this disease.
