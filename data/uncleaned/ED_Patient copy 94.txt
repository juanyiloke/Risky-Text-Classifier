Am I beginning an eating disorderI have always been overweight even as a young teenager (but I was not as big as I am now)Also I have a history of depression, anxiety and PTSDRecently in the last two weeks I have begun throwing up every meal, especially if I have binged orgorged on meals, I want to be a mental health nurse so I know this isn't right but I feel so much better when I purge or vomit my food out.Am I becoming bulimic or is this just me being over-reactiveAny advice or help would be appreciated
