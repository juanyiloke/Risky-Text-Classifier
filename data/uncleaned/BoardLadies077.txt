your opinions please girls?Hi Ladies First time poster here in this forum  just wanted your opinions on the following. Went out to a friend's place last night, we were meeting up with a mutual friend who doesn't have many friends of his own so we didn't want to cancel on him despite the weather last night. I made a decision last night not to drink, I just wasn't in the humour. At the beginning of the night, she was putting pressure on me to drink, and then said something about vodka. I said maybe in a while but this was only to appease the situation. I had no intention of drinking. A while after, she was getting me a drink of the soft drink i had, and I could hear her opening what sounded like a bottle of alcohol being open (I can't see so i couldn't be sure till she handed it to me) When I tasted it, I knew there was vodka straight away. I lost my cool with her, she was drunk so she gave me a drunk hug and apologised, had to stay there a good while afterwards not to be rude to the other guy there. Herself and my oh get on well two which makes things awkward as well. Today she just text a normal text to which i didn't reply. She tried to call a few times then later on, and i text her saying i needed time to calm down that i was annoyed about what happened with the vodka and she's pissed off now that i'm annoyed about it. Something fairly big happened recently enough two which made me question our friendship but i was trying to get over that and was doing a fairly good job, and then this happens? It's just like crap on top of more crap. What do you all think? Am I over reacting or am I right to be annoyed?
