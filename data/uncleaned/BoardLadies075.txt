My legs aren't fat, I have lipoedema.....Hi everyone, So one of my guilty pleasures is reading the Mail Online I saw a very interesting article though: (Sorry, I can't find the proper link)Now, I'm a size 6 on top and 8 on the bottom because my legs are fat. My mum has always had big legs and I inherited them but it seems like it might be a medical condition. I hate my legs, no matter what I do, they stay 'fat'. It's weird, I'd always thought that it was just bad luck and maybe someday I'd lose enough weight and they would get better because my aunt is very slim and her legs aren't bad. Now that I've found this out, I'm not sure how to feel about it......What do you all make of this?
