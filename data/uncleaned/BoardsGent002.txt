Dental Hygienist "Woman's work" in Ireland and the U.S.?When I was in the military, all of my dental hygienists were men. They did a fine job. I looked into it as a possible career choice and was warned off by friends, family and those in field. The dentist even said I would have trouble getting a job, because most dentists prefer a woman exclusively.Is it for fear of perverts, who prey on children and adults when they are incapacitated?I've also been told that my hands are too broad and hairy. Not something that is going to be able to manoeuvre in someone's mouth.That job is one of the best paying for the amount of training time invested, would have liked to give it a shot.
