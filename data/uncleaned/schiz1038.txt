Is this schizophrenia?The other day I went to a wedding and my cousin asked me if I wanted to go and stay at her house on the holidays and then after she asked when I was driving home, I thought that was unusual what if she is going to do something bad to me but then I thought that's crazy and she's not out to get me. Then after thinking about it for ages I'm starting to think that maybe she and everyone else is out to get me but I know deep down they aren't and I just keep telling myself they aren't but I'm kinda worried that they are. However I'm more worried about that fact that I'm even thinking this because I know it's crazy. Ever since I started researching schizophrenia and the symptoms I've been convinced that I have it but does this sound like schizophrenia or just my anxiety playing up again?
