Im not afraid to commit suicide. Thing is some days when things get really bad i have the perfect plan for it. i try and find a way. but then in between i feel like i shouldn't give in, i should fight my demons. So my thoughts of suicide, are they moments of weakness? or my answer? Ive come to the point where i honestly dont care about my life anymore. i dont care where im headed, i dont care about people who come and go, i dont care what happen next. and those thoughts are what gets to me. i never used to be this way. i used to be stronger than this, i used to be strong enough to hold my own. but now i feel like a vulnerable kid who would be better off without having to put up with the bs of this life. i cant anymore. this **** aint fair. i did not sign up for this. ive turned to the man above several times but he just doesnt seem to be answering me.
