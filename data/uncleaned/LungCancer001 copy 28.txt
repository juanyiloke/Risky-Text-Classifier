Working during chemoI was supposed to start chemo/radiation last week but they did not want mardi gras to interupt it so I start Monday. I will be doing cisplatin/etoposide on Monday and then etoposide the rest of the week and then continue radiation for four weeks followed by another week of the same chemo. I have never had any symptoms other than a paralized vocal cord. I have never felt better physical wise. Should this first week affect me to where I probably will not be able to work? BTW, Since things were postponed for a week I ran up to MD Anderson. After all the test were repeated the only new thing I learned is that I am considered stage3. I am just trying to get an idea how much work I should schedule the next two or three weeks if any. Also, at what point does one usually expierence hair loss? TIA!
