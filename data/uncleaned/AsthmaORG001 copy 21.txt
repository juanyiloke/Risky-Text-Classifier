What do you do about friends who think that all people are as immune as they are?!A friend of mine at college came in the other day looking a bit peaky. She was itching and had some red spots on her body. I asked if she was ok and she said, so casually, "sure, it's just shingles". I feel bad now but I recoiled in absolute horror. She had been off for one week do I assumed she just had a cold or something and she would no longer be infectious on her return. But she didn't have a cold, she had SHINGLES. A little-known effect of shingles is the effect on people with asthma. Shingles can affect any organ of your body although it most commonly affects the skin or eyes. A friend of mine who has mild asthma ended up in hospital because she picked up shingles and it affected her lungs because they were inflamed. She 'only' has mild asthma yet she was on oxygen, nebulisers back-to-back, IV steroids and antivirals..I'm just worried now. I had only just finished a course of Pred. at the time and my asthma control has deteriorated recently so I'm assuming that the inflammation in my lungs is up right now. I generally have a greater susceptibility to infection than my friends as it is and I cannot believe her lax attitude to shingles! She would still be infectious for another week after that conversation!Should I do something? I want her to realise that she could easily have been putting people at risk and that I'm lucky that so far I haven't contracted it because I could become seriously ill! What do I say to her?!
