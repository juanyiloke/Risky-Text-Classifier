Travel InsuranceI've got a couple of weeks before the chemo appointment and as I'm pretty much symptom free at the moment I thought I might take a short break and get some sun on my bones somewhere warm - which this time of year pretty much means Dubai or similar. I even found a couple of pretty good deals on those last minute booking sites.Then the trouble started. I can't get any kind of travel insurance with having a cancer diagnosis. The normal sites won't even entertain me and I've checked the "We'll insure you for any condition" sites and they are fine *once* you've had treatment but if you just have a diagnosis and no treatment they don't want to know. Once site (Staysure I think) would consider it but need reams of forms filling in and letters from doctors (I can barely get an appointment!!) so no use for last minute type hols.If it were just to Europe I'd be tempted to risk it with my trusty E111 card but outside the EU it's a huge risk. I'm not worried about anything related to the cancer but if I get in an accident or something like food poisoning I could end up with a medical bill the size of Eric Pickles.Anyone experienced this and found a way round it.
