  Tummy TroublesTummy TroublesHi, everyone,I am a 29 year old female with stage 4 adenocarcinoma which has spread to my ovaries. The tumor in my chest, which is wrapped around some blood vessels, is stabilized, but I have several tumors in my belly that are growing. I have been told that my cancer is inoperable, but my belly tumors are growing so much that it's really uncomfortable. I feel really bloated, especially when I eat. What I'm trying to find out is, why can't they remove the tumors in my stomach, at least for comfort? Also, does anyone else have this problem? What can I do? Please help me.Thank you,Michelle.
