ÊPSTDI suffer from PSTD and it has not been easy for me. I am 50 years old and I was abuse by my father when I was young,cause no one believed me even my mom,so I ended up running away from there. Then I was in a relationship that was very abusive in anyway. That relationship has been over with. I am glad that this is here,cause I still need the support. I am in therapy and she has helped me alot. I live alone and have a wonderful cat. I just wanted to say hi and I am glad to be here.
