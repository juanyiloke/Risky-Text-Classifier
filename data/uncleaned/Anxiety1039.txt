Managing anxiety at workI generally manage anxiety at work well, but if something sets it off, such as failure to complete a task efficiently or errors, my brain gets foggy and all i can do is worry about everything. It also is hard to control irritation and overall crappy mood. How do I snap out of it?How do you guys handle anxiety at work? I want to progress at work, but have difficulty pulling myself together when i get upset and have bad anxiety.
