Changing jobs, but current employer being difficult________________________________________Hi everyone,So I recently interviewed for an exciting new job and received a call late on January 6th, asking me to start on January 21st. I handed in my two-week notice first thing the next morning (January 7th), requesting that I be given permission to terminate my employment to meet this start date. I have been in my current position for just over two years, and work four days a week.However, my area manager is being quite difficult. She is demanding that, because I will be finished with the company mid-week, I must work an additional two days between now and the 21st to 'fulfil my contract' for that entire week. That means that I will be working constantly from Wednesday 14th - Tuesday 20th January, and then barrelling straight into five consecutive days of training in my new role.Thing is, I don't believe I have a signed contract tying me to 30 hours a week. I received a copy of my employment contract a while back, stating that an audit had flagged up that certain employees don't have an up-to-date contract in their files. I've been very busy since then and honestly, I forgot all about it. I strongly suspect that their latest signed contract only ties me to 15 hours (two days) per week.I really don't want to burn bridges with my current employer or put them in a difficult position, but this has upset me. I have always been a very flexible employee, happy to change shifts at the last minute or take on extra hours to help the company. It's very frustrating to me that, given a really promising opportunity to further myself, my current employer is being less than supportive.So, my questions are:If my period of notice has me leaving the company mid-week, am I legally obliged to work the full number of contracted hours for the whole week? Even if that means working additional days in the previous week?Is it worth requesting a copy of my latest signed contract? And, if this contract only ties me to working 15 hours, can I legally stand by that agreement?Thanks in advance for the help!
