Scan Result - Some Good NewsHi all, not a frequent poster but thought I would let you all know of some good results. Had my first CT scan following the completion of my Chemo (12 lots of Oxy & 5FU) and I am pleased to say having seen the Oncologist last night I have come back all clear  I am having the summer to myself so looking forward to some decent weather. This will be followed by my Stoma reversal in the Autumn.Feel so relieved, but at the same time also feel slightly guilty that I am clear yet have lost some new friends on route :-\
