pea sized lump just above mastectomy scar¥	Hello everyone, I wonder if you can give me advice? I had a mastectomy on 3 March and got the all clear (it hadn't spread to the lymph nodes) and tonight in the shower I found a pea sized lump just above the scar.  This is not the normal hardness of tissue underneath - it's a definite little lump that moves when I feel it with my finger. And the skin is slightly "creased" or puckered.  Should I worry? Is it worth bothering anyone?  I don't know whether it's part of the healing process but the BCN did say to look out for lumps.  All advice gratefully received. Rosie
