I have come to believe that my fear of hallucinations is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more my mind is plagued with the fear of hallucinations that startle or scare me, the more likely my mind will respond by creating them. Recently, it's been very quiet, but reuniting with an old friend dredged up some PTSD-like stuff and fear from past experiences during the time that we originally met and were hanging out. I believe that if could just learn how to not be afraid anymore, I'd probably have less troubling hallucinations. If I believe that it's going to be okay, it probably is.I'm not in the same condition as I was during that period of time, but I have very intense bouts of fear due to traumatic memories. I have a problem with the fear of having a blackout while driving, and intrusions from my subconscious make it seem like it's about to happen. I'm also afraid that deep down, I still truly hate myself, and will subconsciously do these things to myself to torture myself. I was having offensive intrusive thoughts that reminded me of a teasing bully, so that makes me afraid of me. As far as the blackout thing, one time when I quit taking my medication, things were so out of hand that it occurred to me that I could trigger a hallucinatory blackout. That was 5 years ago, and it's still plaguing me.While driving, I'm afraid that I'll do that to myself, but remind myself that even if I do hate myself that much, I wouldn't take other people's lives in my hands.Sometimes there is transference- instead of fearing hallucinations, I freak out feeling as though I'm in great danger and every car on the road is going to hit me. Even my voices have tried to reassure me that everything is ok, tell me I'm okay. I wish I could get rid of all the fears once and for all! I did overcome a phobia of ladders at work and a few other stupid phobias like stairs. One step, anyway.
