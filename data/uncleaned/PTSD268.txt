Is it possible to develop PTSD from yourself?by ems » Sun May 25, 2014 9:52 pmOk. This is a weird question. Let me explain. I just had this thought, and wanted to ask the internet before making myself out like an idiot in front of my therapist. I'm a bipolar with a history of some severe self injury. I do 12 hours of intensive outpatient therapy, am compliant with all med requests, etc. And I'm making alot of headway, but I feel like I'm just completely obsessed with my previous self injury. I constantly think about my scars, and feel the need to touch them and hide them. Almost every night have these horrible nightmares about being maimed and cut and burned. And it drives me crazy because I don't even remember why I hurt myself! I only think about it in relation to PTSD because my therapist mentioned that because my treatment isn't working, maybe we are looking at it the wrong way. I don't know. It is just a thought. I just want answers. I want to know whats going on so I can be better.
