What do you eat before a workout?The other day, my boyfriend pointed out that I look a little squishy in the middle. (Gotta love that, right?!) But, he's right, I have gained 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) recently and now it's time to lose the weight and firm up for spring. Bikini season is right around the corner, and I doubt I could put a bikini on and still feel good about myself looking like this! I'm not overweight, not even with the extra 10 pounds; but my middle is squishy and I need to work out. I never really worked out before, but then again, I'm not as young as I used to be. Things are starting to sag! Anyway, my main concern is, since I never worked out before, I really don't know what to eat before a workout to keep from going too low. I don't really eat very much, I would consider myself a vegetarian (but not strict) and I don't use too much insulin lately, as a result. But, I have been getting lows lately, and don't want to risk it working out. What's a good snack before a workout to keep from going too low and make sure I don't go too high? Thanks so much!
