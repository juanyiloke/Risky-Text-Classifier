: How about a few uplifting and supportive threads?Lets hear the stories from those battling their way through recovery. What obstacles have or are you facing? How do they make you feel? Give yourself a moment, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Open your eyes and look at your surroundings and nothing more. Slow down and live. You can get better. You are not alone. This is why we come here. Reset yourselves, and start again. Learn how we all work differently and individually. Listen to your mind and body and ask yourself what you can do to recover. To smile. To be happy. Find your strengths. Dont concentrate on HOW the issues are affecting you. Think HOW can I do this for ME? I myself struggle daily, but Im not giving up. Im standing up and I'm fighting. For my life and my happiness.I am a man trapped inside of a females body. I am a lesbian. I have a family and carried our beautiful daughter. I have been diagnosed with BPD, depression, anxiety, post-natal and a few more. I cannot remember the last 12 months of my life. Our daughter is 5 months old. I have run away and abandoned my family a few times now. Out of fear. But I am more than this, and I deserve more. I love my fiancé, and I love our daughter. I plan to have more children with my partner. I plan many things with her. I plan many things for us. I plan for myself. Im not walking out again, this is MY life.This is YOUR life. Live YOUR life.
