Until this week I never really thought much about Schizophrenia or Psychosis. I knew the general meaning behind it, but never much detail. I don't know for how long, but I've somewhat often heard noises and the occasional voice. Mostly noises. Especially the phone ringing. I could be in my car with the radio on, and I'll swear that I hear my cell phone ringing. I'll check and 9 time out of 10 I'm not getting a call. Sometimes it happens at home when there is no background noise though. I'm noticed when I'm alone and left to my own thoughts, like trying to go to sleep, I'll hear strange things. Sometimes it's just a "WOOOO!" type of noise. Kind of like someone cheering for a sporting team. Now I know I have a strong sense of internal dialog, but this is sort of a step up from that. It's not something that I'm trying to think about. It just sort of happens. Now I don't hear voices telling me to do things. Nothing like that. I do think I hear a word or two from time to time, but they don't make much sense. At times I don't seem to have full control over my own internal voice. I might be praying, but my thoughts will throw in a "f*** God" type of statement which I'll immediately amend my prayer to attempt to apologize for. I find it odd that my mind betrays me in that way. It annoys me as it interrupts what I'm trying to pray. I can typically start to control it once my inner voice starts down that path. It's definitely my own inner voice and not that of something else. I used to think it was my own personal demon that I had to contend with. By that, I don't mean to say that I think I've got some evil thing in me, but just that it was something attempting to play with me. Does that make sense? These thing's don't stop me from living my life in any way, but I'm curious if they show any possibility of progressing in to something that I should be concerned about. Thanks in advance!
