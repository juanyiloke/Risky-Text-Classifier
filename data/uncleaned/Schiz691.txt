ÊCan I see a neurologist instead of a psychiatrist?I just started a new job and I'm struggling with trying to understand my medical benefits, and as far as I can ascertain it doesn't offer psychiatric coverage. It appears my company offers an additional set of insurance for "behavioral health", but that plan looks real crappy, most of the doctors in the provider list aren't even board certified. Can I see a neurologist instead of a psychiatrist? Is schizophrenia still considered an imaginary disease... how is it still legal for them to blatantly discriminate against specific medical conditions?
