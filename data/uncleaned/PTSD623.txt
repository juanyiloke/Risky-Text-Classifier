Some good help for PTSD following medical taumaPosted over a year agoMy PTSD was triggered by a cancer diagnosis, memory of surgery and treatment, and near-death from a dramatic puncture bleed after biopsy. So I tried many things. Talk therapy does not work for this. Exposure therapy (reliving it with a therapist) seemed sadistic. My doctor advised against it. What worked?EMDR -- an eye movement desensitization therapy done in the therapist's office. That and high doses of Zoloft (sertraline) -- at least 100mg a day but you have to start low and go slow. Strong scents when panic of flashbacks overwhelms you works too -- I mean ammonia or frankincense! Both are hard to carry with you so you need some fallback methods.
