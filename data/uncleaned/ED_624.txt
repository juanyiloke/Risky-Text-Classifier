torn (warning, kinda gross)I have been trying in my own ways to recover from anorexia nervosa for a couple years now.ÊI've struggled my entire life but it only became severe around 5 or 6 years ago. I'm really concerned about what its doing to my body; im not well, at all. I'm not a bag of bones, nobody ever comments at all, but I throw up when I brush my teeth nearly every day, I go back and forth between nearly diarrhea and constipation with very little normalcy in between. My stomach hurts all the time, I'm always cold and faint: I'm not fully sure if this has to do with another condition that is hopefully being looked into by a doctor. I sweat easily and my heart race is really fast. I get chest pains a few times a day as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and feet. Sometimes I'm too physically drained to eat. My stomach growls and growls but I don't want to eat. I'm always nauseous. I take two bites and I don't want anymore.ÊSometimes when I really, really want to eat, I can't force myself to. (I have to FORCE myself to) If I eat something hot, it'll make me sweaty and uncomfortable, so I have to wait for things to cool down a lot of the time.I'm currently trying to get something done about some of these and other unmentioned issues by a doctor, but I'm scared that it's JUST my eating disorder. I want help, I want to eat like a normal person, I want to feel healthy and full of energy again. But I'm terrified of ever going back to the hospital and I don't want to waste my time, but at the same time i knowI won't get better on my own; I have tried and am even still trying to no avail.ÊI'm scared and I want help.
