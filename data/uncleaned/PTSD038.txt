Always Feeling GuiltyWhy do I constantly feel guilty, about everything? I'm sure many of you have this same problem. The stupidest, most minor things make me have these episodes of guilt. One example: I had to ask my boss for an advance to get an apartment. Immediately after asking, I start beating myself up and saying to myself, 'Why am I such a failure that I have to resort to this?' I genuinely feel like a terrible human being over this. Yet I know it's nothing all that extraordinary; people ask for advances all the time. Why oh why do I constantly do this? Have any of you guys gone through this and come to any conclusions?
