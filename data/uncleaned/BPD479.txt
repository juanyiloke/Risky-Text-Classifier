Êcould I have BPD?I have different personas to me not like dissociation where I don't remember them I'm very aware to put it in example is like a actor in characte . I have unstable emotions especially lately I'll snap in fits of rage and get random euphoric moments for only a moment. The type of person I want to be and morals change constantly on whatever influences it. If a guy doesn't message me back and I really like him I get really upset because I feel like he doesn't wanna talk to me. I'm very self destructive and don't have a concrete self image. I want to be loved and sfored and put my value on peoples focus on meAnd if I do have BPD does this effect me from ever being able to get into working in the mental health field .
