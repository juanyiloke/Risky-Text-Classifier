Prince HarryHi just wondered if anyone had any views on the recent deaths of 2 brave US service men who died at the same base as Harry is deployed. I was appalled at the report that he was moved to a safe place and was never in danger, who is going to tell the families of the 2 that died that there was no safe place for them. I really wonder if he should be there at all if it means that other service men and women are going to be put in danger.
