Should someone with mild asthma still have the flu jab? So it's getting to that time of year again and I'm wondering if I should have the flu jab. I have mild asthma ( I only have symbicort and ventolin) and have never had a proper attack or flu. I was only diagnosed two years ago, but it's likely I've always had it (I'm 19) according to the nurse given that I have a history of breathing issues.Last year the surgery I was with didn't receive any of the vaccinations until december. I was offered on but refused as it wasn't convenient at the time. I'm a student and had a two weeks of term left, full of exams and assignments. As I always feel unwell after jabs I didn't want to risk it!Personally, I don't feel that I need it and I don't want to have one when people need it more than me, but I also don't want to be stupid and refuse it and then end up unable to breathe!!What would you do in my situation?
