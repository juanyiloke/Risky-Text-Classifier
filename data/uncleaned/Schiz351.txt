When people here post about how strange they are, how many problems they have, how no one believes they have mental illness, maybe they don't have it. Maybe they just have character flaws, such as, being lazy, being apathetic, being withdrawn by being stuck on themselves, having a bad reputation, not being able to succeed because others don't trust them. There are any number of things that could be attached to a person that don't actually qualify as mental illness.
