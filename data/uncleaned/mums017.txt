My toddler quite likes brushing her teeth. The dentist has told me that I should be brushing them for her until she is quite a lot older, and I do every evening (letting her do them more herself in the mornings), but it always creates a massive tantrum as she wants to do it herself. She is ok at doing them, and enjoys it. Should I keep on battling to brush them for her or should I let her do it herself all the time?Until about a week ago dd would fall asleep within minutes after going to bed between 6.45 and 7. Now all of a sudden she isn't settling til 8 or later and I can't work out why! Nothing has changed. She hasn't napped for almost a year, she has the same room, blackout blinds, routine etc. I just can't work out what's going on. She's not waking up any later to compensate for going to sleep later either.Â Does anyone have any ideas on why or what I could do?does anyone have any experience please? I think we are almost ready to take the side off DD's cot, and looking at our options, as I think that she is likely to fall out pretty regularly as she moves around a lot. I think she is nearly tall enough to climb out, hence us thinking about taking the side off.Have seen foam wedges that kind of go under the sheet, or a traditional bed guard - does anyone have any recommendations or advice?Thank you!
