  New Here- Asthma and OTC interactions??________________________________________Hi guys. I'm new here. I was wondering if anyone else has concerns about using otc meds with asthma. Last Oct i had sore throat & bronchitis-used cough medicine and Tylenol Sore throat med and ended up in the hospital with severe asthma episode. None of the Pulmo's in the hospital or my own dr would agree that the meds caused my attack. They said those meds are perfectly fine to take-the labels say do not take if you have asthma.This week I was experiencing the same symptoms. This time I took claritin. The box does not warn against it and nothing I read on the web warns against it. I almost went to the hospital again. Fortunately, i now have a nebulizer which kept me breathing until I could see my dr today and get steroids and antibiotics and steroid nose spray.anyone else experience this or is it just me?thanks!Ag
