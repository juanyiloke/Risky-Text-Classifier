I know this might sound like a really silly question, but I few things I've read on MN over the years have made me think about this.Should kids (more particularly girls) wear pants at night under their pyjamas?The thing is, I always do. But I've read a lot on MN about people thinking that's weird and that just pj's are fine. DD has very recently started being dry at night so I've put pants on her instead of pull ups but then this thought struck me. What do other people think?
