Asthma and a bad CoughPosted 3 months agoHere we go again with the cold weather and cold and flu season,as normal i have been and had my flu jab but last saturday i came down with a stonking bad cold which made me feel terrible.With my asthma nurse's permission i upped my symbicort to 2 puffs day and night to combat it but it is still proving relentless.Managed until Tuesday and the coughing started which has made me rely on my Ventolin inhaler more and more, could not take coughing anymore yesterday so went and saw my asthma nurse, she said my chest is clear despite me complaining of: tightness and finding it hard to breathe, using my ventolin 5 times yesterday, hurts to cough and i have a sore throat. she phoned through to my doctor and explained what was happening, he said that i needed steroids and a dose of antibiotics called doxcycline. started those today didnt want to wait until after the weekend.Trouble is as everyday goes on i am feeling worse. I am at work and everytime i talk for extended times i cough and have to drink to make it ease.any advice please??
