Symbicort inhaler and the number of doses in turbo inhalerPosted 3 months agoHi This is something which has bothered me for some while.  I have mild asthma and have been on Sybicort 2puffs twice a day for some years.I have always felt that once the red mark appears in the window I do not get a full dose especially as sometimes my chest feels a bit tight.  It always corresponds with coming to the end of the inhaler.  I know that on the instructions it state that once the red mark shows at the edge there are 20 doses left when red 120 doses left and when the 0 is on the red it is time to start a new inhaler.  I thought it's maybe a coincidence. Now my husband has been diagnosed with possible COPD and using symbicort same dose and over the last couple of months he has said to me that he feels he is not getting the right dose once the red shows in the window as he is feeling even more tight chested.  Sorry to have rambled on just wanted to know of other peoples experiences with symbicort.
