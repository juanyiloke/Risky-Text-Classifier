World Cup chat threadGame 1 Brazil Croatia.Definitely a couple of hometown decisions. I was glad Neymar wasn't sent off at the time even though by the rules he probably should have been as I think too many matches in the previous world cup were ruined by soft red cards.But that penalty decision was criminal. Croatia were hard done by.Really looking forward to Spain Holland tomorrow. Has to be a Spain win, doesn't it? Actually I reckon they would both settle for a draw as both will be hoping to come out of that group
