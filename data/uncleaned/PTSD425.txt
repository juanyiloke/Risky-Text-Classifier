ÊPTSD?Last year, on April 1st, I woke up with appendicitis. Had an appendectomy and sent home. On April 5th, I really wanted to get oit, and I could comfortably walk. So my older sister took my lil sis and me to the mall for a bit. It was only a fifteen minute trip, but I was exhausted.ÊSo on the drive home, I fell asleep. When we were just a mile from the house, I woke up to the sound of tires on gravel. When I looked up, we were starting to drive off the road. I saw that my older sister had fallen asleep at the wheel. I then shouted, "Don't over correct!"ÊI knew that if I woke her up, she would probably jerk us back on the road. Even though I said not to, she over corrected. We ended up rolling the vehicle three times until it cam to a stop. Upside down in a barbed wire fence.ÊI came out with a concussion and badly messed up neck and back. My sisters had messed up necks and backs too. The reason we made it out alive is because we were wearing our seat belts.Since then, whenever I get into a vehicle with someone else driving, I end up reliving the accident in my head. Which leaves me to being almost paralyzed with fear whenever we kind of go close to the edge of the road. I have also find that I stop breathing. Could this be PTSD?
