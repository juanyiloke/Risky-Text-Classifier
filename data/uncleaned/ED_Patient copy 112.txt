helphi everyoneI'm a girl af almost nineteen years old. I have been bulimic for more then three years. I still am. I'm in my first year of college, I study interior architecture, it has always been my dream! But I never thought that I would still be bulimic, I thought everything would be fine if I went to college. I don't know what to do anymore, I need help, I think it's horrible what I do to my body. In the past I already went to doctors and I went to the psychiatrist but I stopped going because I found it useless and it was really expensive. It means my parents knew about my problem (I told them after I was really really down ) . My mother was devastated, she didn't understand. Later I told her everything is fine with me , and that I don't purge anymore. She still thinks I am but I'm absolutely not, I don't want to ask for help because I don't want to tell her, it'll break her heart and I want to study and finish college and not go to doctors or hospitals. I'm looking for people to talk to, who deal with the same problemslots of kisses
