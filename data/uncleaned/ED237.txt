ÊVery Angry With MyselfI was having a perfectly good day yesterday, and enjoyed my uni classes last night, but for some reason when I got home I was craving a binge, and I went nuts on ice cream, a massive chocolate bar, and a big bag of Doritos. Why, why, why did I do that? And now today I haven't gone out and exercised at all because I got an email notification from my hydro bill saying they hadn't received my last payment, which I sent in the mail over a week ago, and they were threatening to cut off my service. So I spent a bunch of time dealing with that, and now I am having a hard time motivating myself to go out for a walk to burn off some of what I ate last night. I am very angry with myself, and very stressed.
