I know it sounds superficial, but my baby's ears stick out! I still think she is beautiful, and in fact, i think it gives her character, but i'm afraid she'll get teased in later years.As her ears are still bendy and soft, they often fold when she goes to sleep, if she has leaned that way etc - will this affect how much they stick out? When will they harden like ours?!Also, do you think they just stick out because she has no hair, or will they always appear this way?Has any other parents had children who have had the ear pinning operation? This is not something i would choose to have done, but if she chose it herself in later life, then i would allow her to have it if the risks were minimal...
