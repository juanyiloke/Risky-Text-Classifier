I'm wondering whether to update my childrens collections a bit, in terms of playmobil and lego mostly as my dcs birthdays are so close to Christmas and I feel that we need some little extras to keep them going over the next few months. It seems like such a long time to wait until next Christmas before refreshing what they've got. Not thinking much, perhaps a couple of sets so £50 approx. Bit of a random one but I'm curious to know what others do in this situation? Do you tend to buy your cd little bits throughout the year or do they have to wait until Birthdays/ Christmas? My dc are 5 and under so don't get pocket money yet x
