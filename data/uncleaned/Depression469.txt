Most Difficult Time In My LifeÊ  minnesotadespair ,Ê27 Apr 2015Where do I begin? I am having a real hard time. I feel terribly depressed. I can barely function. Just brushing my teeth takes willpower. I constantly feel like I have no energy and motivation. I see things that need to get done and I accomplish nothing. Almost like I'm paralyzed to move. I have battled depression for the last 18 years. Antidepressants drive me crazy and don't work. I'm in the darkness and the people I need the most, my family, abandoned me. So I battle this illness and I'm alone. I have a hard time making friends when I'm depressed. I think about this illness and life everyday. It's like a puzzle I can't figure out.Ê
