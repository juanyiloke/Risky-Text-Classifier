Hi, I'm new to the group and just found out yesterday that my daughter's medication (Maxair) is scheduled to be discontinued in December. She used to to use the Warrick/Armstrong cfc albuterol, and really had no good luck with the hfa inhalers (some made her cough more) when came out. For most of the time, she uses her Maxair as a preventative before exercise, but she has used it when she has a sinus infection, cold, or bronchitis to keep her open. I'm looking for suggestions to bring up to her allergist. He wants to try her on formoterol as a replacement, but I've read where that is not to be used as a rescue inhaler. Any suggestions would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance and thanks for adding me to your group!
