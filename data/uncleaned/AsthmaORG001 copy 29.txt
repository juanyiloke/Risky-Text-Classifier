Allergies - anyone have tips for dealing with throat swelling and sudden tight chest? Hi all, I'm hoping somebody is able to give some advice... So, having finally got over the coughs and colds the allergies are making an appearance! My throat has swelled up now to the point I'm finding it hard to talk. I can swollow but painful. One of my eyes is puffy and red too but the main reason I'm posting is because I'm wondering what else I can do without taking the dreaded steriods. My chest keeps feeling like someone's sitting on me thankfully my fostair inhaler is, fingers crossed, keeping any potential attacks at bay. I've taken the antihistamine telfast which has helped a little but now doesn't seem to be giving much relief. In the past I've usually had an attack this time of year and been on steriods. I'd really like to get through the Spring/summer pollen without needing them this time! Anyone else have this problem this time of year?
