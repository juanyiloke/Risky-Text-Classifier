therapy grouphi alli have been accepted on to a Diabetic therapy group starting on april 7thwe meet 1 time per week for 90 minutes. initially for 30 sessions.quite excited about it really as it will offer a place to talk through some of the mental health issues that are inevitably associated with a long term chronic illness.i believe there are 8 people in the group plus the dietician moderator ( also has mental health qualifications ).will let you know how things go.this is also a stepping stone to co-moderating another group in the future.
