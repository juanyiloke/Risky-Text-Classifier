Male grooming/personal hygieneI'm a young guy but I'm pretty hairy, like everywhere. In particular my chest and lower stomach area, i'm not really too worried about other areas. But i'm considering shaving all my chest/stomach hair just because it's annoying me and it looks messy and horrible.So, what is the best way to shave it without being itchy as f*c* for weeks? And i'd love it to stay away for a while too! Which probably wont happen...
