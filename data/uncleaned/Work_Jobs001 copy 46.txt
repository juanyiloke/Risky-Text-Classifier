Is self esteem ruining job prospects?________________________________________Hi guys! Just wondering what your thoughts are on the following ....Is it possible to actually be afraid/fear work?? ... through no confidence/low self esteem? Years ago when i was in 6th year , i pulled out of school 3or4 weeks before the leaving cert exam. I remember feeling stressed and convinced i was going to fail and i just gave up i guess. I later found work in a call centre and again, 6 weeks in and i quit. Its difficult to explain why.I just remember feeling that i wasn't good at the job where as everyone else that had started with me knew exactly what they were doing etc I have virtually been unemployed since. However, i often look up jobs as i feel i WANT to work (especially now more then ever as friends etc have settled down and im here broke and can't afford all the things i would love to have) ... but anytime i see a job no matter how handy it may be, I talk myself out of it because im convinced i won't be good at it .Now i don't want to play the 'poor me' card but my mam suffers with anxiety and i personally suspect she may have bipolar or at least another serious illness because she was always abusive to me growing up depending on her mood.I was often told i should have never been born, that i was the worst of all her children etc and often heard her saying things no kid ,or adult in fact, should have to hear! No idea how nor why my dad tolerated her but he did and life went on and here iam now .I cant help feel that she is largely responsible for my low esteem and ultimately i feel thats why i have no confidence and feel unemployable. I was also spoiled growing up by my dad who i suspect may have done so to make up for the mother i had ha but this didnt help either as i lived too comfortably (money wise) when i was younger.Im now in a situation where i have no idea what to do in order to over come my fears and get myself a good job! I considered college but again, talked myself out of it. I convinced myself that anything i wanted to do would be too difficult for me to learn and i'm useless at studying. I have been to counseling before ,not to discuss this subject specifically although it was discussed and his advice was more or less "if your living comfortably then relax,dont worry about work, you will work when you are ready and need to" which at the time made sense but that was 3 years ago. When the hell am i going to be ready? Starting to feel that im doomed to the dole for life and im never gonna be able to attract the relationship i want, the holidays i want, car , house etc At 29 im still young -ish but not for long.I feel the next few years are vital that i take some sort of action but what do i do when i have such fear , have absolutely no idea what i want to do with myself or what im even good at etc ? Its almost like i have no idea who i even am to be honest . I mean is it not ridiculous that i feel i want to work but don't understand why im not working. Or that im 29 and have no idea what im good at at or what i would like to do? Am i just lazy or do you feel there is genuine reasoning behind it and that im being held back by certain issues ? I had for a while thought i may have social anxiety or a possible personality disorder as alot of the 'symptoms' matched how i feel however i sometimes go out with friends n stuff so i assume that it can't be social anxiety .... although i have always felt iam not great at interacting with people socially inc my friends but im not shy, nervous etc I just aint great at making conversations and being the person that makes people laugh etc Sorry for the long post, just thought someone might relate or have advice on actions i need to take.
