So TiredI have had chronic anxiety for 30 years I am now getting so tired of getting through each day,I get up in the morning feeling light headed and nauseous 24/7,I still manage to go out food shopping but feel as if I am floating around the store,I have to force myself to take my dog out,I have ringing in my ears constantly also,I have had all the different medication and every form of treatment there is but nothing has helped,there is no help out there,I am totally fed up with this unseen condition.
