I overcame it! With ponies?About 3 years ago, I signed up for a forum, and there werehuge trolls. And I mean, my brother was the lead moderator, and even he was mean to me. They started saying, "Leave", "Kill Yourself", "Nobody Cares", and, "You faggot."I considered committing suicide 1 year later, and that's where I found this forum. So I started a topic herehttp://www.suicideforum.com/showthre...Ugh-Aspbergersand I was really considering suicide. I got comforted a bit.1 year after that, I was introduced to a show called My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic via my friend. He told me to watch a few episodes, later that week, I did.I did not know that this would change my life. As I watched the show, I started to get happier and happier. And then my brother finds out, and he makes fun of me. BIG TIME. So then I was quite disappointed with myself. I didn't think I was worth living for.On our way to a restaurant, I witnessed a convention going on, and I saw a cosplay of my favorite character. My faith has been restored. I tried to convince my dad to let me go to a convention, he kinda was iffy about it, but then I told I would be going with friends, and I knew the dangers. He let me go.At the convention, I hosted a panel. I started feeling better about myself. Way better.It was the best experience of my life.As I left the last day of the convention, I reflected upon what had happened. I was proud of myself.I said on my first day of school with a My Little Pony shirt on, "I like My Little Pony. Deal with it.", so yeah I got a few chuckles, but not really anyone made fun of me.I cured from about to attempt suicide one day to feeling really proud of myself the next.I am proud of myself.Thanks!
