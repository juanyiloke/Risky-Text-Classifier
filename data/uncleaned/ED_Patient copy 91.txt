i think i need help?i can never eat without feeling guilty. All though im a size 8 i look in the mirror and see this massive fat blob. every time i eat i want to rewind time and starve a little longer. I hate feeling this way! I want to not care about gaining weight, i want to enjoy food! I can hear anorexia calling me! I have in the past gone through a month of bulimia, i stopped as i still felt guilty after throwing up! I want to be a normal teenager! Ever since the age of 10 ive been calculating calories and checking i havent gained weight. i cry every time a size 8 feels tight. My mum doesnt understand, Nobody understands. I have no one to turn to. I need help and especially now as i feel myself getting worst! I want to be normal, to think like a normal teenage girl!
