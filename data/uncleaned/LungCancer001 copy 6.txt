Going into uncharted territoryThis story started early in December with a sharp pain in rt side and a trip to emergency room on 12/19. One or more cracked ribs the Dr said. 10 days later pain has not lessened so I went to my GP who ordered a CT Scan. Ugh! A lesion, swollen lymph nodes, and a suspect area on a rib. A 2nd CT scan and rib biopsy was ordered. Waiting on results at this time I decided to join a forum for education and here I am.
