 When do the flashbacks stop?I got into a very serious car accident on August fifth(2+ months ago) wherein a man committed suicide in front of my car. I haven't gotten my car fixed yet because I do not have the funds and the cracks in my windshield remind me everyday of my horrific accident. I still have panic attacks when I am driving in congested areas And I was just wondering if anybody could help give me some insight as to how much longer these flashbacks will torment me for. My therapist has officially diagnosed me with PTSD and general anxiety disorder. I'm just ready for my life to go back to normal
