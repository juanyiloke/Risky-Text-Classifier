ÊHi, Im new. Is this PTSD?Hello.ÊI'm a 37 year old single mother with depression/anxiety disorder, and I'm trying to make sense of my issues as of late. Not exactly sure what is going on with me, or what to do.Recently, I have ended a six year relationship with a man wo is diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder and a sex addict. We had a family together, and all seemed well. Until I discovered his infidelity and sexual escapades behind my back, and the fact that it had went on for years. Also, he was aware of his diagnosis, chose not to persue treatment for it, and was literally a different man when I wasnt around. As a result, I ended the relationship, and lost my family. I still feel terribly betrayed. I had NO idea he was like that, or even diagosed with tnese things.Since then, I've been struggling to at least be "okay". Depression has me bogged down enough to the point that Ive not shed a tear in months. I dont leave my house much at all anymore, and friendships are dwindling. I have the worst nightmares and I avoid sleep to avoid them. Certain songs, places, people, even movies trigger painful memories, and get absolutely gut sick from it. It's like Im emotionally reliving that devastation all over again. And sometimes there is no trigger; I mentally get stuck in that moment for no reason, go tnrough emotional hell, then go straight to cold, malicious rage because Im suffering. I shut down and isolate. This happens every day. And I hate it. Not sure what this is or what to do. All I know is that Im miserable and cant handle being alone at the moment.
