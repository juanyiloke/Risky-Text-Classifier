I'm not asking for help on how to kill myself, but if anyone could let me know if this will fail or what might happen please let me know? I decided to cut myself and put antifreeze on my cuts. I just thought of the idea as I was cutting my thigh this morning. I thought if I do that each day slowly I'll get poisoned. Someone mentioned it's painful. I'm really not sure, except that I know antifreeze works by causing kidney failure and it only takes a small amount. I'm thru, I'm done, I have so much hate inside, everything I love goes away or is negatively affected by me, I have absolutely no future, and all I think about every day 24/7 is suicide.
