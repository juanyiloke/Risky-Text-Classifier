hospital stayas you know not had insulin for a few days due to new surgy well wedneday my support worker said this is not good enough im taking you to your gps. we saw the nurse who took my bs surprize surprize its to high for machine to read and i have ++ketones so nurse says you need to see a gp now . the gp takes one look and says im admitting you to hospital now. she wouldt let me get a taxi up there and insisted on calling me an albalance which was there in 15 mins. i get to hossie and my bs is 32. they keep me in overnight gave me fast acting insulin on top of my normal insulin. today i feel a lot better and my bs is 9.3 i have never felt so ill. saw my professer while i was in there and he wants to test me for cushings sydrome when he sees me in clinic. its at times like this i realise how lucky we are to have the NHS
