Hi. Hoping this is the right place to post. I have a very clever and strong willed son that is not taking to it in the slightest. He is 2 years 4 months. We introduced the potty by allowing him to choose a Thomas one as he seemed ready , telling us when he needed to go etc. trouble is he then decided that he didn't like the potty - namely as he didn't sit comfortably on it. We started by allowing him to sit on it in front of the TV when he felt he 'needed' a wee or poo and mentioned a reward if he did his 'business' which he was eager to do but never actually did the deed. We then decided that perhaps he wasn't ready so thought we would wait until our trip to Australia to see family. Thinking he could go nappy less on the beach with potty to hand but instead he just played with it and wouldn't sit on it. Coming back we decided to try the seat on the loo. Thinking that being a smarty pants he sees us on the lol so this would be more familiar but he's now gone backwards in that he doesn't tell us when he needs one or even when he's done one now. He has taken to every other hurdle like a duck to water as in going from cotbed to toddler bed etc but this we are at a loss Tbh of all the 'parenting ' things we have to go through this is the one thing that I just have no idea which is best and thinking that as he's not taking to it , the two may be linked. I'm not keen to rush him but at the same time he is moving up a class at nursery after April ( where the majority of his peers are already trained ) and I have another baby due in June so would love him to be trained before then with the new baby don't want him to have too many 'changes' if that makes sense. ( we're also moving too! ) We're obviously missing something. So parents any help/ tips/ advice would be very greatly received. TIA ( sorry for the essay)
