Going back to workTomorrow I'm going to try and go back to work. I'm on a trial phased return.I've been looking forward to this for weeks, if not months. I thought it would be good to think about something else for a change other than bowel cancer, see people other than drs & nurses and go some place else other than an NHS establishment. But as tomorrow approaches I've butterflies in my tummy. I'm not even sure I can do my job any more.Did any one else feel like this if they went back to work and did it help you at all?Ruth
