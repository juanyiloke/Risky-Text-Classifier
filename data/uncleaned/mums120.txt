This is probably going to sound like a silly problem. DS2 is 18 months. He doesn't walk yet (just like his brother!) and hasn't got any words yet (apart from Mama, Dada, more and Baba (brother). However, he knows what he wants, in a big way, and his way of communicating with us is to screech the loudest, most ear-piercing screech you've ever heard. I am struggling to handle it. It brings me to tears most days. My DS1 is 4.5 years and is also loud. The screeching on top of the shouty 4.5 year old is getting too much. I am trying to ignore the screeching until DS2 says "Mama", and then I turn my attention to him and what he needs. Ususually he is pointing at something. I know he is frustrated, I just feel silly being unable to handle this. Does anyone have any tips for helping him find the words to express himself without screeching?!
