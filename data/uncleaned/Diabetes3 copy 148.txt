Have you ever been asked what your diabetes strategy is?I've been wondering over the last few weeks about how my experience of diabetes care differs from others. Since I was a mercifully well creature before the diabetes, my experience of the medical establishment was limited to a very progressive rheumatologist and a GP, all of which was Ok, but I don't have much of a benchmark.Any how, I was thinking about patient led care quite a lot and wondered why nobody has ever asked me what my management strategy is, I mean literally never asked. Injecting insulin is probably a given, but nobody has asked what I want to achieve (aside from the staying alive element which is also a given), by that I mean the level of control I'm looking for, or the compromises I'm willing and not willing to make. Has anyone else been asked about their self care strategy?
