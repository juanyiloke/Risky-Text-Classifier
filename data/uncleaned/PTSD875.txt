 can Trichotillomania be associated with ptsd?i have been diagnosed with ptsd, as i suffer from flashbacks after long term abuse, during these flashbacks i pull out my hair. I never thought about doing it before it just happened. since i have seen a documentory about trichotillomania and discovered i have had symptons for years for example i have twisted and played with my hair since i was in nursery! so i was wondering if anyone else knows of anything similar to this? is it heard of? anything asscosciating would help. Feel quitte alone with this
