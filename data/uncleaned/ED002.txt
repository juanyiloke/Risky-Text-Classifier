How ridiculous am i being?Okay, this might sound crazy - though I can't be the only one who's thought this...There's an outpatient eating disorders program that I've been referred to...but I haven't gone yet. The reason is because I'm too scared I'm going to be the biggest one there. That people are going to look at me and think I don't really have a problem, or my problem isn't as sever as theirs is...I know im sick. I've lost a lot of weight recently and have been battling an eating disorder on and off for ten years and.I actually can't stop my eating disorder behaivours when i try. I know I need treatment...buuuut I'm so scared to go and find out Im the biggest one there. That's my biggest fear and why I hadn't gone yet.I've been to an outpatient program before, it was for people under 25 years old, and I liked going to that...but there weren't groups at that one. At this one I'm thinking of going to there are mandatory groups...Has anyone felt this way and have any advice?
