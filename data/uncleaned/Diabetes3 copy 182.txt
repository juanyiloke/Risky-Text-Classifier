Frusemide and weight gainHi I wonder if anyone can help.I have been going to Slimming World for a year now and have successfully lost 3 stone (or so I thought).However this 3 stone was lost in the first 6 months of last year. Since July I have lost nothing just playing the game of 1lb on and 1lb off.I am now very active - running about 20k a week, tennis, gym etc and eating as healthy as I possibly can. I tend to eat clean now adays as I find my performance at activities is hampered if I eat something I would call naughty.So I am doing the right exercise and eating well but as I say since July nothing has happened weight loss wise. I still have another 3 stone at least to lose.Now the only thing I can put this down to is about the same time as the weight loss stalled I was put on 2 frusemide per day. The frusemide I know can make a difference of up to a stone in weight loss! I am now thinking of asking the GP if I can try coming off this as the swelling is no where near as bad as it was when put on it.I am wondering what your thoughts are on whether Frusemide can conflict with the bodies attempts to lose weight? Any advice would be appreciated? Any scientific explanation as to why it would cause weight gain would be even better
