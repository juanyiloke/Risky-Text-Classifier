Feeling a bit out of placeWell as the title says. I do not seem to be diabetic any more, have almost given up testing, can eat whatever I like. For example today went for pub meal and had 1/2 chicken, ribs, chips (plate full), choc fudge cake and ice cream. Bloods came out at 1hr, 90mins, 2hr, 3hr as 6.8, 7.2, 6.2, 5.4 BTW first time I have tested in a fortnight. As you know my last 2 HbA1cs are 35 and 33 whilst eating high carbs. So where do I go from here? Do I continue to give advice given that my experience is going to become further and further in the past? Should I just become a "social member"?Additionally @daisy1 can you consider providing links in the basic information to useful pieces of research such as that for the Newcastle Study, Southport GPs paper so that the newbies know there is some hope instead of just the standard NHS "its progressive and you are just going to get worse" crap that is spouted - no wonder people arrive here depressed and lost.
