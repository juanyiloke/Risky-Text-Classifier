Diagnosis after job dismissalHello, I'm keen to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience or can advise on the legal position with what I've been through.I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in September with a secondary to my liver. When I met my oncologist who had viewed my scans they were of the opinion that I could have been living with it since September 2013.In December 2013 I moved jobs and was on a probation period for 6 months. During this time I complained throughout of being tired, generally not feeling well and on a few occasions was sick and suffered from severe stomach pain but put these down to bugs. I was seen by occupational health who felt I was suffering from some level of anxiety and suggested counseling.The work required me to produce results to a highly accurate nature. During reviews I was accused of deceiving them during the selection process as I was not living up to how I had sold myself or would on occasion produce work to a high standard getting results when I was bothered. I always resented these suggestions as I had carried out the work for 4 years previously with no issues but could not provide an acceptable defense to explain my performance. At various times throughout the 6 months I would state to my line managers of my tiredness and feeling of unwellness but this did not carry much weight with them and having been seen by occupational health allowed them to say there was no medical reason for my poor performance. At the end of the 6 months I was dismissed.Clearly now in hindsight during all of this I was suffering from my cancer.In comparison to beating cancer this isn't important but I would like to know if I have any right against unfair dismissal with new information being known or request that HR add this to my file and can inform in the future any potential employer that my performance was compromised by an undiagnosed cancer?ThanksSteve
