have i??   do i have symptoms of diabetes??? For 10 wks now i have been having dizzy spells and aching muscles. I couldn't walk far because i just went dizzy and tired. My weight has dramatically dropped without trying and i am thirsty all the time. I get the tremles and shakes and my eye sight has got a little worse. I have had every other blood test known to man but never a diabetic test. Tonight i was feeling very sick and suddenly tired and dizzy. I laid down on the sofa and had a glass of coke. Within 15 minutes i felt much better. All i want to do is sleep. I have had mri of neck and ct of head to rule anything out there but that was all fine. I am very confused.
