Ashes to ashesWas asked by our 91 year old widowed neighbour (no family) to be with her yesterday as the undertaker was delivering her husbands ashes.  She  was in an extremely distressed state as you can imagine, which no amount of comforting platitudes could allay.  The arrival of a tubular container accentuated her grief.  Eventually the realisation that the small container was her Ken set in, and after the undertaker departed we discussed where she would like him.  I suggested in front of his computer where he had spent many hours, which calmed her and where he was placed.We sat chatting and managed to get her back via happy memories etc. but the question of how do I know they are Ken's ashes almost flummoxed, ny only resonse being we have to trust the integrity of those involved.  Will be popping in later this a.m., but would appreciate fellow forumites views on the subject.
