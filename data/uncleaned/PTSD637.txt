have i got ptsdPosted over a year agoabout 6 years ago i was attacked by a neighbour wealding a machetti knife,there was no reason for the attack and after the trauma.there was a court case which cutting this story very very short i thought would be the end of living in fear as like i said it was a neighbour that the attack was from.anyway as th eman was a tennant and obviously had broken certain conditions of tennancy.ie causing a trauma but in housing association wording thought that if he got a criminal record the housing association would do there bit and start eviction preceedings after the outcome so i settled for a lesser charge which was still an offence and he would get a record as to be honest i was scared to enter the court and give evidence against this person.we settled the lesser term in the witness protecting room in the court via a solicitor but didnt actually go into the court room itself to have the case heard.so i thought i had one really and justice would be done after as he should be removed and me rehomed and begin to start a new life away from where it happened.however while i think the man in question got 6 months suspended sentance if he did anything else i was awaiting for the letter from housing association letting me know about his conviction and of course my fresh lease of life.my neighbour was allowed back to hios house directly opposite mine after the court.obviously for my own safety i was living with my partner elsewear.i shuddered and had bad anxiety attacks if i ever had to go to my place to collect mail etc.and tended to sneak in around the back which luckily i had a rear entrance.other things in regards to trauma had happened since court case one in which a healthy puppy aged 8 months suddenly died after being such a handful bit of a nightmare to be honest dog so full of life that needed the patients of a saint luckily i had this to deal with her.it turned out that the housing association didnt evict the man and when i asked why they didnt even start eviction proceedings there reply was we feel happy that he wont do it again.the whole inncident was more traumatic than the event as this man had only had a 60 pound fine and uncondiotianal 6 month thing to which i dont really understand.so i was at my place as they also never offered me a suitable accomodation place unless it was miles away and i was suffering with depression so needed my family close by and also the only doctor i could confide in.so decided to try to live my life as normal.course this didnt happen as he was still opposite my front door.i had been shopping one day and as i said b4 my highly strung dog had greeted me at the door looking half drunk and i thought ah shes just woken up as it was evening so quickly picked her up and put her on my bed and settled myself in bed for my sleep.she was still the same next morning so took her to the vets where she was tested wheni collected her she was very drousy and the vets said her test was negative and she was sedated so me thinking all would be ok couldnt wait for her to come round again.was at my mums and she was on th esofa the dog i mean nicely covered and after a few hours she opened her eyes and began to awaken so i steadied her into the garden incase she wanted to pee and she had a fit collapsing in my arms again.i grabbed her and rushed to nearest vets where she was on a drip and i thought she would be ok as the previous vet had given her some medication which knocked her for six.and once the blood was cleared shed be fine again.she however didnt make it.which crippled me totally and then after recent events i gave up on life i guess.where was the justice and why has this happened to me is all i could think.i really struggled with raising this dog being the handful that she was a staffordshire bull terrier red one anda apparently they are real trouble when young.she was my first own dog raised without any family help as i had always had dogs but while living at parents so it was different i guess as i had to prove i could do it and be bloody good at raising alone.as i was told id fail by various family members b4 i got her.so u can imagine how distressing her death was as i didnt manage she died,not my doing i know but as i didnt have money for a cat scan or anything being now on benefits due to trauma i never knew what killed her only a thought after some months later seeing a tv programme about poisened pets and how they died rang true with her symptoms and of course immediately thought of this neighbour.will never know if thats how she died or infact if he did poison her but will always know how she was and become over the space of those two days b4 her death.i constantly check my spyhole at my place if ever there is a noise incase neighbour is at home and i freeze if i hear any noise i think its a fight or something even if laughter noise or anything.never knew ptsd exsisted until a while ago.this happened 6 yrs ago and my life is decayed to the point where i now am living with things piled to my front door for security and my once beautifully kept flat is now a dumping site where i have to step over things to get to anything and ashamed of it so obviously no one has ever seen it how it is and i havent the strength to fix it anymore as its really overwhelming.never had counsilling over event or help to be honest.this week i may be getting evicted too as i should of had a boiler serviced but due to the state havent let the housing repaires people in due to sheer mess and have really tried thinking i can get it sorted b4 too late but have failed.and bury my head in the sand or get away from the mess by sleeping in my car where to be honest i feel safer.DO YOU THINK I HAVE PTSD IF ANYONE CAN RECOGNISE MY SYMPTONS THIS IS MAY BE THE LETTER THAT CAN HOPEFULLY CHANGE MY LIFE AND GIVE ME SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TOO IF I CAN BE CURED OF COURSE.I JUST WANT MY LIFE BACK BUT FEEL ITS NOT EVER GOING TO HAPPEN
