waiting game¥	So they found my alien(lump) with a mammogram .waited 2weeks to go for biopsy ,then a week for results,I have to wait 4 days for the docs to meet and talk and decide best treatment .also need another biopsy,that could be next Wednesday then it will be a week for results.¥	I can understand they need to know the whole story before they treat me .but this waiting game is so hard to play.when all you think about is the alien invading your body.I just want it out and to start treatment.¥	My surgery is ? May 20th not long really but when you can't sleep and every waking moment has the alien looking over your shoulder .sorry for the moaning but it helps to vent.
