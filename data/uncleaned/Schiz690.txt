ÊNeed advice about possible abuseI need some advice on whether I should ask for a therapist because of my past.ÊWhen I was younger my dad used to beat us. He would smack us over and over as hard as he could while he screamed at us. He'd do it if we did the slightest thing wrong. My most vivid memory as a kid is him chasing me up the stairs and I curl up into a ball half way and he bears down on me for ages while I cry. He would make me and my sisters sit and watch while he did it to the other sometimes. We would beg him not to and he would scream at us and just do it as hard as he could. I was terrified of him. My mum would just stand and watch while he did it. My dad was actually investigated by social services because of it.ÊThe way they treat me about my problems bothers me as well. The first time they saw my scars we were on holiday abroad in a restaurant and my mum started screaming at me saying what the hell are they. When they found me making myself sick they had a 'talk' with me. I didn't think I had a problem. All my dad would say is that I was upsetting my mum, that's all he cared about. Then he dragged me up to my room and started trashing it right in front of me while I begged him not to. I ran downstairs to get my mum and she just grabbed me and wouldn't let go so I tried to get out the front door but it was locked. After that they did nothing to get me any help. My mum would periodically 'check' my arms but that was it.ÊI still have problems because of how they treat me. When my dad says he loves me I don't believe him and it makes me hate him. I hate my mum for not doing anything about it too.I need to know if people think this classes as abuse, and if I should talk to someone about it. I've never talked to anyone about it because my memory suppresses it until something triggers the memories. Thank you for reading.
