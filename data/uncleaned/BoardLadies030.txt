Teenage PMT symptomshey ladies, looking to help out my neighbour. Her daughter has got tough PMT symptoms. She can get quite anxious and her moods are very tough to deal with. Would anyone have any suggestions of any thing that she might be able to take to help her symptoms. The teenager doesn't like to take evening oil of primrose but anything else she is willing to try.Êthanks
