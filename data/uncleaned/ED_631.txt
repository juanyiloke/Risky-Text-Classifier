Is this an eating disorder?I've always had troubles with food. ive gone through points in my life where I've not eaten much and others where I have eaten a lot and then gotten sick. I've had points where I excercised maybe a little too much sometimes.ÊI've never been underweight and at the moment I'm fairly overweight. I've been eating too much at times and then at the next available opportunity excercising a bit much. I don't really know what's excessive though. And I am a little prone to downplaying problems.ÊMy doctor said that she thinks I need some help with managing food and I have an appointment with a nutritionist tomorrow and I have no idea what to expect.ÊThey gave me a form to track what I've eaten for the past few days and it has a section on it for comments and I don't know what to put there. (It was delicious? I was disappointed with the flakiness of the crust? Next time I will add cinnamon? Ran out of yogurt and was sad? Grabbed chili powder instead of paprika? These Popsicles did not have puns and will lodge a complaint? I joke, but seriously.)ÊI am afraid that the nutritionist will not let me have snacks, because the idea of not being allowed to have food really scares me - to the point where I will often go eat a lot just in case there is no more food ever again.ÊI would ask my boyfriend to come with me but he is out of town and I can do it myself anyway.
