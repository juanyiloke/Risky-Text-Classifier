Home at last but lostI don't know why I feel so lost and lonely this morning. My daughter spent the night here last night- she'd been to a broadway show- an 8 hour drive from her school so she cut the return trip home and stayed here. I didn't get to see her until this morning and it surprised me how loving she was to me. My MH has taken a toll on her-especially during her adolescence and she didn't understand so she felt very angry and sad. She would avoid me and call me crazy and the like. I was heart broken because she paid the price for my depression, agoraphobia, etc. but this morning before she left, she hugged me and told me she loved me. I don't know why I am crying. I wish I had her back here in my arms. I have felt so often she hated me but perhaps being on her own at uni has helped her in some way. I have often felt my daughter was lost to me. But these intense feelings are too much to feel. I wish I was not so emotional.
