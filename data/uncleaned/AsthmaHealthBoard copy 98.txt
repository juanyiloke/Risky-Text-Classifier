All year!!________________________________________All year round I have problems with my asthma I am on dulera 200/5 two puffs two times a day! I can tell when I am due for my next dose of dulera. My and my asthma dr have been trying to get me stable enough to be able to drop my puffs of dulera or moving me to a different daily med but we are unable to get me there. Every time we switch the dose my asthma gets worse. I seem to be allergic to everything in every season. However spring summer and fall are the worst for me fun I know seeing as I love being out doors lol. I can already feel it starting. I haven't had a sever attack in two years and hope I won't have one this year I just get nervous when things start up early. I do take a Daily allergy pill in the mornings it worries me as well because my son also has asthma and is on Flovent two puffs two times a day. I have also added in doterra oils to see if that helps. I will admit that the peppermint and breath does help during an attack if my inhaler doesn't work. I got a diffuser so I can have it defused into the air whenever needed!
