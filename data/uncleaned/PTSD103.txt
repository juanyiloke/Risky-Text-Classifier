Very Unstable, Confused By MyselfHello, I have something I would like to ask you folk.Do you also percieve yourself as very unstable in times of stress? What I want, if I want something, how I want it changes with the wind. It is driving me nuts right now. Life has become uncertain and stressfull again, and I feel like I am losing myself. I suffer from CPTSD cause my first 20 years on this earth were suboptimal and after quite a peacefull time live, with all its stressors, has begun again. I am not doing so well.One moment I believe playing videogames is a nice thing to do. One hour later I am disgusted by myself for being a lazy pig, two hours later I wonder were that silly self-criticism came from, and then I do not know what all the fuzz was about, games are boring. Everything goes from good, to bad, to neutral and I feel like I am losing my sense of self. I tried to write a letter to someone, after I was done I had to delete it, cause I already was not the person anymore who wrote it. Read it and thought "Where the hell is this coming from, I do NOT agree with these words."Isolated myself again, as I feel like the only thing that comes of it is me being afraid and emberressed of how I behaved, how I have shown myself, a few hours earlier. Even my dreams become very chaotic in nature, from nice to horryfing and back.Is this my dissociative disorder going haywire? How do I stabilize myself. Should I just make peace and accept it? Unfortunately therapy is months and months away.
