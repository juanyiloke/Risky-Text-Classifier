Jury Duty________________________________________I haven't been called for jury duty myself and I'm self-employed but I'm posting on behalf of a friend (with their permission).They've been called for jury duty and work in a very generic job which definitively doesn't fall under any of the reasons for being excused. They're one of many people doing the same role.They brought the notice into their manager who has threatened them with being fired if they don't come up with a way out of jury duty and told them that this is a verbal warning and if they don't come to work they'll get a written warning and be fired and that there's absolutely no way the company will pay them while on jury service!I assume this is illegal?They're wondering if the jury service office could do about this? Or what the next step should be?It puts them in a pretty awkward position to put it mildly.
