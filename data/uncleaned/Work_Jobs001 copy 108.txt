Working part time 1 year now given no work________________________________________Hi the situation as it stands is ive been working in a retail store for the past year. I booked holidays off months in advanced for the new year as i go away management wore fine with it. I let them know i was back and ready to work 2 weeks ago, was told i would be put back on the roster and given work that week.2 weeks later i still havent returned to work and im really stuck for cash now. Is there anything i can do ive spoken to supervisors in the job they say they cant do anything for me that its the owners decision ( small business ) If anyone needs to more details let me know. I dont what to be doing here, im basically being left without work but told i do still have a job ?
