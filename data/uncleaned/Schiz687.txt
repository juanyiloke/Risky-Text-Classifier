ÊAvolition vs not "trying"I tried explaining to my mom just now how last night I experienced a sudden surge of what was a familiar feeling of what was probably avolition. We were out walking and it became nearly painful to walk. Every step was haunted by needing to stop and just sit with my head between my knees forever and never move again. My dad ended up picking us up and driving us home. But today my mom has been completely unsympathetic, "If you tried you'd be able to! Do you know how many times I thought I couldn't do it and I did anyway? Raising a family and working you have no idea what it's like! What's the worst that could happen if you just tried!" How can I explain that the will to even try is gone? There's just nothing there. It's impossible to "will myself" to do anything when I'm like that. She doesn't get it and got really upset with me. Am I wrong? Is it possible to just push myself through when it hits hard like that? I feel very alone right now. No one seems to really understand around me what it's like having to go through what I've been through and they don't make any effort to. I've more or less recently found out my whole life has been my mind playing tricks on me, it feels like everything's been ripped up under my feet, all my beliefs and all my self confidence and sense of self have been one big fat lie. But no one even tries to understand what my symptoms are like. Everything is fine to them. All you have to do is try harder apparently and everything will get better. Everything I tell them there's a rebuttal for. It doesn't help that I've really noticed my cognitive abilities are not what they used to be so it's harder for me to keep up with everything they say. It isn't bad enough that I'm sick, no one believes it either and I can't defend myself. Ok venting over :/ Oh well I do feel a bit better just venting it out.
