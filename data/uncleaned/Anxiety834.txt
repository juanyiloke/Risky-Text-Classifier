How do I talk to my therapist?I have had one session for my anxiety, which was concluded that I have mild anxiety which may not need treatment or therapy. I have a re evalution soon, just so she can check up on me. My issue is my anxiety is making it difficult to tell her what I really want to. I told her about some mild panic attacks and anxious thoughts and a breif history with self harm and eating disorders. I need to be able to tell her about the suicidal thoughts, fear to leave the house, numbness, severe panic attacks, constant self-harm. I know what I would want to say, but I know when I am face to face with her again I will laugh it off and say 'I'm fine'. I have gotten so used to having to hide it I don't know how to actually say it, and I begin to panic. I want to get better, I need to recover. All advice and tips would be extremely welcome. I am starting to lose sleep to my anxiety about this, I don't want to waste the opportunity.
