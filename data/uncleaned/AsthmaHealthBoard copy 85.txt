Seeing Pulmonary Dr. first time.________________________________________Hello, Recap: bronchitis -(asthma diagnosis) pneumonia .Clear chest X-ray couple weeks or so ago. Went to my Doctor Thursday because I am experiencing continued SOB ,chest pain and pressure. Inhalers do not seem to be working. So she is sending me on to see pulmonary Dr. I am going for a breathing test on Monday (today is Saturday) and to see doctor on Thursday. Would appreciate any knowledge about what to expect or what I can do to prepare. Like will they runs stress test before they check my breathing? If I sit in waiting room it may not be the same as when I am active or using my voice a lot.
