Neuropathy¥	Hi can anyone help, I finished chemo 3weeks ago, during the chemo I had mild tingling in my fingers of my left hand ,and numbness, for the past two nights I have been woken up during the night my whole hand is dead and numb ,so bad it had me in tears last night, it took ages to get any feeling back in it, I have looked at a few Internet sites that suggest it is caused by the treatment and can be worse at the end of treatment and take maybe 6months plus to get any better , has anyone else suffered with this or should I visit my doctor , any help would be really welcome ,Thanks Amanda
