Feeling alone and frustrated Advice please- feeling very alone! I was diagnosed following a viral infection 5mths ago and struggling... CT scan is all clear, other tests are clear (phew!) but I am currently on my 3rd course of steroids since December following yet another exacerbation... Hospital say its stress..... I am a shift worker and have been for 5yrs.. I love my job- I work front line for the ambulance service- and apart from the viral infection nothing has changed in my life for the last 5yrs... my previous illness consisted of migraines and I have not needed antibiotics for 15 yrs previous to this!!! My first ever chest infection !!!! Hospital today ( I'm only ever seen by a respiratory nurse!) now say i need to make life changes and reduce my 'stress' by giving up work!!! And thats really simple and obviously won't impact on any further stress ( sarcastic tone !!!) Financially I need to work and emotionally I LOVE my work !!! Work have been excellent and are very supportive ( unusual I know for NHS workers!! Again sarcastic tone!) Does anybody else out there feel frustrated with the lack of help from the medical profession? Im being told I'm not showing signs of typical asthma! And I need to wait to see the DR if I get an exacerbation as they hand steroids out like sweets apparently... but after 5days of being breathless and on day 5 being unable to complete more then a 3 word sentence I felt I needed some help!!! Would be nice to hear from anybody who feels frustrated with similar situation... I feel very alone.. part from work colleagues and family who can see how unwell I've been....!!! Medical professionals make dreadful patients .... but I hope I can say I would never want my patients to feel likeI do at the moment when I attend to them!
