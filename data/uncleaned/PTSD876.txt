ÊAnother scary hospital experienceI woke up this morning from a very convincing dream in which I met my daughter and my grandmother in the afterlife and it was beautiful, no pain, no suffering. They wanted we to stay and told me it was time to stop hurting. My grandmother, who is one of my idols, told me it was the right thing to do as I have been putting so much stress on everyone else that it's become too much for them now. I wake up and I am instantly met with a flood of suicidal thoughts aimed point blank directly in my face. I try to convince myself it was a dream but fuck me, I would have given my left arm to go back that place.ÊI ended up calling the county crisis line and spoke with a woman about what I was dealing with and she eventually convinced me to go to emerg to talk to a psychiatrist. I was extremely relectant as I have an intense fear of doctors and medical facilities due to loosing my daughter to that vaccine, but she was lining up a small team to meet me there and was advocating on my behalf to prep them for my unwilling visit.ÊWhen I got there I was met with the same resistance that triggers my panicky shittyness and I felt misunderstood and attacked.... And I never got to talk to the shrink. They tried to keep me overnight and they wouldn't hear how that would make me even more upset. They were making me feel trapped and I had to put up a huge fight to go home with my dad. I want help, I really do but every time I go into a hospital it is an extremely traumatic experience for me. My dad finally saw first hand just how upset I get over all I this so I think he understands a bit better which is nice. But how can I accept help from the "people" that I feel are responsible for the death of my child? How can I trust that? How can I get them to see that that is my first step. They want to "cure my suicide" but I'm not letting them in.... How???
