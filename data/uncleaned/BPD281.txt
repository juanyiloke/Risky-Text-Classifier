ÊBPD and MedicationLast year I was admitted to Hospital but only as a Voluntary Patient due to 5 overdoses....I have OCD, depression and got diagnosed with BPD. I got given a Care Co-ordinator who was really nice and then it changed to another lady who I just don't get on with.ÊI missed numerous appointments as I am finding it difficult to leave the house, I missed a few GP appointments and my GP send me a letter voicing her concern as she is wondering if I am unwell and wants me to re book an appointment.I'm supposed to take Fluoxetine 60mg but I stopped taking it a while ago. It's just not working and I've been on it for ages. As I wasn't taking my medication they CMHT took me off 30mg of Mirtizipine......I have an appointment on the 16th and I really don't want to see my CCO as all she asks me is 'what can I do to help you?' and I came away in tears last time.ÊThey have suspended my therapy appointments as I didn't go to my last few appointments and I just feel like there is no point now. I don't think the therapy was helping....but they said I could do DBT but not anymore as they suspending my appointments.I just can't face going out due to the OCD and I don't like my CCO and I just have a bad feeling about her....not taking my meds as it's not working so I don't know what to do.Thanks for reading!
