body image thoughts?Does anybody have suggestions for how to start to address body image issues? I feel like I truly have a lot of hate for my body, and I think about my body almost 100% of the time. No matter what I'm doing, who I'm with, I'm aware that my body is fat and disgusting. I wish I didn't have to feel this way or think about this all the time, but I don't know how to have hope that it could change! Does anyone have any suggestions or relate to this at all?
