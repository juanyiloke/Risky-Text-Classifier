I have PTSD and I was abused as a child and have abandonment issues. I am currently floading which is the arrousal. I get scarry uncontrollable thoughts with my arrousal, I obsess about my symptoms contantly and just dwell. I have been floaded for over a year now it's getting better. I just seem to have some agoraphbia when all this came on. I stay in my house and dwell. I ended an abusive relashionship which triggered all of this. I have weird dreams with this. Was looking for support from someone who has PTSD I feel a alone in this.
