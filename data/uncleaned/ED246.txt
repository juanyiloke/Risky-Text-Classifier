ÊScared About Holiday FoodIn the last 6 weeks or so I haven't over-eaten or binged as much, and I've actually managed to take off a few pounds of excess weight. But now the holidays are here, with Christmas dinner on the 25th, and a second Christmas dinner on the 28th when our whole family is able to be together. Also, on the 27th we will be opening gifts and having high fat foods like chicken wings and cheese ball with crackers. I am terrified of having to face all that food. And then my mom wants to take me and my sisters out for lunch one day. I really wish Christmas wasn't so much about feasting and over-indulgence.
