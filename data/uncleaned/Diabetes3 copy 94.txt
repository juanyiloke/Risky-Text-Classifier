Health SetbackHi, I haven't been on the forum for a couple of years. I was diagnosed Type2 in January 2012. I had good support in the last 3 years from my Dr and I have maintained a good HbAic reading at each check up. I am on Levothyroxine for underachieve thyroid and also on Atorvistatin to keep my cholesterol in check. I have always had good BP all my life and it was one positive thing about my health. However, at my recent check ups my BP has been borderline and last week my Dr had to start me on BP tablet. I have been under a lot of stress for the last 6 month as my mother in law has Alzheimers and her health is deteriorating and me and my husband are her main carers. All this has led to me not looking after myself properly and getting really stressed out at times. I am totally depressed that my one good health point is now needing medication. My Dr gave me a card with Diabetes UK web address which reminded me that I am still a forum member here. This has really knocked my confidence and my HbAic was up for the first time since I initially got it under control. My hair is falling out in handfuls and have a couple of small bald patches. It's happened before and grew back in again, but I am really struggling at the moment. Sorry to be so negative, but only diabetics will understand what it's like. I have two good friends but they just don't understand. I'm sure many of you experience the same thing. So wishing everyone who is battling the disease at the moment a big hug. xx Belladonna
