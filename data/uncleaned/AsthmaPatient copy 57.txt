Which sleeping tablets are recommended for asthmatics? Hi,I have a bad cold virus and am struggling to sleep. I am also occasionally asthmatic which is currently causing problems as it has been worsened by the cold virus.Is there a sleeping tablet which does not affect my asthma? I have seen that 'Nightnurse' & lots of other meds are not suitable for asthmatics so I want to know suitable meds for asthmatics who also have :(i) cold viruses & flu symptoms(ii) insomnia (this would be when !not! related to any cold virus)Any ideas?
