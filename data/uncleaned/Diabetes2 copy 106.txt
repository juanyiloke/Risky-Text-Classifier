Diabetic Rash   I've just been diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes but looks like I've probably had it for at least 18 months. I have a rash on just one of my legs but on both feet. It's itchy, red and is purple at some bits. I had a biospy taken (not received written confirmation of the results yet) but the consultant said she thought it was a complication of Diabetes. Apparently, they don't know why some people get this rash and others don't. Does anyone else have any experience of this rash and how it's treated? The only thing I've used to treat it so far is Hydrocortisone and E45 cream which are both useless. Any help would be appreciated.
