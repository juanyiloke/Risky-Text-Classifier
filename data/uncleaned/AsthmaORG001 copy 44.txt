Coughing up mucus!! (Sorry!!) Soooo, Maddie is now 6 and has finally learnt how to cough up!! Hurrah!! We have struggled for years to try and clear her chest, using saline nebs and physio predominantly. She has now realised how to cough up. She's really struggling at school though as she says she can't do it there and quite often feels the need.....How do you all cope when in a public situation and need to clear mucus?? Or do you wait etc?? I've got moderate asthma and only get this feeling at night, whereas Maddie is brittle and gets it most of the day/night.
