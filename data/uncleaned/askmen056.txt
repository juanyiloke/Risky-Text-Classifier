How to ask for a demotion...2013-08-01, 09:47 AM…without looking like I’m trying to slack off and get into a job that’s easier and has less pressure and stress where I can just coast along? Incidentally, that is exactly what I'm trying to do, but how do I spin it so that it sounds a little better? It doesn’t help that the job I want pays a good bit less than my current job (which doesn’t bother me, but might raise eyebrows on their end).I actually have a part-time second job doing pretty much exactly what the lower position I’m trying to get demoted to does. I’m thinking of going with something like, “I’ve been working this other part time job and really enjoy that type of work, and I was thinking I’d enjoy doing that full time, but I like working for this company and I’d like to stay on here.”Any other, better ideas?
