Metformin and HepatitisHas anyone heard of metformin causing hepatitis?I have just had my annual check up and was called in immediately as there was a problem with my liver function test. Apparently the normal number is 30 and mine was 300. Im not sure what that means exactly. The GP ran through a load of possible reasons; eg alcohol, drug use, supplements. All of which i could answer no to. Then she said metformin could have given me hepatitis. Surely this is madness?!!The plan is to test again in a week and hopefully the result was just a one off.Any advice would be welcome.
