Anyone else having the same problem? My 8 1/2 month old isn't really interested in food all that much, I've tried Ella's kitchen pouches she refuses the spoon. I've tried cooking food myself and purŽe she refuses that, I've found that she does prefer to feed herself so any type of finger foods she has a little of but not enough to fill her up.Am I expecting too much from her? A friend told me food before 1 is just for fun, but I keep thinking well she'll be one soon and won't eat more than 3 mouthfuls of anything ððÊAny advise for a head strong baby who refuses food greatly appreciated
