Lung functiom issues  2  Had Spirometfyvand lung volume tests last week. My lung function is gone down to 40%. Its not the lowest its been but its not exactly good. I have ended back in hospital but am hoping to be let out later on....but every time i ask how i can get my function up again they say i just need to rest and give it time...at this point they seem to have run out of ideas for me..i am just really concerned now.Does anyone know of any ways to increase lung function?? Thanks.xxx
