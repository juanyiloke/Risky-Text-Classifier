Indonesia executes drug smugglers.Here's a controversial one, what do you think?Me, I think well done Indonesia for standing by your principles in ridding your country of this abhorrent trade. You have always made it abundantly clear that this is the fate of anybody trying to smuggle drugs into your country.If all countries took this stand we could rid the world of this most evil of all crime, dealing in human misery!
