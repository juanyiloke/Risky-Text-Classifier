A ladies ageQuestion for the other guys. Ladies feel free to chime in too. Why is it inappropriate to ask a lady her age. A lady asked me my age the other day. I told her it was none of her business simply because I didn't want to talk to her. I was slated for refusing to tell her my age. Is it an equality issue or not. Should men refuse to share their age too, or should women not shield their age.Not interested or just out of your league?So do you guys ever feel if you are turned down by a very attractive girl, its because she's "out of your league" or does it occur to you that you just happen to find that person attractive but they don't feel the same way.I still here some people raving on about this said quote, but is it just a dramatic movie quote that was blown out of proportion, or does it often hold through to life?
