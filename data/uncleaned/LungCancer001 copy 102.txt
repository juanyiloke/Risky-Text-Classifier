Retired Living in Ontario CanadaHello Everyone. I am a retired female living in Southern Ontario. I am right in the midst of the myriad of tests most everyone who is suspected of having lc goes through. Although I do not have a definite diagnosis yet, the Doctors are fairly certain it is some type of lc. Have a spot also on an adrenal gland and my thyroid. Its funny...when I headed for my first ever scan I was absolutely terrified, out of my mind with fear. Now I could fall asleep in them if they didn't make so much noise. I'm scheduled for lymph node removal Sept. 10 and a needle biopsy later, in addition to some other stuff. Other than one meltdown last Friday when I came home to find I had messages for 3 more procedures, I've kept it together pretty well. In the next few days I will list tests I've had as I see other members have done. Meanwhile I would love to hear from anyone, and for those who are scared of those very first scans, perhaps I can help calm your fears just a bit. Our time in Canada is different, but I will probably check in every day or so. Best wishes,
