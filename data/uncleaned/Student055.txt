Left uni early, hit with fees!by ArtificialCrayonHey people,I left Bangor University on the 20th of March according to the statement I signed (Was around then I stopped attending lectures) and I didn't leave the uni accommodation until the 25th of April. I knew I'd have to pay something back as we were told when applying.Now I wasn't aware i'd be paying back almost 3k that I just don't have. Because I didn't leave until late April, my accommodation fees have been taken out and when I applied for a refund they want to keep 4 weeks in advance on top of the days I've stayed for so I'm only getting little over £200 back. This means I have very little to pay back with.I left uni early because I'm retaking my first year elsewhere and decided to go home early for personal family reasons and to get a job so I can save up for next September so I'm not living skint for another academic year. But at this rate my wages once i get a job are going straight into paying this off and well that's a real burden.Is there a way I can lower this cost through some way like appealing or speaking to someone, phoning up Student Loans just offer me a Direct Debit option, making paying it off more realistic but it's still a lot of money I don't have. Thanks for reading.
