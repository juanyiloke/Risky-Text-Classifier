Diagnosed with type 2 brittle asthma, but currently struggling with severe chronic symptoms I was diagnosed with type 2 brittle asthma about 20+ years ago. I take a cocktail of meds to control my asthma, however over the last few months following a very severe attack, I have had repeated chest infections and I am struggling to maintain a stable PF currently 250 and below (normally 450+) and I am experiencing frequent severe exacebations 4 ITU admissions in the last 4 months.I can't exercise even walking up a flight of stairs is a struggle. I am feeling seriously miserable and isolated. Is there anyone out there that knowswhat I am going through that can advise. It is seriously "doing my head in!"
