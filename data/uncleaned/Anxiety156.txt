is this anxiety normal? will I ever be happy again :( Ê14    Iv post natal depression and anxiety and I feel lightheaded all the time and feel unease in my own skin. I feel like I'm floating sometimes and things seem unreal. Sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind and need to run run run in panic its awful. I'm top scared to be alone. Soon as I open my eyes I'm hit with it! Anxious over nothing but constant. Been on sert 6weeks at 50mg a week at 75mg I get moments I feel OK which is in the evening when I'm just sat with my husband watching TV but just getting up to wash the pots sends me into a lightheaded brain spin
