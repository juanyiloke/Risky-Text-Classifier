Allowing the OH to pay more rent than youHey folks,Just wondering if I could get some opinions on an issue I'm currently having.ÊThe OH and I recently decided to move in together and rent a one bedroom apartment.ÊWe both initially agreed on a limit as to what we could afford to pay in rent. We've been to view a couple of places since. Although one was nice (the landlord went with a different couple instead), the majority of places are either too small/not in a nice area/or just kind of crap. This prompted my OH to suggest that we look at upping the limit as she'd seen some places advertised that looked a lot nicer than what we'd been to view. I made it clear that the limit we'd originally set was the absolute maximum I could afford.She then suggested that I could just pay half of our original limit and she'd make up the difference herself. She's in a position to this as she's currently earning more money than I am.ÊI'm very uneasy about this. I really don't like the idea of not paying my fair share. Also I feel like there may be a sense of the place would be more "her's" than "ours" if she's paying more than I am.Am I being unreasonable or stubborn about this?
