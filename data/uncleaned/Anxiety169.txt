It only takes minutes before i go into despair Ê15    What a difference a few minutes can make living with acute anxiety, I have been allright today until I started to read the alegations of who i am supposed to be in a housing trial where i am supposed to remain for 3/4 hours and expected to remain calm and collected at all times.I feel so alone right now when my home is at huge risk and how i have discovered through the court files prepared by my landlords solicitor that are full of degrading and painful lies that do not belong to me nor are a part of my character .I am trying to kill my pain with meds for the distress I feel in tonight but feel I am again sinking into that deep dark hole and am being buried alive by a gang of thugs without having the truth be told.I feel hopeless and unable to go through with this day in court in less than 3 weeks.I would rather die than face a barage of missiles and amunition that is directly aimed at me.How do i cope with all this /I have been asking myself for months now and still there is no real answer.I wish my heart would stop beating and all this deep pain will go away forever.This is my hell.
