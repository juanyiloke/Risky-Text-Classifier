Frightening neuropathy resultsI'm feeling pretty deflated after my hospital appointment this morning   I had my toes fused back into their sockets as they were all dislocated when the bones in my foot fractured and displaced due to Charcot foot and today I went to see how they were mending.In between getting a new plaster cast for my leg I had some neuropathy tests done including the filament test. I have got feeling in my foot, pain, hot, cold and although it has changed I didn't think it was too awful. I couldn't feel the filament on any of my toes or down the edges of my foot. Really alarming waiting for someone to do the test only to be told they've finished, especially when I am currently injecting a drug to try and save that leg from amputation.Even with good control I can't seem to slow down the express train of complications I set in motion and I'm at a loss to know what else to do. Please do everything you can to keep yourself well, ensure you have regular podiatry tests and never ignore any problems with your feet however small.
