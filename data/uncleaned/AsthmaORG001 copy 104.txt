Newbie...not knowing where to turn next worsening asthma Hey everyone,I'm new here but thought it would be great to get some additonal advice!To put you breifly in the picture; I have suffered asthma mostly all my life. I say suffer but i've not had any bother with my asthma since I was a teenager...until now! Since about may/june I feel my asthma has slowly been worsening causing me be off work more than once a month - the first time ive been off in 8 years! At least every 2nd-3rd day I have an increased narrow chest sensation sometime increased breathlessness. When it gets really bad I have had to atted a&e for nebulisors and go on steriod tablets for a few days. Its now effecting everything, I have difficulty sleeping as lying down can make it worse, showering can be a problem - I try to shower with the glass door open to let some of the air out even if it is a cooler shower. What i've done so far;Attending my asthma clinic/nurse regularly (however to be honest I don't feel i'm getting far), Increasing my preventer on weeks I feel very bad,keeping a regular peak flow diary,seen a physio for breathing exercises (which have helped slightly so i'm please with that however it does not slove the problem completly) tried my own self care methods i.e propping up my mattress at night, having an ice pole etc, gentle exercise My symptoms don't seem to be improving and I was wondering if any one had any advice on the next step I should be taking?Thanks :)
