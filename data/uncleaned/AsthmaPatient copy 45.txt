Asthma Occupational - RADS & IIA Hi I am feeling like the only person in the world with this disease because I am struggling to find others to share information with - yet I read there are thousands of adults diagnosed with Occupational asthma each year.I inhaled chemicals in my workplace and it left me with Occupational Asthma (RADS &IIA) and the traditional asthma medication (symbicort- alvesco etc) - do not work for me - in fact it makes my breathing worse. :-(I would love to hear from any other people who have Occupational Asthma. If you happen to have also been exposed to chemicals it would be great to know what medication is helping you .. if any etc. Anyway .. it would be just nice to chat to others with this horrid condition.I created a youtube video and website - out of desperation to find others with this condition so we can share information and offer support.
