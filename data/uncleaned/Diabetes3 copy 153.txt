Meds finally changed againDon't know if I am coming or going. The specialist DN has know left the practice   and I was referred to the community nurses, who without speaking to me bounced me back to the doctors    .I had an appointment this afternoon and behind the scenes the community nurses and the doctors finally agreed with me that gliclazide was the wrong medication for me  . Only taken 2 to 3 years for them to agree with me.As from tomorrow I will be starting on Sitagliptin 100 mg once a day, I know nothing about this medication and looks like its another wait and see time.Mean while my levels are hitting the 20's again which is really annoying as the pain in the feet reaches new peaks. I also have had to have a 24 blood pressure monitor on me and the peak level it recorded was 193 / 167 with most of the reading being well above what they say is the max threshold of 140 /80. Will be seeing the doctor on Monday about this.It feels like its back to square one and the beginning yet again. Apologizes in advance if slow on replying to any replies as still running on very limited internet, hence my absence from the forum.
