Poll: Problems with the smartphone forum app?Up until the last few weeks the smartphone app had become stable and (apart from the frequent disconnects / lost sessions) quite usable. In particular it now has a copy and paste function which makes it possible to recover from those annoying "You don't have permission to post in this forum" messages (a.k.a. the server lost your login credentials, again).However in the past few weeks I have seen huge problems with the app. It is locking up / freezing several times a day. A good proportion of the time it locks up my entire phone. When I go to the task manager to kill the app, Android is recommending termination of the app. The app is using a very high level of CPU, even when it is doing nothing at all. It is also uses a lot of memory and the amount of memory it is using increases from 28MB at startup to around 100MB or more. (I dare say the entire DCUK forum could fit comfortably into 100MB). So it looks like it has CPU leaks and memory leaks - at least on my Android smartphone.I know there was a recent update to the app. I suspect Tapitalk (who make the app - DCUK just use it) have introduced some serious bugs into the latest release. Is anyone else experiencing increased problems recently?
