"Clear chest" My asthma is always a bit of b**ch to control but the last month and a half it has been a night mare. 2 hospital admissions and frequent drs trips. I have to take my ventolin through a spacer constantly now. I can't even put a number on how often I take it because it is just all the time. I sound constantly like I'm out of breath and just walking is exhausting. I haven't got an chest infection and my chest sounds clear. My sats are up and down but don't seem to correlate with my breathing. My peak flow is usually 350ish it's not got past 200 in the last month or so. I'm just at a loss, because my chest is clear other than giving me the spacer and just keeping me on preds and increasing my symbicort to the max the Drs don't seem to be able to do anything else. But I'm not improving. It's just so frustrating my chest muscles keep spasming (or that's what the Drs said) because they are working so hard and i ache all over. I feel so tired I would do anything to feel better. Anyway this has turned into a moan sorry has anyone else been here? Is there anything you can recommend? I know my gp and the consultant at the hospital are trying but there must be something else that can be done?? It's like because my chest is clear they don't really know what to say. My life is on hold my children are missing their mum being normal and I teach at seniors school so coming upto GCSE exams season i need to be in work!! I take montuklast and omeprzole as well. I sometimes feel like I'm going crazy because I should be able to just breathe!! Tia CXPs sorry this sounds a bit whingy
