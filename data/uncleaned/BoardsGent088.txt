Clearing up the appearance of scars caused by acneHey guys. I'm a 24 yr old guy and for most of my teens and my adult life I have had ance. Never overly bad but I've always had a few spots on my face. I seem to have finally gotten rid them after using Loreal Men Expert Black Charcoal wash for the past few months.ÊThing is I'm now left with a lot of scars - mainly on my chin, cheeks and nose. What could I realistically get in a pharmacy today that will help reduce their appearance (not looking for makeup or concealer). I'm hoping for something that will remove scars completely or at least reduce their appearance.ÊLaser treatment would be ideal but for the time being its out of my price range.
