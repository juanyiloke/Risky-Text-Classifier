Abruptly Diagnosed.by username1337 » Mon Mar 02, 2015 10:32 amI was diagnosed with schizophrenia 2 years ago shortly after a substance induced psychosis, I was thus Prescribed Clonazepam and anti-psychotics from my psychiatrist though decided to quit shortly into anti-psychotics due to the side effects (I attempted a few). I took a moderate dose of Clonazepam for a year, then I decided to ween off the Clonazepam gradually as an attempt to reduce medication and experienced increased psychotic/schizophrenia symptoms about a month in after discontinuation.Once returning to Clonazepam my schizophrenia symptoms are at an all time low? I am starting to get things done around the house; my work is improving! Is it possible I've been in psychosis due to benzodiazepines this entire time? or possibly I was suffering from psychosis induced by general anxiety and depression?
