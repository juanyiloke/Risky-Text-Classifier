  FALL Allergies/Asthma are bad 2013 & 2014________________________________________Hello. I've been having a very difficult time last Fall (2013) and now this Fall with asthma from the seasonal allergies. I'm on my usual medications, along with a lot of others to keep my airways open. Being weaned offsteroids again (3 times in l.5 months). I'm hoping for an early frost to kill off the ragweed and whatever else is out there. I sure could use some support regarding this matter. It's really affecting my day to day life. Next year I hope to be prepared by having had updating allergy testing and a new plan of action. Can anyonen relate to the thick mucous in the throat and upper airways? IV steroids help in the ER, but naturally it wears off, and I'm back on oral steroids, I get tapered off by my physician..only to have it start up again. Thanks for reading!
