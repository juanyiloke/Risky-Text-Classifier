Asthma by physio! The other night i was having a moan about asthma, today i'm having a laugh about it. Last night i went to running club but only did about 2 miles, though slightly faster than i have been doing of late so my lungs were slightly twitchy today, definitely wouldn't say it was any worse than that. Went swimming and did 80 lengths - without taking reliever beforehand and felt absolutely fine. I went to my physio appointment cos i've got an injured foot (5th metatarsalgia apparently!) but she's also treating my back / ankles / calf muscles. The treatment today was very painful and i could feel myself getting tense / holding my breath against the pain etc Once she'd finished and i'd relaxed the cough started! I was hoping i could last until i was out before taking the inhaler (i wasn't exactly embarrassed at it actually being asthma but more, i think i felt silly for it being triggered by a physio session!). Anyway, when i went out to pay and book the next session both the physio and the girl on the desk were concerned about me asking did i want a glass of water or a cough sweet so decided to settle everyone's nerves (and my lungs) and take the inhaler. Silly lungs again, ah well!
