Completely fed up¥	Hi everyone¥	I am 4 months post mastectomy with LD flap reconstruction. I have had 4 of my 6 cycles of chemo and got off really lightly til this time. To my surprise it appears that me suffering isnt agreeable in the household, my 5 year old Grand daughter tells me I am no fun since I got ill and her behaviour appears to be deteriorating since I started chemo, She lives with us,¥	Who am I supposed to please and is there any point carrying on with my final 2 sessiona as I am undoubtedly going to be sofa bound and things will deteriorate further. I feel very resentful I am not allowed to get over my treatment due to having to care for her - for Gods sake I didnt choose to be ill! I dread her coming in from school cos being bothered is such an effort - I even said I may go and stay somewhere else for my next treatment just to get away.¥	Why is it so hard :-(
