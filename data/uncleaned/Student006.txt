  Dropping out helpby chocolate buttonsHiI'm currently doing a Foundation course at university and I have been unhappy from the start. The course is not what I expected, the lecturers are not very good and the uni has a bad atmosphere. I only applied there because I couldn't afford to go to the uni that I originally got into, so I panicked and just applied to that one through Clearing as a last resort. I have not made a lot of effort with work because of this and I have recieved bad grades or fails. I am very depressed, stressed and anxious. I have not attended any exams. The last time I went in was 2 weeks ago, I had a presentation. I only went in because I didn't want to let my presentation partner down.The only reason I hadn't dropped out before is because I don't want to sit at home doing nothing all day. Work is hard to find in my area.I am thinking about re-applying for a different subject, degree(BSc)and uni for this September, would this be possible, considering that I have technically failed this year already?I am nearly 21 now and I am worried about my future... (I didn't go to university when I was 18 because I decided to do an apprenticeship instead). TL;DR - Can I apply to a different university for September despite failing this year? What about Student Finance?Thank you.
