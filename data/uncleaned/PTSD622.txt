I finally sought help when everything came to a head last year (2005). It was the best thing I could have done.The condition is VERY dibilitating and ruins every aspect of one's life.The unfortunate thing is that there is virtually no help available within the 'standard' mental health services. I had to seek out my own help through ASSIST, a specialist charity.The main problem is that any kind of recovery takes a long time, and one needs continual support - which is not generally available. Although I have come a long way, there are still many effects of the condition that I find very difficult to cope with. I really don't know what to do now. I have to try and cope with the condition almost by myself.As a result of my experience with PTSD I made a website whith the aim of providing a place where people with the condition can help each other. It is not concerned with the causes of the condition, or any kind of diagnosis. It is just a place where we can help each other. Teke a look
