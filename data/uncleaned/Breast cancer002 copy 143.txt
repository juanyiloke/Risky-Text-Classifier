Early stages of diagnosis feeling scared need some reasurrance please¥	Hi everyone, I am new to this site and have been feeling a little scared about the next few weeks. I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobulor breast cancer. Up to 5cm with no apparent lumpth node involvement but I am booked in for a mastectomy next week and a biospsy of some nodes that they will take out precautionary. With results 2 weeks later. They are not outruling any node involvement which is so scary .. everytime I have been for an appt the tumour size changed and then they biospyed two nodules attached to the tumour which had cancer cells.. the mri showed no other tumours. I am a very strong positive person and I know I will feel so much happier when I get the full diagnosis. But until then I have been having moments of panic and worry. I understand it's a process that everyone goes through and it takes time but it's so scary when you don't know what the future holds.. Any small pain in your body makes me think it's already travelled... I know tomorrow I will wake up in a better place but today is a tough day.
