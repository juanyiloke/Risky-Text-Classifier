Metformin and side effectsI haven't posted on here for a while but would like some opinions/advice. I am due to have an ultrasound scan and endoscopy soon. The scan is to check for possible gallstones and the endoscopy is for my gastric reflux which I have suffered from for many years. I am not sure whether this is coincidental or not but if I put my finger on it, I have noticed that since I have been taking Metformin (I am on x1 500mg daily) which I started in January this year, I have not felt well at all. It started off with my appetite being surpressed which I didn't mind too much as I am trying to lose weight but now I am getting abdominal pain (hence the appointment for a scan and possible gallbladder problem or gallstones). I just don't know if these symptoms are related in any way to something not right with my digestive system or the fact that they are side effects of Metformin. I suppose I will know soon enough once I have the tests but I have heard that Metformin can cause a lot of upset for some people, does anyone else relate to this at all? thanks
