I am a writer working with the lung association; we are fighting to keep pollution out of the air that we breathe. We know air pollution causes lung diseases like asthma and COPD - and we know poor air quality also makes asthma and COPD far worse. We are looking for folks in PENNSYLVANIA with asthma and/or COPD to tell us their story, and support our fight for healthy air. Please let me know if anyone is interested in having us write their story? We will use it for the lung association website and local media. The more folks understand the link between asthma and healthy air - the more we can do to PREVENT lung disease. Thank you for caring.
