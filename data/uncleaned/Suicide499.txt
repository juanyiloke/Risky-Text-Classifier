a little bit about meAdrientarted getting severe anxiety when I was 14. At the time I didn’t know what it was because I had never experienced a feeling anything like this. My problem was I didn’t tell anyone. Society puts a heavy weight on the shoulders of men. That we cannot break, that we must strong. I remember sitting on my room in complete silence waiting for this feeling to go away. Most nights it did not. I started to become very depressed and by 15 I was in 24/7 care because my parents didn’t think I was safe. So that is how it started for me, now I’m 18 and still struggle with depression. Suicide has always seemed like an answer to me. It does seem like an end to my pain but I have family. Out of my family I think how my brothers,sister, and parents would feel when they found out I’ve taken my own life. I would give my life for theirs like any of you would. I know I need my life though, I couldn’t put them through hell. Now I don’t know why I’m even posting this, you people don’t know me. But this morning suicide seemed like the only way when I stumbled across this website. I started reading some of the posts and it let happiness just peek its head through the hard outter shell that is my depression and I feel a little better. So thank you to the people on this site.
