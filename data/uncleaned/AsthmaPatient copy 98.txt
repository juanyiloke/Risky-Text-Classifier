Asthma Flare upPosted 3 months agoHiNeeding advice, taken my last dose of steroids this morning, also had my doxycycline tablets too got 2 more days of those and had my preventer inhaler as well which is symbicort x2 inhales as i am getting over a cold and felt i needed the extra help. Asthma nurse also agreed this as well.My current symptoms are a very tight chest, like a band is being tightened around me, a cough from the cold that is more annoying but not producing any phlegm.It feels horrible but i am not getting any worse than friday i just dont think that nothing i am doing is easing it.I always struggle this time of the year as well with my Asthma, particularly going from a warm environment into the cold and vice versa. I wrap a scarf around my mouth etc when going outside.Any advice please?I do have another appointment with my Asthma nurse on Monday 16th Nov
