Body image issuesI know some might consider this a trivial matter but I feel cellulite is having a very negative impact on my body image. My cellulite is very very bad. It goes from my bum nearly down to the back of my knees and believe me when I say there are more dimples then I care to admit to. Under harsh lighting it looks absolutely terrible.ÊI never wear skirts yet I am in my mid twenties. I know some will say they wear skirts without giving a dam but I have never seen anybody with cellulite as visible as mine.ÊI know I could do with losing weight around my hips and thighs. However I am within the correct BMI for my weight/height. I have other issues such as varicose veins and thread veins. Ultimately I feel that these issues impact on intimate relationships. I know I may look alright in clothes but I feel if any man were to see whats under my clothes he wouldn't find me attractive.ÊDoes anybody have any tips on how to deal with these issues? Or does anybody find themselves in the same boat. I would love to hear some people's opinions.
