Black FridayDid anyone venture to the shops? I would not go to the REAL shops at this time for all the tea in China (as my gran used to say).I saw that some of the big UK stores held Black Friday sales. Not quite as bad as the USA but one woman had her arm broken and was trampled on. A man was arrested for assulting security staff who would not let him buy more than one TV.In the USA 7 people have been killed in Black Friday sales. One was shot over a row in a parking space.Some of the U-tube videos of the USA are really frightening.
