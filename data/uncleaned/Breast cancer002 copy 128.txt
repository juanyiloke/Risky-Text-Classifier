Just been told I have lung mets :(¥	Hi all¥	I've just had a meeting with my onc. I finished treatment for breast cancer a year ago. I had a lumpectomy, cemo and rads. I found more lumps in the same breast some weeks ago. I've had various scans and now just been told that it has spread to my lungs. I start more chemo, taxol and Avastin on April 10th. I'm so shocked. The onc said the average that people live after this diagnosis is 2 years. I have daughters aged 16 and 17. I'm a single mum. I just can't believe it. It all feels so surreal - like I'm standing back and watching it happening to someone else. I don't know what to do, which way to turn,how to prepare my girls..........just so devastated..............
