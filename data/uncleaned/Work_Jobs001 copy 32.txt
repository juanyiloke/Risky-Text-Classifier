Unreliable Reference________________________________________Hi guys,Hope someone can offer advice as I am going grey with stress here. I'm finding it extremely difficult to find work at the moment so I'm suffering with major anxiety over this. I applied for a secure position last year that takes a long time to process. It's coming to final stages for me now; I passed the interviews and tests so now all that's left is checking references (which is still maybe a few weeks away).The thing is, I'm no longer certain about the reliability of one person I used as a reference. The others will give glowing reviews of me, they have confirmed as much. But there is no guarantee as to which people my potential new employers will call from the short list I gave them. Would it seem odd if I called my potential new employers and asked to remove one of my references from the list? Or should I let this years worth of processing hang in the balance on a gamble that this person wont be called/will do right by me in the end?The idea that I would get this job has been all that has been keeping me and my family sane throughout this process. My whole life has been on hold and I've been on anxiety medication due to the stress of trying to make ends meet. I really want to ensure that I get this because I don't know where to go if I don't.Thank you for any advice you have to offer.
