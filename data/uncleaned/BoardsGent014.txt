Good form, bad form & everything in between?I'm not sure if it's been done on this forum, but these threads seem popular enough and a good way to encourage a sense of community within the walls of our fine gentlemen's club Generally speaking, we as men aren't great talking about "feelings" or anything that gets more complicated than happy, sad or p¡ssed off but this could work. So maybe give it a shot?I will kick it off by saying I'm in good form, first 2 days of my new undergrad went without a hitch. Seems like a nice bunch in my class and looking forward to the new challenges that I'll face. Also have 2 businessy meetings during the week, bit nervous about one somewhat but again bit of preparation and should go fine.
