  A good day!!________________________________________OMG. I can't believe that today was great. Today, I just went to a freshman orientation for my college. It was the best thing I ever had in the past depressed life. In the beginning, it was all awkward but, the leaders were making us dance, play game, talk about fears about college, fears of making friends, and many other things! I had good time actually being with people. I was even thinking of starting a new life as I enter into college life. It might even help me with coping the depression.In the past months (before today), my future was very dark. I could not see any farther after graduating. I had no goal or no dream. I hoped that after graduation, my life will be over. I actually thought of killing myself after graduation. But, the freshman orientation changed my mind so much. While I was in the orientation, I thought "maybe it's worth to live for longer". I actually wanted to come back to the place. It was much better than my life in my house and my church.I thought that maybe going to college was a good choice I made of. Maybe this college might help me with my depression. Because they offered so much activities that you can be around. They even offered me a freshman trip for 25 bucks for 1 nights 2 days! All of the activities offered by both school and the recreation center were mostly free. They will be having welcome week during the beginning for the freshman. They also have program where they groups students and try to put them in at least two same classes. And I was like "I can't wait to try out all these new stuff". My future seems to be getting brighter now. I know some of you out there still have bad days but, today was like the best day I ever had since the depression hit me. Man, it's really good to go new places and meet new people. It's like starting a new life!
