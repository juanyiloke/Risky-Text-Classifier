student finance mallarkyby TheDoubleTapSo, I've had my share of problems with student finance. They held back my money so long that by the time I actually got it from them I was heavily into my overdraft. My student finance payments now just cover my overdraft, so as soon as I get paid I instantly chip away at my overdraft again, pure frustration.But that's besides the point. My problem is that I get a low, low amount for my student finance because I live with my parents. Presumably the student finance people assume my parents pay my bills, buy my shopping, etc. Unfortunately, 'tis not so. I pay rent, I buy my own shopping, I pay for supplies for uni, blah blah blah and as I reach the end of my first year I'm beginning to see that this uni life is really not at all feasable with what they give me. I was wondering if there is some way for me to resolve this issue when I reapply for next year's finance, some way to make them understand I still have bills and a living to pay for despite the fact I live with my parents for convenience?
