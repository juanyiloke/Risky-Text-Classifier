Anxious about everything after recovering from depression.I am desperate in need of some help here. My parents passed away in an accident about a year back. I was depressed for several weeks and somehow recovered from that depression, but then started getting anxious about everything. I started to get anxious about getting sick, getting failed for exams, getting a job after studies, friends and families' health, dogs getting hurt, and about almost everything I can think about. I am getting a feeling that this is getting out of control. I wanted to get some kind of treatment. I searched about treatments for anxiety and read anxiety treatment center reviews on sites like californiarehabclinicreviews.com to find a good treatment center. But then again, I started getting anxious about how that will affect my future and if treatment doesn't work and that sort of things. I may need some advice, even though I don’t know if it will help a lot.
