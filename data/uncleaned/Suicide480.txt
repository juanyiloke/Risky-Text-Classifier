dont know what to doheartinaboxEveryone around me is so selfish. I can’t even talk about my feelings. My own family can’t even stand to be around me. They are constantly trying to get away from me. They always tell me how annoying I am and that I should just die. I don’t have any true friends. I’m kinda just here. I’m already not gonna graduate high school. That seems to be the only thing anyone cares about. Nobody actually cares how I’m doing. I’ve been depressed for years now. I’m only 17. I shouldn’t be going through all this.
