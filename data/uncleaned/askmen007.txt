Work from home opportunity...2014-08-26, 02:38 PMI've been looking for a part-time, additional income opportunity and have been considering a multitude of businesses that can be successfully operated from the comfort of my home.After talking with friends and learning how some of them produce additional income for themselves, I think I've stumbled onto a niche market where riches could be mine with little to no effort.Used panties.I know several women who make a decent living selling old, stained underwear online. Who would have ever guessed there would be a market for used underwear but apparently, business is booming.After careful checking I realized THERE ARE NO MEN offering this service..... seriously?What could be better than profiting from old, soiled, ragged underwear? I have dozens of such items in my closet, on my bedroom floor, a few pair in the living room and even one pair that has hung outside for a few weeks in the rain and sun. I imagine that one will sell for a pretty penny.Anyway.... what I need to know is how many women would buy a pair of sexy men's underwear if it were offered?For any guys hoping to cash in on my idea, you can pm me for franchise info....ÊMoss' Underwears... soiled and stained like you like.ÊC'mon, ladies... am I on to something or what?NO orders at this time, sorry.
