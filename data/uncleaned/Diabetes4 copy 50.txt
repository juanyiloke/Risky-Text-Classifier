Diabetes and mental healthThis is the one area of care that I feel most people with Diabetes are let down by the system.It involves being referred and joining the general psychiatric waiting lists and all specialties tend to have long waiting lists.In actual fact most people really want a voice for their concerns over their illness that can't be covered in a 15 minute appointment with either an endo , a dsn , or a GP. anyone with a long term chronic illness is bound to have times where they need a bit of medicine for the mind to re invigorate themselves...does anyone else share this sort of view ??
