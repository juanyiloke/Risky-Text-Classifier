So for about 2-3 weeks now, I have this level of fatigue that's wretched. I have also been having a lot of variation on my peak flows. Mostly I am waking in the yellow, take the meds and then tip into green. a day or two ago, woke up in the red and did meds and tipped into green really quickly....I went from 300 to 450 very quickly. I am just fatigued though beyond belief. Today I was in the bathroom and just had to sit down and rest my head on the counter, and wound up almost falling asleep. Dr attributes to allergies (I have no other symptoms and haven't for years) and I just sent him my PEF chart, and he's concerned about the diurnal swing.... But the fatigue, Holy Rip Van Winkle, Batman! And I have had tons of health issues in the last two years so I can't take any sick time as I am out of sick time, twice over.
