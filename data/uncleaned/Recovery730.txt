RecoveringI have been suffering depression and anxiety for about 5 years. 3 years ago, I couldn't take it anymore, I was sick of the nasty depressing thoughts that came over me, so I went to see a doctor. I had seen doctors and therapists in the past, but I felt like they made me worse so I didn't want to do anything or see anyone about it.My doctor last year was really really understanding, and listened to what I had to say. She put me on anti depressants. I have been taking those for 3 years now. Last year, I decided I didn't need them, and stopped taking them. which only threw me to the bottom. I suffered even worse, so quickly started taking them again. I still didn't feel like I was getting anywhere with recovery.I instead, looked into a more natural and healthy way of recovering. I STARTED TO EXERCISE & EAT HEALTHY!! I have never looked back since. I am still on medication, but I have never felt that sadness since then. I exercise daily, and it has improved my state of mind drastically. I cannot explain the difference it has made.I truly believe that exercising and eating right can help you mend your heart and mind, and try overcome whatever is dragging you down. I hope my story could help a little bit.remember, you are not the only one feeling like this.
