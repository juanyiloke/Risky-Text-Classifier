Hi I'm 1r and I'm hearing voices right now. I keep telling myself that they are not real and they keep trying to convince me that they are. When I first starting hearing them it was a man. Then it was a women.and it is like the middle of the night and my dad is asleep and my mom is at work I don't know what to do, and I'm starting to feel like a freak, but I am going to tell my mom in the morning. But they won't go away even though I tell them to....what should I do?
