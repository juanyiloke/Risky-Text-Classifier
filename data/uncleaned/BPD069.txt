How do I know if I should be on medication? *TW*by smurple » Sun May 31, 2015 6:22 amI'll try to make this concise. -diagnosed with depression at 15-attempted suicide at 16, diagnosed with Bipolar-tried a dozen medications over the years -attempted suicide at 18, 20, and 22, diagnosed with BPD-gone to a dozen different psychiatrists and therapists over the years, trying various medicationsAfter being diagnosed with BPD, my most recent doctor told me that I didn't need medication, just therapy. I went to therapy for about 4 months and ran out of things to talk about and stopped going. I'm still suicidal about half the time. If I went to therapy I don't even know what I would talk about. I just want to die. I don't feel good. I don't know why. Doesn't that mean I should be on medication?I feel like my doctor doesn't like me because I've left and gone back so many times. How do I know if I should be on medication or just go to therapy or what? It's so confusing.Please help.Thank you.
