Ups and downsLast night, I was invited to a camera club exhibition. Events like that usually have some kind of buffet or supper afterwards. I expected that a load of biscuits, cakes and sweet stuff would be served. This didn't happen as I had a few slices of fresh roasted ham, cocktail sausages and would you believe, boiled rice. I also had tuna sandwiches (white bread...naughty!) It was a good evening in that Diabetic-friendly food was served. Oh yes, I had a glass of skimmed milk with my metformin.First thing this morning, my BG test was 5.2  I felt really great to get such a good reading. Then after my usual breakfast some new furniture arrived and of course, I spent time putting it together. At the end of all that my BG test was 4.8. It seems now that some types of work will result in my BG levels being bumped down drastically. I'm just worried that I won't be much use to an employer if this is going to happen regularly.Sometimes, when I'm out I can go into a panic thinking, "How long have I got before I suffer a hypo?" Then I usually check my BG level immediately. It always turns out to be a false alarm.
