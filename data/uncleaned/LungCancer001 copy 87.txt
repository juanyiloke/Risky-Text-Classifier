12mm nodule in right lung - AdenocarcinomaHi,I sure hope somebody could give me some information.I had my kidney out on Sept. 6, due to kidney cancer. The doctor found a 12 mm nodule in my right lung which was an Adenocarcinoma. I never smoked. My late husband was a heavy smoker.Anyhow, I went back into the hospital on Oct. 29 and had an open thoracotomy and had the nodule removed, which everyone assumed was going to be kidney cancer cells. The pathology report came back as a primary lung cancer.I am now supposed to go back in for a lobectomy of my right lower lobe of my lung. 1) Does anybody know - after having an adenocarcinoma removed from a lung how lung should one wait until having the lobectomy?2) Should I wait a bit until the lobectomy? The thoracotomy was a complete bitch and I still do not have much strength in my right arm and shoulder?3) Can you wait ? ARe these aggressive cancers?4) It's tough getting information from the doctor's office. They were supposed to call me Tues - I called them and was instructed they would call on Friday, which they never did - so I called them again, and the receptionist said she'd "try" to get ahold of the doctor (he's a thoracic surgeon - busy man), is this normal?I can't get my questions answered for one thing. Has this been your experience?Thank you for any support
