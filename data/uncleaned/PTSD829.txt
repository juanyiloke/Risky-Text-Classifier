 Life's A Bitch: Then ....! Okay, peeps. I'm Up, at the moment. Cruising nicely.I'm also down to about page 12 of the 17 here. I'll try not to dig up too many zombie threads as I go. Honest Just that; This is me. The Real me. Happy little soul without a care in the world. Leave me alone and I'm just bouncing along ~ most of the time.Reading so many pages of So many posts though, over the last few days and nights? Christ! Such hand wringing and wretchedness!Don't get me wrong! I'm one of ye, remember. I know the score, all too well. But: Must we, by Forum Rule, Only post when our heads are exploding ....? Here's a little anecdote then. Absolutely True! I sometimes look back on, and cling to this one. It helps anchor me .....First, reader, please stop and imagine a sound. A plane, a jet, what ever. But, it's that "VeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! " sound they make, on the films, when they've been shot down and and screaming towards earth. Okay? Hold that thought for in a minute.So; I got mine, I dunno, fifteen? Twenty five years ago? What ever. I was Very lucky, in that my beautiful GP had specialised in head health. She took one look at me and ~ keeping her back to the wall, next to the door ~ stated unequivocally that;" Oh yeah. That's PTSD alright! " She knew her shit!So, I entered the chain. Was sent to the local Barkers place. Had some guy asking me questions and ticking boxes on his form.Sent home. Climbed the walls. Bit the walls. Week later, I'm back at Barkers. Eyeing the guy opposite me. Wondering how f**ked He is. Will he randomly launch himself at me? What if I bite Him? My name's called.Sat in front of, I dunno. They're asking me questions. I'm off, some place else. But, a remnant of my consciousness is trotting out the answers. What ever.Go home. Drop by at some random building, to beg water to take my med's with. Pass out on a bit of grass, somewhere ~ damn med's! Wake up. Get up. Stagger on towards home.Had a few sessions of that shit. Then, I'm asked back there again .....Enter Doctor D!Older bloke. More sixty than these thirty / forty year old looking people I'd been seeing. But, what a man! He absolutelyExuded 'F**k It!' This guy couldn't give a shit! He was just " F**k 'em all! " incarnate!" Hullo, Chris! Sup with you, mate? Post Traumatic? No worries! We'll have ye right as rain in no time! " And the clouds Did part! And the sun shone down on me. And I was given an appointment for a weeks time. And Iskipped home! F**k the med's! F**k the grassy patch! F**k PTSD!!!Dr D was such a positive force in my life. I felt totally confident that He would sort me out! Week later and I'm heading back to the clinic. I'm like;  " Dr D will sort out meee! "Then, I find my self faced with this dour faced c**t of a middle aged woman. Her name is for ever etched on my mind, In acid. But, I won't mention it, obviously. C**t.And, when ~ in my confusion and pain ~ I stuttered out my enquiry after 'Dr D' ? She flatly told me:" I'm afraid Dr D dropped dead, last week. "VeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
