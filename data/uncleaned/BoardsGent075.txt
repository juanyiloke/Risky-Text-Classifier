A discussion on the the taking and distribution of private images of oneselfFolks,There is a somewhat similar thread already over on TLL, but it focuses more on how such images should be handled once a relationship ends. I would like to take a step back from that, and focus more on the initial creation and consequent distribution of such images of oneself. I have spent a sizeable chunk of my life working in the R&D side of electronic technology, and am naturally interested in how we then put this technology to use in our everyday lives. Although I find the the vast majority of uses positive and progressive, there is one particular trend which I simply cannot get my mind around, and that is the creation and distribution of private images of oneself. Please don't get me wrong, I am in no way prudish etc, and have no problems per se with the creation and distribution of such material provided that one can guarantee that it remains private (that is, if one so wishes in the first place). This clearly cannot be the case though in the vast majority of instances, and once the image is distributed then you have effectively signed over the right to have it on the internet, forever. Any arguments along the lines of 'oh I thought the person that I sent them too would keep them private' etc are incredibly naive in my opinion. I fully agree that intentionally passing such material on to others is a very nasty thing to do, but I certainly still believe strongly that the core issue in play here is the initial creation and distribution.This is a very powerful technology and everyone needs to use it responsibly and take responsibility for their own actions. Opinions?
