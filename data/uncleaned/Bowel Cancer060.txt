Distracting yourself.HiIt must be obvious that I am an internet junkie and found the internet and various forums a great help to pass the time during all the treatments, and I guess offering help /advice to others makes me feel "useful" in some small way, and occupies my mind.This made me think of this thread idea ..What did you/do you do to distract yourself during your chemo / post-op times when you are a bit too weak for your normal stuff?Apart from the internet ... I tried to walk a little bit as much as I could, always trying to find pretty places / gardens which filled my senses with beauty. we re-joined the Nationsl Trust cos there are a few properties near us that we could go to and mooch a little in the grounds. I found that very helpful.I took more photos and used photoshop to play with the images, which is a creative, pleasing thing that requires little of my body.I also took up tapestry again ... I reckon that needle-crafts take up just the right amount of concentration to keep my mind busy, without taxing me very hard, and with little strain on my body (though I couldn't always do it during the oxyliplatin chemo when fingers were too sore) ... It is also creative, handling pretty colours and making something new, which is a good feeling.I did an elephant tapestry during my first year of radiation/srugery/chemo and a floral one in the seocnd round. I have one in reserve, now that someone bought me as a gift, but sort of hope I will never even start it, as, doing tapestry signifies a particular need to me! LOL
