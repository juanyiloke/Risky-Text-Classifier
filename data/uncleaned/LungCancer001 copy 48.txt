new to site and to cancerHello everyone. I have just found this site and am hoping that I can find the courage to cope with lung cancer as you all seem to be doing. At the moment I am stressing out so badly I am starting to scare everyone around me. In March 2013 I was told I had lung cancer and seemed to go through an enormous amount of tests. I had a chest xray a ct scan a pet scan and a bronchoscopy. After all these tests I was told surgery was my best option as I has cancer in upper right lung and in 1 chest lymph node. 1 week later I was informed the team had jumped the gun and I would need another bronchoscopy as the last one was inconclusive. After a second bronchoscopy the result was still inconclusive but the surgeon thought it best to remove the top and middle lobes of right lung and any lymph nodes with cancer with a view to chemo getting rid of any residue. The surgery has been done but unfortunately the lymph nodes with cancer have turned out to be cancer growing on the main artery to my heart and couldn't be removed by surgery. Fair enough I thought and presumed chemo and radiotherapy would be the next step. Now though I have been told I need another bronchoscopy! Why do i need another? My lung nurse doesn't have the answer and its another 5 weeks before I see a doctor. Can anyone shed any light on this. It really wold help. Thanks
