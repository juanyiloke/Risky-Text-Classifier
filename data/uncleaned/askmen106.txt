Career v.s. Personal Growth. How do you decide which is more important?2012-08-05, 11:22 PMHave you ever felt like your stuck in a rut personally, despite finding some success in your career?Long story short, here's a little background info:A few years ago I moved to a small (-ish) town to start a small business. I chose to do this so that I would not have a lot of competition, and to put myself in the best position I could to succeed.Fast forward a little more than 3 years, business is going well. The company is growing slowly but surely each year. And, given the financial stress I was used to having in the past, things are much better.---That said, I feel like I am in a rut personally. Having positioned myself as an expert in the area I did, I find it difficult to continue to grow / learn.... i.e. get better at my trade.I love big cities. I've begun traveling to one nearby (6hr commute each way), so that I can become a student again and learn.ÊI love learning! It's invigorating!---Here's the problem, short-term this is working out great!But, I don't know if I can keep up with this kind of schedule for years to come. Being self-employed, uprooting myself and starting over from scratch again might not be the best choice as I am in my early 30's.ÊIt's doable for sure but it'd most likely be a 3-5yr struggle. Who knows, maybe in a few years, I can hire a few employees to give myself more freedom.I'm interested in hearing the stories of others that have experienced this. How did you overcome it? What changes did you make?Looking forward to hearing your stories!-Maipenrai
