  ImprovementI've been waiting months to post in this forum. I think I am finally getting better. My pdoc raised my dosage of prozac to 30 mg and after three weeks, I started tofeel better  on some days. It's been almost 4 weeks now and I've noticed a definate improvement in my mood. Usually, I am VERY reactive. If someone forgets, my birthday, I would feel REALLY awful and have extremely scary and negative thoughts. When people poke fun at me, I literally break down and cry. The other day, my teacher was yelling at me (in a joking, lighthearted way) and I didn't feel extremely hurt and I didn't cry. I was SO surprised. Also, one of my friends forgot my birthday and I was totally okay with it because I know it happens. I forget birthdays too. It's not a big deal. I guess there are moments and days when I am still sad and unmotivated but it takes 6 weeks for prozac to fully work so I'm expecting more improvement. :)
