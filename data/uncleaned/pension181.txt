Coach toursI love them!  Every year, and sometimes twice a year if I'm lucky, I take a coach tour to Germany.  I live in Leeds and the coach picks us up in the city centre somewhere around 1 am (I know, tell me about it!!) travels to Folkestone, through the Eurotunnel, across Belgium and into the Mosel Valley.  The journey takes around 17 hours, and folk often say they couldn't make such a long trip.  I just regard it as the first day of my holiday as I love travelling.  And it's a huge bonus if I get a seat at  the front of the coach!We go to a tiny village on  the banks of the Mosel river, and the hotel is just a few minutes walk away.  It is a wonderful, friendly place, and the staff are brilliant.  Each day we go for excursions to various cities such as Trier, Koblenz, Cologne, etc, and we also have a cruise up the Rhine, stopping at the wine town of Rudesheim.  A wonderful trip.This year, however, I am having a change and going to Ireland.  My great-great- grandparents came from County Clare in the mid 1800s, and this coach trip goes there! Back to my roots.....It's not until October, however, and I get so darned impatient!     but at least it will give me time to save a few more quid, if Gordon Brown leaves me any! But I am grateful I don't drink or smoke.  Lord knows how folk can afford it.....
