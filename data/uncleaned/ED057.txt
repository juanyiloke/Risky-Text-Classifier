Do I have an eating disorder?Do I have an eating disorder? I honestly don't know. I wish I didn't, but I think I do. It has been 4 years. 4 years of feeling negatively about my body. I don't have a huge problem with eating. I don't starve myself at all. But after I eat, I purge. It hasn't been like this for 4 straight years though. I go through spurts. I had been doing really good for a long time but this week I lost it. Since then I have been doing it more and thinking about purging more and more. I hate the way I feel after I eat, but the way I feel after purging isn't any better. Nobody knows I feel this way about myself. I am terrified to admit to anyone that I am struggling with this. I am heavily involved in my church and I feel like so many people place me on a pedestal and think I am a "perfect christian." There is NO way I could tell my parents, they would never understand. I am a psychology student so I know a lot about eating disorders, and I really don't think I have one. So I really don't know what to do. I think the reason I am writing this is to share my story. It has been so painful, lonely, and impossible to keep this from everyone I know.
