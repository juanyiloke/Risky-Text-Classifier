Taking a year off?by JaynesorenI'm supposed to be starting university in Coventry this september, but I have recently been thinking it may be a good idea to take a gap year. Id want to use this year for saving up money for university, because since im moving so far i feel like it would be sensible to have a big safety net of money considering I wouldnt be able to ask back home for help with money.Since im doing Art (graphics & Illustration) i feel like the worry of losing my skills in the year out isnt there, because I know itd continue working on things in my personal time. My worry is that Ill be 20 starting university, and 23/4 leaving. Is the age gap going to feel like a bad thing when i begin university? and does anyone who has taken a year to work before university got any advice for how it has or has not helped them once starting university?basically is it a good idea?
