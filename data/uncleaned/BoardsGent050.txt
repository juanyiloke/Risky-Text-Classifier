Do you know how to hold a knife and fork?Is this an Irish thing? I notice this every time I go out for dinner with friends or colleagues that they cannot hold a knife and fork. People holding their knife and fork in the most unusual ways, and it's not gender specific. One girl I know holds her knife and forks like a dagger, I tried to replicate it when I was at home and it was so awkward.ÊIs it not basic social skills, were lads on here not shown how to use a knife and fork when they were children?
