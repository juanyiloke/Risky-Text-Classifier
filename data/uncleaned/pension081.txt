Slowing AgingRather than wasting time and money trying to find disease cures, we should be working to slow the ageing process and thus delay ill health.If we invest more in slowing the ageing process, modest gains in knowledge will slow the aging rate to such a pace, an additional five percent more adults over 65 will be healthier as opposed to disabled,every year from 2030 to 2060; this amounts to 11.7 million more healthy adults over 65 in 2060, 1.25 percent reduction in the likelihood of age-related diseases.ÊAll this if we just increase life expectancy by 2.2 years, compared to one year if we make advances in disease research.
