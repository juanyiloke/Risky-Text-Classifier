Releasing bottled up feelingsStarted by tommy?, 20-02-14 06:54 AMHi,Last night after nearly a year of feeling depressed I have realised the cause which has been under my nose all a long, and that is the stress, frustration, anger and negativity to my old boss, I only left a week ago and have a new job which i start soon.I feel a little relieved now I know the cause for this position I'm in, however I still have all these feeling bottled up, I know they are there and need to somehow let go and move on, but I'm not sure how, in my world I would like to just go and shout at him and give him some home truths but I know that isn't me or the answer.Anyone have any suggestions?
