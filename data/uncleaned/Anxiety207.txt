Anxiety & MarriageI feel like I put my husband is this horrible position... You can't "win" with anxiety. It isn't logical. It doesn't let a person be calm and process things "normally."When my husband and I fight, it always goes through stages. It starts out with something, either big or small, usually the latter. I start to panic, he wants to retreat to avoid my outburst, which causes me to panic more. He gets angry. I get angry. Then I have this realization that I am not being logical. I REALIZE that my brain is messing with me, and it's just this huge feeling of guilt that comes over me. I instantly feel bad for blowing up on him(if he didn't do anything wrong especially..) & I end up hating myself and my anxiety.My husband has actually been a really understanding man about this. He DOES get that I cannot control it, and in some instance, he keeps a cool head and talks me down. But you can only push a person so far until they start to push back, you know? I can't blame him for getting frustrated, just like he doesn't blame me for my anxiety.I am always trying to "do better", and on my good days I do everything I can to be a good wife. I am terrified of failing my marriage because I cannot stop freaking out over things that shouldn't be such a big deal. (We are talking like... didn't stop at the store for dog food, spent too much time on his phone while watching a movie, etc.. nothing major..)How are you guys handling anxiety and your marriage?
