Then I was given a machine called a &quot;nippy&quot; I use it at night it helps my lungs, now I have cut the amount of medication i take down by half and have actually had a holiday in kenya and I am going back again this year, so I say to anyone who has asthama &quot;there is life after asthama&quot; you just need wonderful medical staff and a loving husband
