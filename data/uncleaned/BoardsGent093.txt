Hair Transplant SurgeonsHi Everyone,I am thinking about going for a hair transplant, as my hair has thinned significantly. For the first few years, I was dealing with it ok. However, for the past year my hairloss has really got to me. My hairloss seems to have stopped over the past 2 years, I am currently a 4 on the Norwood hairloss scale. From reading online, a FUE procedure seems to be the least invasive. Does anyone know anything about the following hair clinics?This clinic is based in Malahide and the hair transplant surgeon is Dr. Sam van Eeden. From looking online, I cannot find any reviews from patients about his work. However, he is a member of the The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons(ISHRS). Places on this board are coveted and difficult to secure - this would imply that he is a good surgeon but I am slightly concerned by the lack of online reviews. I have not heard much about them but they frequently appear in search engines.They carry-out consultations in Ireland but the surgery would be performed in London or Madrid.Right now, these are the three clinics which I am researching for my transplant. If anybody has any feedback/knowledge (positive or negative) about the above clinics, please let me know. If you can recommend any other clinics, it would also be useful.Thanks!
