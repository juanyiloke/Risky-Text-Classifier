Don't Let Dawn BreakBreaking Benjamin - Dear Agony, Give Me a Sign, I Will Not BowI ask myself in slow unsteady voices.. How many times do I have to travel around this mountain? I've cried every tear, broken every promise, seen every low, but I'll keep you alive.. just comfort me tonight, let the lights fade. Don't let dawn break, I'm not ready to see what should have been, what could have been, can't you see I'm only half a man.I'm not blind, but I'm not right, when all seems lost again. I will shut the world away, don't let them take me, just one more night in paradise hell. Tell me a tale, something to soothe this unflinching fight. Tell me, tell me we are not alone and that we are lost together, something to ease my steady decline. I will rise to fall again, just show me the way, just show me.. ¥	Trace likes this
