due to being treated as a "reflux Baby" dd 20 weeks is on spoon feeds and has been for past 6 weeks or so.She now gets a bowl of baby rice with a spoon of fruit puree mixed in, a snack midway through the day of custard or equivalent and supper of mashed Rusk.she's getting 5 bottles but only drinking 4 and messing with one (the one before the bed bottle) and only taking 2/3oz of it.I want to start her on dinners next week ie potatoes, carrots etc what would be the best way to do this replace her wee snack with a bowl of dinner?ÊAlso what is the best way to do this, I won't have time to cook on a daily basis so iv been told freezing a batch and defrosting is the way to go...I'm worried the food will be all watery and mushy after defrosting?ÊAny tips/advice
