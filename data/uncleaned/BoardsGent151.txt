Your biggest fear getting older?Just wondering what your biggest fear is as you get older, or I guess at any age?Mine is health. My biggest fear is getting cancer. You hear of so many people who die because of it.The worst thing is when you hear how people "found a lump one day", then went to the doctor, and found out it had spread, and a few months later, they are dead.I need to go for a checkup to the doctor, just a regular checkup, and I'm going to tell him this, and grill him on what I can do to keep on top of this.I am lucky in that I don't lead too stressful a life, but it's still a big big fear.Ê
