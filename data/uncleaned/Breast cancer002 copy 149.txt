Advice please¥	I have been a member of this group for some time but have never posted a question before. I was diagnosed in July 2014 and had wle x2 and radiotherapy. Had final appointment with oncologist in January 2015. Almost immediately my husband became unwell and was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumour (not confirmed as cancerous yet awaiting pathology results) and he underwent major surgery on Monday called a Whipple procedure. He is recovering well in hospital but has a very dry mouth. I know some of the contributers here have suffered a dry mouth during chemo and I wonder if you can give advice on good things to do when this is the case.
