Public Sector - PMDS. What are my options after disagreeing with my rating?________________________________________I was surprised by an incredibly low rating on my PMDS annual review a few months ago. I heard our director (NOT the HEOs directly above the person being reviewed) had on one occasion previously made sort of an example of an employee she wasn't happy with by ensuring that employee's HEO gave him a very poor rating in his review. They actually left for another job several months later.It has been implied to me one on or two occasions in interim reviews for example that HEOs are 'under pressure' from the Director to give or not give a certain rating to employees they (the HEOs) are reviewing with. Something seemed off about that to me, I guess I had the impression it was at the full discretion of the reviewer HEO. Maybe it's just something the HEO says to the employee to shift "blame" to the big bad Director in the event they give the employee a poor rating - I don't know.It was explained to me that poor records on my clock (some infringements) and some failures to meet quotas (without mention of mitigating factors that interfered) The missed quotas is fair enough, I'm not trying to push my luck here to get a rating any better than I feel I deserve so I won't argue that to be honest. The infringements thing however - they had not been raised as an issue to me in my interim review meetings. They had been raised as an issue outside of PMDS meetings but not in the light of my performance review and rating.I enquired about having the rating appealed to be reviewed by someone else (I haven't signed off on it yet). My HEO was acting as an AP/AD at the time of the first meeting on the annual review and apparently it would have to go before the Director. As I've mentioned above it's already been indicated to me that the whole source of the poor rating being given to me originates from the Director's wishes.What can happen if I refuse to sign off on the PMDS rating number they're trying to give me?I'm due to move to a different section basically now but my new AP and new HEO have said that being allowed to move section (which I really want) is dependent on me competing that PMDS annual review.I want to move but don't want to chain myself to a bad rating for the next whatever length of time it takes to "live down" the bad rating, I feel almost like it's a trap.Thanks for any advice
