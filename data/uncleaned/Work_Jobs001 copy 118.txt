when "customers" steal..what do you do________________________________________if you work in retail, and when you are pretty sure someone has stolen something but you don't have the balls to confront them or you are only like 99.9% certain they have, what do you do?I've wrongly accused people on two different occasions of stealing. One is still is a bit iffy coz I'm convinced he did. Though you have to be 110% correct..if not, you can be in big trouble.Sometimes children can be cagey enough. It's hard to know what to do in certain situations
