I need to get out of this craving!!I have this urge towards milk and milk items that it started to grow on me. I always had this craving and I didn't notice until my friends really stressed on me to put a check on this. I always thought that it was ok and slowly it the feeling changed to it is too late, what can I do? It's fine? Lots of reasons just to keep me going. Finally, my friends helped me into rehabs and consultancies to make me quit the habit. It actually did but after rehab again the same tendency came in me and I continued to be.Now, it is enough and even I feel like I need to quit. I have put on a lot of pounds and I would say a pretty useless body. I want to change myself and I have this urge to get out of it. Currently, I'm under the treatment and I'm holding on to my will, but at times again this craving comes back. I am trying my best to put down that craving, but I'm afraid of losing with it.I'm looking for tips the way I can concentrate on the procedures that the therapist has suggested, and I'm looking for a solution in here.
