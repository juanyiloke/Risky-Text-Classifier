Makes you think !!A chap called John runs our village post office, nice bloke late fifties, always willing to help and a very friendly sort.Whenever I or anyone else popped into his PO to use that service he was nearly always there to help or advise as the case may be and could solve most post office queries in a thrice.ÊI have just learnt that while he was on holiday in Crete he very sadly passed away and arrangements are being made to fly his body home. Now i know to the vast majority of folk on here who never knew him it doesn't have a great deal of significance but this news hit me like a sledge hammer and just goes to show how fragile life can be.Just enjoy life while you can
