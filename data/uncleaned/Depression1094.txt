Not doing so well...I've been...feeling quite low these past couple of weeks. Upon the suggestion of my psych I've tried to isolate what I feel and what I've come up with is what I'm writing here. Problem is that often I can't understand why I feel this way. Anyway...I realised that I feel like I'm being phased out of my own life; that I'm becoming irrelevant. ÊBetween not feeling comfortable at all around my family and feeling like a low priority to my friends, I feel like with everything that I've built up for myself in this life can get along without me now. And life seems to just be erasing me. And on some level, I think I'm letting it.i had to get that thought out across to someone.
