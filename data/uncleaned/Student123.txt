What is life like at the Universities of Glasgow, Surrey and Newcastle?by UgneRHi  I'm going to start a Psychology course this fall but I can't choose between these three universities: Glasgow, Surrey and Newcastle. There are so many criteria to consider... Glasgow is high in the rankings but the other two have great course programs.Since I'm not from the UK I thought maybe those of you who are already studying there could tell me a little bit about the life at those universities. E.g. are the teachers nice, willing to help? Is it hard to find a job/place to live somewhere near the uni? What's the weather like? Thanks in advance!
