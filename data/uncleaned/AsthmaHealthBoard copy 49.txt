Uncontrolled asthma advice please________________________________________Hi, I started having allergies around 2009. By 2011 i began with slight flare ups once or twice a summer where I would take zyrtec and flonase and occasionally albuterol and would be fine in a week. Starting June of this year I have had inflammed longs all summer, occasional shortness of breath. At first the allergist and my family doctor which is also a pulmonary specialist?? Put me on asmanex once a day and flonase two sprays in each nostril once a day and zyrtec. This slightly helped but barely. In July I was switched to two 90mg puffs of pulmicort once a day plus the flonase and zyrtec. During this time I started with a asthma attack where I felt like my lungs were burning, back pain, chest pain, shortness of breath. Went to the er they gave me 20mg prednisone once a day for six days plus my other meds. This did not help at all. Five days after finishing I ended up back at the er with symptoms a little worse then the first time. They gave me a breathing treatment and 4mg of prednisone. I just got home and havrnt started the prednisone yet. My doctor also suggested I start taking asterpro?? I'm just wondering do any of my doses sound low?? What am I doing wrong?? I'm headed back to the allergist on Monday. I've been researching pulmicort and it sounds like 180mg once a day is a very low dose.
