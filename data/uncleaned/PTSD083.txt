Is It Really Ok In Western Societies To Be Mentally Ill???I know, broken record. Sorry - having a shitty day watching my boy -well, like a son to me but not genetically related, hover near death, and even if there is a reprieve right now, it is terminal as it is widely metastasized Cancer beyond any combination of treatments to help - just palliative care. That darkens my mood, but I know death is a part of life.While I should feel sorry for him, my thoughts turn to my own situation. I've fought the concept of "being crazy" for 2 years and 8 months - and no amount of attempting to not be, feel, do, or act crazy actually does any of that. Granted, I can project sane really well, someone not knowing would not know if I put on my game face. I surrender. It wins. I'm crazy. Cra-cra. Looney tunes. Whatever you wanna call it.Now what? When I was told I was crazy in 2012, my instant reaction was "that's it, I'm a walking dead man, American society in all aspects does NOT tolerate the mentally ill."I envisioned all kinds of nightmare scenarios that all ended with my disgrace and death - from being homeless to being locked up.I also knew that various things protect people, from ADA to HIPPA, but I thought "not me, I am a special case". I have functioned for all of that time, not always well, but I've functioned and fought off the Wolves at the door in my key areas of career, home, family, freedom/civil rights.That appears to be the objective, empirically measurable reality for most people with PTSD - they struggle, but ultimately they look like the rest of society in those ways.Please tell me they is true, that no one can "take it away from me" unless I let them.
