ÊI'm a little confused...I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2 in February I believe and I took the Sanity Test and the results had said I had symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, so I went and took the Borderline Personality Disorder quiz and the results said I had severe symptoms of this disorder. I don't really understand what the disorder is or if its a broad term for different disorders. I just want a little bit of clarification and if i should talk to my therapist about it. Thanks to anyone who responds!
