DD is 10 weeks. she generally sleeps well and is an easy baby. In the last week she has started sucking her fist, sometimes her thumb, and is doing it more and more.ÊDoes this mean she is a sucky baby and needs a dummy?ÊAny advice on whether it's better to let her suck her thumb?Êpros and cons as far as I can see are that thumb can be early found by herself in the night, but can't be taken away to stop the habit...She is my third child, but dc1 never showed any inclination; dc2 - I tried to get him to use a dummy (anything to make him sleep) but he just took it out and chewed the hard bit...ÊSo thumb or dummy? what does the wisdom of mumsnet say...
