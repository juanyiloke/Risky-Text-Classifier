I have an eating disorder but I'm not underweightI've been restricting what I eat and on school days I'd only eat dinner with my family because I wouldn't want to worry them but I'd skip that if possible. I lie and say I'm going to friends houses for meals when actually I just walk around for hours just so I can skip meals. I've lost 15 lbs but on days when I have to eat normally my weight increases by around 2 or 3 pounds but I'm still eating less calories then I need so I don't understand why this happens. I am not underweight, but I want to stop having this obsession with food and the horrible guilt I feel whenever I eat. I'm too scared to eat normally and recover though because I know I'll gain weight and if I'm a healthy weight now I don't want that to happen. Any advice?
