Calling all DCUK members-Could you spare a moment to vote on this poll?Hi folks!I know DCUK is as welcome as a fart in a lift with some of us but all round good guy IanD has started a poll over there re success on LCHF with a second vote allowed for those of us who found the standard HCLF peddled by the NHS/DUK to be unsuccessful(HaHa!) with the data going towards Ian's long term lobbying of DUK (The charity).If anyone wishes to help as a current member or maybe a one-off log in over there the poll can be found here.BestPaul
