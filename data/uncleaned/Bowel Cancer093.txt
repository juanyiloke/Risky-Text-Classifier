Psyllium huskDoes anyone use or has tried psyllium husk? In my early days of my reversal I took some but wasn't impressed, but looking back my bowel was all over the place so maybe not a good time to try taking it (Desperate!)I've now been taking it for two days and I think I've seen an improvement in stool consistency. I'm taking a tablespoon per day washed down with some water. It's just the plain husk I'm using but I think you can buy it from the chemist in various flavours?I'd be interested to hear anyone's thoughts or feedbackChoolsThe cost of cancerI was in my early 50's when I was diagnosed with cancer. Post my op I really wasn't well and was off sick for 20 months. I went from a salary onto full sick pay for 6 weeks, and then half pay for a further 6 weeks, and post that benefit of £63 a week. Apart from worrying about my cancer I also had to take on board the issue of money or lack of it. I had a mortgage and all the outgoings that many folk have. In the daytime I heated one room. We bought cheaper food, and somehow we managed to keep a roof over our heads, but it was stressful, and stress we didn't need. I've returned to work part time and we bounce along ok with much reduced incomes (my OH went P/T to look after me and hasn't picked up F/T work since)Cancer is life changing and I'm not complaining (well I might be!), but the current government is making it very hard for anyone on benefits to survive. This week I saw cauliflowers on sale for £1.95, hardly an exotic veg, but if you're on the new benefit of £53 a week, £1.95 is over a quarter of your daily incomeWhat's your financial experience of cancer?Chools
