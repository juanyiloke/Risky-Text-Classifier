Kundalini Yoga Experience?Hi,Two weeks ago I moved to a new city for the summer and I started at a new yoga studio. The first day, Sunday, I went to the yoga studio there was only one yoga class and it was Kundalini. I never believed in chakras and energies and stuff like that. Still, I didn't have anything else to do so I decided to kill some time with this yoga class.During the Kundalini yoga class, I started noticing different emotions rising through my body and childhood memories coming back to my mind. I got curious and went next weekend again. This time the class was focusing on the throat chakra. While we were doing one mantra Ra Ma Da Sa, feelings of sadness and memories surfaced. Few tears rolled down my face. I have hard time experiencing sadness and crying.I was really surprised by the power that Kundalini Yoga has to stir up old buried emotions. I am also somewhat scared by it. Does anyone have experience with this type of yoga?
