First eye screeningI had my first eye screening photo shoot today   The nurse was great, diabetic as well (she said don't eat bread   and enjoyed putting the drops in!) She showed me the pics and said there's a little bulge in both sides but keep your sugar levels low and they'll dissipate, can't say more than she put me at ease, was very knowledgeable and obviously has first hand experience. I met a couple of other club members and had a chat with them, a woman in her 40s who is in limbo diagnosis wise..coeliac and tyoe2 or 1 they're not sure yet (poor woman) and a lovely chap who is 70 and 'not bothered, if I want chocolate I'll have chocolate '  My pupils are still the size of saucers and I'm typing this on an iPod so any spelling errors are copyrighted to me  Hope everyone is having a great day, anyone who is due their first eye screening soon...don't worry!! It's a little stingy for a couple of seconds and that's it...oh, and take sunglasses 'cos you'll see the world in a whole new light when you go out  and really, really don't try and drive after!
