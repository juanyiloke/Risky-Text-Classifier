When other people talk about you......but won't tell you what they are saying.My treatment team is emailing each other and even after asking to be included in the emails they have said no. They say it's a way for me to not have control, since that is one of the issues around my ED.I'm so mad about it. I am trying hard to recover...failing pretty much everyday :(But when I find out there are emails going around and no one will tell me what they say I just wanna give up all together.I'm so mad I wanna stop looking for support every where!
