I don't know how to get back to who I amBasically,Êsince about october i have been on a fast decrease mentally. I was able to cope with my anxiety to the standard of still being able to live, but recently it has gotten so bad. I started missing lessons, and then missing days of school, and then not going at all. I was lucky it fell around christmas so I had three weeks off anyway. However, now it is time to go back, and i just can't - i've told my parents and they said okay. But literally, I am stuck and I see no way out. I know people will say go to school, or you'll sink lower but there is no way i can get that much better in a day. Everybody in school knows about me, and everybody comments. Even people who were friends called me attention seeking, and hearing of one of my friends i might not come back, 'she's doing it all for attention she isn't even that ill.' which hurts me because, i then think oh perhaps i am not and I'm just being stupid. But then i get somewhere and i can't physically get out of my car, or home. We recently went skiing and i skied once for 5 minutes out of ten days, and spent the rest in bed crying. I also bashed my head a few times which is a bad thing for me, and now am sufficiently freaked out. On the way home I am so afraid of crowds, and leaving the car i refused to go to the toilet - for 18 hours even though i was desperate because i couldn't get into the toilet in the services. At home i had to wait until 11pm to eat, because i can't eat at the table without feeling trapped and like i am going to faint which sufficiently pisses off my parents, and right now i feel so alone. My family, and my friends they don't understand, and I can't help but feel like i am alone forever, and this is my life, this is what it's going to be. lying down, crying until i die. I know that's dark, but seriously that's all i see.ÊP.s I suffer, derealisation, health anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, depression and gad.
