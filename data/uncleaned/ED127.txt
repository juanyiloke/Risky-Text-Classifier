Bulimic for 12 years, need supportHello everyone,My name is Andee. I'm 24, and have been bulimic since I was 12. I believe it was brought on by my type 1 diabetes diagnosis at 10 while growing up in a fairly toxic household. Losing control of my body to this disease, combined with an overbearing father and cruel peers landed my chubby preteen self in bulimia hell. I've gone on long stints of recovery but it always seems that it's just a matter of time before my demons return, each time so much stronger than before. I am smart, successful, and kind with several great friends and a job that I love. I live in a great place with a great roommate and have a ton of good in my life, but when I fall into these ruts it's as though all I can see are the negatives, and I live in constant fear. Since my last attempt at recovery, I gained a significant weight gain and in early December it hit me and I resorted back to my old ways. My behaviors have left me feeling like IÕm running on empty. It feels worse than ever yet like food and bulimia is all I have. I used to feel comfortable confiding in family and friends when I was struggling with my ED, but these days I feel like I am too shameful to open up to the people in my life. I am embarrassed, frustrated and fully ashamed of myself right now. I have been isolating and feel as though I am nothing but a statistic - white, middle class, slightly above average weight, 20-something, female bulimic. I hate feeling this way and I am terrified of opening up. I feel trapped, and am posting this as an attempt to find understanding people who I can feel comfortable sharing these things with. Honestly, anything! I am so tired of sitting at home by myself, shaking because I can't take this torture anymore.If anyone wants to talk, here I am.- Andee
