I have DS (22months) and I'm 35. We were lucky enough to conceive him easily. I would like him to have a sibling, and DH is v keen to get going. Sleep has always been bad. I'm tired and the thought of doing it all over again makes my heart sink. I'm only just starting to get my brain and career back. I don't want to sound ungrateful - I adore the family we have. I'd like to expand it but I feel tired and sad at the grumpy person I'm worried it'll make me, in the short term. But I don't want to find it's too late, either. Should I just do it and hope it all pans out? Relationship with DH and DS are both solid. I'd really appreciate some advice, don't mean to sound negative.
