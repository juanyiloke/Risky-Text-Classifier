post radiotheraphy for secondary in neck lymph node.Hi,after surgical resection of secondary lymph node in neck - very rare - oncolgists says. Radiotherapy on area for 4 weeks, with understanding from oncolgist that adjuvent chemo would be required. After radiotherapy event, he said no, see me after next 3 months scan in February - Because I had not had scan since July,I asked specialist nurse for a scan which should have been October.Had this 24.11.14 and follow up with oncologist 2 days later. He then asked me if I 'wanted chemo?' I was shocked,as I would not have seen him on that date-due to no adjuvent chemo, according to nurse, would not see me until Feb 2015. Very worrying situation, as I have told him no to chemo for now. I asked what his advice was, his response was he could not give me any advice - as the situation was unknown to him! Can anyone help with their thoughts as to anyones experience of a secondary going to neck area and not anywhere usual? i.e liver or lung. ( I am pleased it didn't, but would like to know how long this situation will last, if anyone has experience the same scenerio) I would be so grateful, it is all so confusing. Obviously, we all know from this site'everyone is different' - but then, why such similar treatments, if that were the case.? I have had breast cancer in the past, and not such unhelpful responses, like 'everyone is different'.I really do need some help here. Thanks if anyone can provide it.
