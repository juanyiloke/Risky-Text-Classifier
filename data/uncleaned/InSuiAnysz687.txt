I Hate this perpetual cycle of emptiness - I used to toy around with the thought of killing myself many times when I was a teen at 1st but as time passed by it no longer felt like a thought, it's transpired more into an idea and then all of a sudden it all hit me....The endless amount of chaos that I've had to deal with my family ever since I was little, the endless amount of breakups, the endless failed attempts to stay sober, the endless amount of financial crisis, and last but not least the endless amount of deep sadness that I've had to endure all lead to this very moment. Others say suicide is the never the answer but what do they know? they say that suicide is only for the weak, well if being strong means suffering in this lifetime then let me be weak. I'd rather drown in my weakness than bask in an empty victory that will only make me feel more lost. maybe with time this feeling of wanting to die will go away but somehow I doubt it. I truly believe my days are numbered and I'm ok with that. whatever consequences happen afterwards will be my burden alone. so to those of you who want to preach to me, save the sermon bc I have heard all of this crap before and nothing I mean nothing will ever make me feel any different than I do now.
