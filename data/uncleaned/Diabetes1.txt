What was your fasting blood glucose number this am??NewdestinyX, Jun 30, 2011 Hello mates,At a couple of the other forums I've frequented there was a thread like this one where we all sorta checked in each day, with our first cup of coffee or tea, and reported our fasting or waking blood glucose level and some short comment about whether we're ok with it or if not - why not?...It worked well as a sort of 'first thread to check' each morning and post to.I'll start.This morning was a 5.6mmol for me. That's about normal for meWhat about you?
