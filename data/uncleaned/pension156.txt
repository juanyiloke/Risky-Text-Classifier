British couple kidnapped by Somali piratesDoes anyone know what this Country actually does in circumstanceslike this?It does not seem much. If you take the lack of sophistication of theso called enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is very low. Somali pirates are barely on the scale.So what are we doing about it Gordon???Tip: We have Special Forces only a matter of miles away.
