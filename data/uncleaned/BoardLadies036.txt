Female Breadwinners....Apologies if there is a thread on this already I couldn't find one.Basically my other half has left his job and wants to start his own business which leaves me as the breadwinner for the time being. I'll be honest I'm stressed, I don't love my job, I'm good at it and I get on well with most people there but I do it because it gives me the freedom to save, travel and generally buy what I want (within reason). As the sole breadwinner all the extras vanish. Other half had to leave the job (boss was not honest over a lot of things and we just couldn't justify him staying there any longer, he's also owed a lot of money- these are side notes before people ask why etc.) I'm just wondering if there are any other ladies out there supporting their other halfs? I know lots of men do this but I am looking for ladies perspective if possible. How did/do you find it? How/did it affect you planning kids etc..? We live in the Middle East so Mat leave is an issue as I am only entitled to 45 calender days off. Please be gentle its my first time in the ladies lounge!
