VODAFONE REPAYMENTHi all I am confused   .  I held 100 Vodafone shares and read all the hype in the newspapers about our windfall.  Having opened my share dealing account today,  I gained about £101 from the sale of Verizon shares and cash repayment  .  The problem is, I now only own 54 shares  .  I did a few sums, as I am not dead yet and I am now worse off, unless of course the price for Vodafone shares rises to new heights.Anyone else own Vodafone shares?
