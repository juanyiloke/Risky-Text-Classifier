Had a bad Therapy sessionI have been struggling for some time but the last couple of days i felt like my motivation came back and i finally wanted to follow my mealplan and work hard at recovery.Yesterday was a hard day cause i had weigh in and bloodtests before therapy and had to kill time in between hospital and therapy so i was really tired in therapy. I told my therapist that i was tired and why but that i was fine. And my motivation were back. I she said that "you say things are fine but they are not fine" and she kept pushing me and now i feel like motivation is gone again.She is really great though and not rude or anything but i feel so down after this session. And i am not sure why. We didnt even talk about any problems. It was pretty much all about how she thinks i am struggling and not good at the moment. Anyone who have tried something like this? I dont even understand just why i got so upset. I was feeling so much better.
