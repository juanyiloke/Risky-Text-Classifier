testing and carb countingHi all,I'm fairly new to diabetes as only diagnosed type 1just over a year ago, was a big shock as my knowledge of diabetes was next to zero,infact I don't even know anyone else who has it or to talk to about it. So a year in and wow.....what a pain in d ass,lol. I find myself most days skipping the blood test before eating if I feel ok and guessing how much insulin to take i.e... Snack=4 dinner =8 and if something like kfc or something 10. So to the point... I guess I was just wondering if I'm the only person who does this or does everybody work out carb intake exactly. I must stress this is mainly due to having limited time on lunch breaks at work etc. I carnt be the only one not to do it 100% to the book surely????
