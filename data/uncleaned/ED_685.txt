I don't want to relapse :(Hi guys,I posted a few days ago and my thread never appeared. I don't know what I did wrong.ÊI feel like I'm teetering on the edge right now. I need some firm boundaries and a plan. Luckily I'm seeing my therapist today but I'm not sure she'll help much. Mostly we're doing ptsd stuff. Not anorexia stuff ever though she's at the eating disorder ward.ÊA couple of weeks ago we did a visualisation of an incident of abuse from 8 years ago and it unlocked all of these feelings I didn't know I had about it. Since then I haven't been able to eat properly. Before I was doing really well. It was bad timing because I had my planned discharge from the edu daycare last week. I had been there 10 months and before that at another more intensive centre for 11 months. Now I just have therapy once a week.ÊWhen I starve my thinking goes so strange so quickly. I am feeling so irrational like I want to relapse even though I have worked so so hard to get where I am, and relapse would screw up all of the plans I have for this year and my life. I am finding so many things triggering. I have/am deleting everyone from treatment off my facebook because I can't cope with them. Even though it has broken my heart to do so and I have cried my eyes out.ÊBut not having them to check up on I've just moved back to checking all of these damaging AN sites I used to be addicted to up til 2 years ago. I've spent hours and hours looking at really emaciated people this week and I hate it!ÊI'm not sure what I'm looking for from this post. A kick up the backside? Ideas of how to not get sucked into the black hole of AN again?
