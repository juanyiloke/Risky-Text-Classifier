Bedding, vacuuumDo folk have recommendations for anti-mite covers, quilts etc ?I've found that I can relieve wheezing and rhinitis by just buying a new cheapo duvet. What covers work best in your experience ?I try to use high thread count cotton covers when I can, I think they are barriers to dust mite feces from about 290 thread count upwards.I also use a plastic type slip on mattress cover but wonder if I would be better off with a complete zip up cover made from high thread count cotton ?Also- recommendations for vacuum cleaners ? I understand that if a filter is not good enough then ultra fine particles will be blown through it and into the room you are trying to clean.
