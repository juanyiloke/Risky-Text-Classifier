I am!...Just then back their, that moment has pasted, but the truth within me remains forever, absolute and yet transient? The sense I give you I receive visserally, and has inspired me to give myself permission to apply positive vibrations... Anyway back to the heat of the moment? forward to the eternal now?.... Firstly i beleive my trasformation will never be complete and if...correction! WHEN ,availed the oppurtunity by my higher self I will always be evolving to a higher state.... However I envisage having a deep sense of arrival .A saftey..A profound peace beyond my wildest dreams , A wisdom and dignity crafted from my destined experience...and the kindred spirits of others supporting my calling...A mysterious excitment will now extract and manifest a serendipidous existence full of wonder, hope, substance,joy,humillity,and spirituallity...My trasformation will involve a deep pain of healing physical, emotional,mental and spiritual wounds...The road to happy destiny is becoming my sourjoun... 4 Out of the darkness of my life will come an absolute,definete, optimistic power.TIME TO START LIVING..I will activley participate in fullfilling my life missions and that of my fellows...through my inevitable transformation , I am becoming the man i was supposed to be...I AM ALIVE! I NEVER WANTED TO DIE!
