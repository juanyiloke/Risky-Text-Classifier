No work, no friends and wife sick for many weeksI work for a consulting company and still have a job. But have had nothing to do for many many months and very afraid the company might fire me any day. I tried confronting my manager to ask if I would be fired but he always keeps quiet and does not say anything (he is based on the US and does not want to talk on phone and will only answer via chat). The few Australian managers I know do not respond either.ÊHave been applying for many months & do not even get an interview. I have revised my CV more than dozen times. Being in IT for 17 years I thought my skills were valuable...Wife has been sick for 2 months now and wont get out of bed most of the day...feel sad for her since she is very active and loves the sun but is not able to go out at all. She is also over anxious and every time she speaks to me it's only a "i'm in pain...". Doctors as usual have a 2-3 month wait everywhere.Kids are young and have a demanding school life.ÊWake up (though there is no desire to do so)...get kids to school...do the basic household chores (dishes/laundry/tidying)..look for work all day on internet....pick up kids...do some homework or take them to swimming etc....Feeling let down and defeated. thought many times about ending it...if not for my kids..I have no friends or family other than wife/kids...no one to speak to talk about anything...just keep to myself and ride the day...i tried talking to my wife about anxiety of not having work and afraid of loosing job, but she is more worried about her pain so I don't talk to her anymore about it....
