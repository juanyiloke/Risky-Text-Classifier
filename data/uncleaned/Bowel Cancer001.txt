Bowel CancerAfter recovering from Kidney Cancer 5 yrs ago , in Feb this year after 3 months of constant sickness , I was diagnosed with bowel cancer , and after an emergency op I also have a Bag.After 40 days in hospital I came home with Spagetti legs , 8 weeks later I am getting fit again.I have always been fit and healthy and it was a huge shock , why me again with another cancer,! But we survive and adapt and after 3 sessions of chemo, only another 9 to go I am enjoying not working , and having time to potter in the garden , and look forward to the end of Chemo and being able to have winter in the sunshine.I am finding life quite tricky sometimes with the stoma bag, and its going to be trial and error to find one that works best at night .Kelly and Mike , it will get better ,
