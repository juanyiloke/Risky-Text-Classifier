time to stop tamoxifen¥	Five years after cancer and at my latest checkup consultant doesn't even bother to see me, just get handed piece of paper saying keep taking tamoxifen for another 5 years! I don't want to . I want to stop now. I feel I have been under informed during the whole process. I was never given an option to refuse chemo but I would have if they had given me the statistics before rather than after treatment. Now I've developed lymphoedaema and the nurses never answer the phone so no help with that. Really fed up
