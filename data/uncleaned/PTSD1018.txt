hi, I was in a car accident I was six years old, my mother died, I was sexually abused when I was a child too, I just want to know if this could of caused my anxiety I also have bipolar disorder, I have seen therapist I am on meds, and I'm only 24! I feel so scared at times, I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn, is this normal, to feel so scared....my psychiatrist says I have PTSD and mild autism, I just feel I have so many problems, sometimes I get flashes in my head, I can't explain is it normal? I don't want to think something that happened when I was a child could still be affecting me, I feel stupid...anyways thanks...
