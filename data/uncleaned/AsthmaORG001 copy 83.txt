Does anyone else have this? Exercise-Induced Asthma Advice Please!!!! Hi all, I've had my symptoms now for almost 2 years and the medication i'm on doesn't seem to be having any effect. I had an exercise-induced asthma test which was positive and my consultant noted that I showed a significant drop in my oxygen uptake. I only have my symptoms when I do sport and I rarely have any other triggers.I play netball twice a week for a university team and dance maybe once or twice a month on weekends. Whenever I am participating in sport, within three minutes i'm out of breath but I continue on as I don't feel any tightness. If I continue to play, I start retching and get tightness and stabbing pains in my chest. After exercise I am completely exhausted and I go very tired and floppy.The medication i'm on now is slo-phyllin 125mg and Fostair 100/6 mg. It doesn't seem to be having any effect on my symptoms, and i'm just getting fed up :(My mum is in denial of me having asthma. She believes that I have a deep underlying infection despite testing positive for exercise induced asthma and having a chest x-ray which was clear. She believes that I am unfit and I need to enroll on a training programme to boost my stamina and the medication i'm on is too high and i've upset my consultant with my attitude. However, until about 2 years ago I was fine and I could run and do as many sports as I wanted, then all of a sudden out of nowhere I just couldn't breathe.It's very embarrassing to breathe the way I do and I feel so alone. I just wondered if anyone has had similar symptoms to me and how they went about it. I love playing sport and it's the only thing that keeps me goingThanks everyoneVicki (18)
