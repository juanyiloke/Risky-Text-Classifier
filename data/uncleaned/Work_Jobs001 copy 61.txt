new hires getting paid more________________________________________Hi,I'm in my current roles over 3 years... there's 5 in our team ( IT team ) The boss is longest here and I would be second longest here with one other lad. We hired a new guy a year ago and we trained him in. We have 2 open head counts which we are interview for at the moment. By chance I seen what salary the guy we hired a year ago was on and it's 16% more then me.. and i've been training this guy... and do a lot more above my role. I moved in house to the IT team.. and when I moved I got a small wage increase and was happy at the time.. But after seeing the new guy was getting 16% more I'm well pissed off. Not only that but we have 2 open head counts and i'm 95% sure they will also be getting paid more.. I've talked to my boss.. and he has talked to his boss and they said there's nothing they can do.. This happens in IT they said.. where new people come in and get paid more.. I said I couldn't work like this and said I was looking for a new job.. they said they couldn't do anything and would support what I did.Could I go to HR and try re-negotiate my contact ? I've help build this team from nothing as when i joined it was just my boss.The new people joining the team are expected to know a certain amount of HTML / CSS / JS and we teach them how to use the tools etc we us. Knowing the new guy is on 16% more and the new hires will more then likely be on more is effect my work / and my head.. I can't sleep thinking about it.. Knowing the people i'm training / helping on there projects day in day out are getting paid more. Knowing the people i'm interviewing will be getting paid more.. and then I will have to train them. We are finding it hard to fill this roles.. and if I was my exp and applied for the job i'm sure I would ask for 20-25% more than i'm on now and get it... but I can't apply for a role I currently work in   We have tons of work and as I said we have 2 open head counts... If I was to leave they would only have 1 person here that knew the roles and the boss.. the current new guy although here a year still not sure about the tools and processes so he wouldn't be able to train people.... so me leaving wouldn't be ideal for them.. but when i said it they didn't seem to care.. Any advice would be great. I like working here.. and they are a good company.. but this is wrecking my head to much. Thanks.
