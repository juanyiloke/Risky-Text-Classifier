  no energy________________________________________Hi folks. Im a 66 year old retired man. I developed cough variant asthma about 4 years ago and have severe seasonal allergies year around. The doctor placed me on vicodin (5/325) for a torn rotator cuff. Prior to getting the vicodin I had very little interest in anything. No ambition. Often tired but couldn't sleep.Since I've been on the vicodin, I have more ambition and energy. Is this normal?Do I need to see a psychiatrist?I don't want to be on the med because of its addictiveness.Whats wrong with me?
