Not Getting Payed For Public/Bank Holidays________________________________________Hi.It has come to my attention that my wife doesn't get payed for the 9 public holidays we have per year.She doesn't get extra holidays for it either, nothing that I can see.She works in a private nursing that is open 24/7 all year, she is there 7 years, works full time 40hours+ per week and gets 20 days holiday per year.If she doesn't work the public holiday she doesn't get payed for that day, eg last bank holiday week she worked Tues - Fri and didn't get payed for Monday she was off.When she does work bank holidays she gets payed her 8 hours, plus another 8 hours eg double time, it should be triple time as in 8 + 8 + 8How can I solve this without getting her in trouble, she's begging me not to ring NERA, as she thinks they will know it's her and she will be in trouble in work.Is what they doing illegal?Will she get back dated pay if NERA get involved?Or is it not worth the hassle?Thanks for any advice.
