Sorry if this is in the wrong place but I just need some help I have a beautiful 17 month old ds who is our only child. His birth was traumatic for me - 41 hours ending in emergency c - section under general anaesthetic For ages, I felt like I didn't really bond with him - it's hard to explain but I felt like I'd been handed a baby that could be anyone's I had the usual baby blues but nothing major. Had a birth debrief when he was 4 months old but it didn't really help tbh.Fast forward to now and I feel so low  he's lovely and funny and starting to talk but like most toddlers he has his moments and it just stresses me out so much For example, today, we have come out for the day and he created in the cafe - not sure why but properly kicked off  DH can cope with distracting him but I just can't as I feel that everyone is looking at me. It's got to the point that I dread going out with him (even to family ) and would rather just stay at home I do love him honestly, and I would never hurt him. I make sure he has everything he needs and more but I feel so low and sad all the time Me and DH work full time ( teachers ) so it's not that I don't get time apart.I feel so awful - he deserves so much better  I just don't know what to do - I haven't properly told anyone how I feel - not even my mum or husband
