Things a gentleman should be able to doIt seems to me that a lot of skills that would have been common in my father's or grandfather's times are no longer so prevalent amongst the current crop of gentleman. Everyday, simple skills that were necessary or simply advantageous to have in bygone days are falling by the wayside due to changing lifestyles and increasingly omnipresent technology. Why learn how to re-wire a plug when the building's handyman can do it for you; why bother acquiring the ability to tell North from South when an app will do it for you?Of course I'm generalising here. Lots of gentlemen know lots of skills, but I d think that there has been some slippage. And I'm at the head of the pack when it comes to these un- or under-acquired skillsets. So I thought it might be an interesting project to assemble a list of the skills and abilities that a gentleman should have, and set about working on the list in the new year. Maybe acquire a new skill every two weeks or something.And, not having acquired the skill of compiling exhaustively complete lists, I thought I'd turn to the upstanding denizens of The GC for inspiration. Put simply, can you add a few skills or abilities that you believe every man should have in an ideal society. Anything and everything can be included, but try to keep it somewhat serious!I'll start with a few:1. The ability to wire a plug2. The ability to sew a button onto a shirt/ simple darning3. The ability to chart a course using the sun or stars or other natural methods4. The ability to change a tyre on a carAnd so on and so forth...(this is where you lot come in!Ê)
