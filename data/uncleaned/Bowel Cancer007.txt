wish me luck! - update!Hello all,Well went for my pre op on Thurs for my vats thymectomy op. Was booked in for Friday 1st but they want me in this Sunday now! Feeling a little apprehensive but feel like I'm a pro at this malarky now - 4 ops in 18 Months. They reckon i should be in theatre for about an hour ( bit different to the 7 hr first op) if all goes to plan and 2 -3 days in hospital. Not having this op at local hospital as there are no thoracic surgeons so have to Go to heartlands in Birmingham - little nervous about the unknown of the hospital but looking forward to a new experience in a bizarre way! Will keep you updated - sorry I've not been around much, I've been reading just not typing
