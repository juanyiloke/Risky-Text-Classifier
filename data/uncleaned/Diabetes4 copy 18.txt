Long Term Sickness/Disability Benefits and LifestyleI saw a program on this the other evening and felt I had to comment. The program dealt with those who were on long term benefits as a result of sickness due to lifestyle. The main topics covered were smoking, drinking and over eating.I did feel sorry for a man of 57 who had lost a leg to smoking, will probably not live much longer and may lose the other leg if he continues smoking. However if he stops smoking now the withdrawal symptoms may induce a heart attack. Part of my sympathy may come about as I suffer from PAD. Why a young man with a persistent cough who has been shown to be otherwise healthy continues to smoke is beyond me. The part that bemused me most was a young woman of 21 who weighed in at 30 stone. She had changed GPs because one had told her that weight was no barrier to work (although I suspect it would stop many people employing her). At this young age she already had a number of health issues related to her weight and they suspect she is developing Type II. When I approached 17 stone a few years ago I started to feel uncomfortable in my body so goodness knows what 30 stone feels like.Being at an age where I have been to too many funerals caused by addictions including these and drugs I really struggle to understand why people are not getting the message and continue on a route to self destruction. But maybe I am getting old but still want to enjoy life for many years to come.
