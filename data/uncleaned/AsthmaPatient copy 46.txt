Asthma Hello, my name is Gracie and I am 9 yearold. I have joined this forum because I have had asthma for my whole life and have to spend a lot of the time in hospital so the doctors can help me breathe abit easier. When I am we'll enough I go to school. I have special masks to wear when I am not on the machines in hospital otherwise breathing is very hard for me. I also have to take a lot of medicine at school and have to lay down in class for some of the time or i get too tired. I have a helper and he is very kind but alot of the other children laugh at me when I am having trouble breathing and wearing my equipment. Without it I would have to be in hospital even more but they don't have asthma so they don't understand. Is it like this for everyone or how can I make them realise that i have asthma and need my treatment and medicine? I do not like being ill but I can't help it
