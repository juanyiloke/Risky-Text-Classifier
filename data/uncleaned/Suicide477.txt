I'm badBad Teacher. Bad Sister. Bad Mother.I wish I had the courage to do what some of you want to do. I live a sad life – just don’t have the type of personality that can be liked. My sister has always hated me – calls me the worst sister and as a result we haven’t spoken for 8 years. The children at school hate me because I expect them to abide by the rules and to deliver good work. My own children hate me – can’t do anything properly in their opinion. It doesn’t matter how hard I try – I will just never be good enough. Wish I was dead!!! Just can’t take it any more.
