Out Of The Loop - Disconnected - DownÊ  OutOfTheLoop ,Ê04 May 2015Since one of the common recommendations to people suffering from depression is to write down how they feel and journal their thoughts, I have decided to go ahead and do exactly that right here. I don't only want to use this thread as a kind of diary of my depression, but I am also interested in any response people might give. I honestly doubt you could make it any worse.ÊI have been depressed ever since hitting puberty, with signs of this condition which I have inherited from my parents showing up already way before.ÊI have tried talk therapy, but it never clicked with me. I must have had too many expectations, and people never told me what I was supposed to expect. I thought I could waste my time more productively.ÊI have also been prescribed several antidepressants: citalopram/escitalopram, venlafaxine, bupropion, aripiprazole, just to name the active ingredients. The effect has always been either none or negative. My doctor even suggested that drugs may not be helpful in my case, at which I freaked and stopped seeing him, thinking he had pretty much given up on me.ÊRecently, I checked myself into a mental health clinic after leaving behind one of the most disappointing and damaging periods of my life (of which I will have to speak in greater detail at a later time). I felt safe there, had the first above average talk therapist in years, but they checked me out after two weeks because they judged me stable enough. Now I am living with my parents and I am seeing another therapist who is alright. I am going to give it a chance.ÊOther than that, just waiting for change.
