Will Schizophrenia ever go away?Hi, I was diagnosed with Psychosis in mid 2006 which I also learned on my own that I was having Schizophrenia as well.My Psychiatrist put me under different medications from time to time. Now I have a different Psychiatrist and different medication as well, I am now using risperidone 2mg x2/day.My question is "Am I still going to have a time when I won't have to use this medication anymore?"I asked my doctor about it even before and he tells me not to worry as long as I follow his advice. But my problem here is that I have been taking medications since 2006 and every time I miss out to take my MEDs for more than 3 days - the voices in my head always start to come back, and they say I had a relapse so i have to start the process all over again.Will I be having this medication for the rest of my life? Or will this surely end in some point in time?Please help and shed some light. Thanks!
