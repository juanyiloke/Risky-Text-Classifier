Brittle ashma Help with brittle ashma My Daughter has brittle asthma which started when she was 18 she is now 21. Her attacks are now so severe that she is in hospital usually one a month and has been resuscitated twice this year. She is a very positive person who was a great sports women. I am worried about her future, what jobs she would be able to do with this condition and also that she will die. I have to keep all these feelings to myself as she is such a positive person and acts like she doesnt have a problem which in itself is a worry but I know that, that's how she copes with it which is a good thing. She doesn't always let me know if she is in hospital and recently she was airlifted to hospital when she was at home during the holidays. Nobody told us and I ended up driving round the town trying to find her before calling into our local hospital who rang round for me to find out where she was. Is there any hope for people with this condition when it is so severe. I would welcome any advice from anyone who is living with this or who is a relative or Mother of someone who is living with this condition.
