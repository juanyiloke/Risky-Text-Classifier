Romanian gypsiesÊ ÊPerhaps it is just me, but I think this country is going to the dogs. The Muslim deadbeat Anjem Choudary who claims he is proud to receive £25,000 a year in benefits from the British taxpayer, this person, his friends and others like him suck the taxpayer dry. Today we hear of some Romanian gypsies that have come here and have applied for all the benefits that they are entitled to.ÊÊ Ê Yet the pensioners get a pay rise of £2 38 per week, and when we reach the age of eighty we can have another 25p extra. To buy exactly what with?Ê Ê ÊToday I hear that we are to give six million pounds to aid those in the Haiti earthquake. There is a government department called UKaid that is charged with giving away seven point five billion pounds to other countries that they consider worthy. We have given away millions to third world countries to help in the prevention of global warming.ÊÊ Ê Ê Considering that we are supposed to in deep deep debt, where is this money coming from? If we can afford to give away money like this why can they not afford to give the pensioner in this country a little more?Ê Ê Ê ÊAm I being unreasonable to expect less to be given to immigrants that are here to bleed this country dry and more to given to those who have worked a lifetime for this country?
