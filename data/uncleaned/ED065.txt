the korean standardsHi, I'm new here and I'm really looking for some help. it's not easy for me to talk about my eating problems because my asian culture and cuisine makes it hard for me to talk to a counselor in the US. It started a year ago, when I began to restrict my food and began exercising obsessively.the reason for this was because my korean friends were obsessive about skinny k pop models and I joined in. After a month, I started to have binges that I didn't understand. It was confusing and shocking to me and I tried to solve that by exercising more and restricting myself more. Later I found out it was binge-eating anorexia. I never found help because I felt too ashamed. It affected my social life bc I refuse to eat out with friends and after a few months, my body weight was so low that my hair fell out and I stopped having my period. I cant even enjoy my favorite foods because of the fear that I will lose control. but after joining my high schools cross country team. I finally found peace with myself. I stopped having binges and I was truly happy even though I still wasn't eating enough. I was at thinner like i always wanted to be. And my korean friends all complimented how skinny i was.But cross country ended and for a few months I was distressed and I kept binging again. I gained weight ((mostly muscle god I hope)) I was playing soccer at that time. I want to lose weight of course but I don't want to go through another eating disorder. I want to lose weight in a healthy way where I won't have any binges but it's so hard to control that. If anybody can help. Please help me.
