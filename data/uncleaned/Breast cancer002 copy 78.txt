Red Breast syndrome¥	Hi All,¥	2 weeks today since our op for an IDC in the left breast and lymph nodes. My wife was in for nearly a week post op then home for 2 days before going back in with what was thought to be and infection. No symptoms other than a red patch on her re built left breast and small amount of swelling. Our consultant admitted us immediately and we began a course of IV antibiotics. No temp and BP and bloods all came back clear. We have been told it may be red breast syndrome. Has anyone on here had experience of this? Thanks in advance. Will add more to my previous post under the heading of Nervous Husband when I get a mo. Suffice to say other than the infection/RBSyndrome we have been nothing but positive thru out.  Chris xx
