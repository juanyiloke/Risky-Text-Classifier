Running away?Good EveningI am new, and not sure this is the right place to post this, but I really don't know what else to do.I have an almost uncontrollable urge to run away... physically, mentally, in whatever way possible. I am battling depression along with other things, and have four small children all five and under that i am raising now as a single parent for the last seven months, due to an abusive ex husband...I cannot seem to get rid of this feeling to run. Everytime i am outside my house i can go walking for hours, a simple trip to the grocery store turns into two hours. I have to convince myself to come back home, and the minute i am here, i cannot wait to leave again. I have gone walking for 4 hours straight, and it was still hard to come back. I can visualize myself running as fast and as far as possible into the horizon and never looking back once. Just a continuation of running that never ceases...ÊIt scares me, and i am afraid i may run from my children in the physical sense and not just imaginary. How do i regain control, and why do i feel this way, why can't I put a stop to this urge, this ovewhelming need to seperate from myself and my entire known world, to run without living or feeling or thinking about anything. I believe i love my children deeply, and I don't want to abandon them, perhaps that is why I return every time. Simply because i worry about them not having anyone else to care for them, but even when i am with them the thoughts to bolt out the door are there, haunting me.If there is anyone who can shed some light on this, help me to understand it, and maybe offer suggestions i would greatly appreciate it.. i am at my end as to what i can do.Thank you!
