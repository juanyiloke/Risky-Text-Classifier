Can't stop thinking about dieingI keep thinking about suicide and dieing.Even though sometimes I don't feel like attempting. But for whatever reason no matter how happy I am it's all that runs through my mind. It's as if is my destiny to end my own life. And me keep thinking about suicide is driving me more and more to try and end my life. I can't look at myself in the mirror. It just makes everything worse. Can't stand being around people just like to be alone with my thoughts. I hate my life I can't stand this shit anymore. Somebody help me
