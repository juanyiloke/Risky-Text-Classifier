It's really warm here, which probably hasn't helped, but I feel like I've been directing ds, 3.7, and dd, nearly one, all day. We've been in town and I've had to say "don't touch that" "come here" and "in a minute" every five seconds it seems! Dd in particular is just confident walking now and wants to do so at every opportunity. I had DS brought back to me by security in the mall (I could still see him but dd had fallen over) and the shoe shop lady was pretty humourless when it came to dealing with exuberant children. It was a trip to get dd's first shoes and I just felt stressed  And breathe. Does anyone else feel like this?! Not shouting (I do enough of that too) but just loud directing? All. The. Bloody. Time.
