Miserable at work________________________________________Hi I work for a government dept and am having a horrible time at work. I know that I should be thankful that I have a job and I am. I am a manager in a role where there are a number of staff of the same grade working together . One of my colleagues who is the same grade is extremely underhand and has the ear of the boss with whom there is a long workplace history. There is constant sniping and shows of superiority but in a very subtle manner. I am at the stage where I am dreading going to work (I have always loved my job) and having trouble sleeping/coping. I'm not the only target. There is no point complaining as the boss will dismiss any reports as baseless as they go back so far and the notion that the sun shines out this person's backside. I have queried a transfer with HR and have been advised that transfers are not priority and that the mobility policy will take precedence this year although they couldn't confirm when. They also suggested a head to head transfer. I'm not sure I can continue working in this environment. Any advice on this matter would be appreciated.Thanks
