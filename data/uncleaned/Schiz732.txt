ÊNeed help from you at riskSir I am taking schizophrenia treatment from the past 12 years and suffering from severe depression and anxiety since 2000.At present I am unemployee.From the past 2 years my doctor started giving good treatment and at present I am not getting sleep.Fortunately or unfortunately I am getting married with in 10 days. I don't have any sexual experience previously.I have been addicted to computers,smoking and also I am innocent.I am thinking that I am impotent on using medicenes,smoking.I hope that I can perform sex well if I get good sleep.At present thoughts have been reduced a lot but I am not getting sleep.Can I marry without any worries.Can you please suggest any solution for my problem.Regards,X.
