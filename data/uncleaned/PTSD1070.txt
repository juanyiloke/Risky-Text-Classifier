15 Years ago I was involved in a seriour Road accident, knocked down by a landrover, coma, died, brain damage and PTSD all as a result. I have always been a strong minded determined achiever. Told on leaving hospital that I would have to learen to know a new me !!!!!!!!!! Eh? went back to work against Doctors wishes and stuck it for four yearsa, always in denial then it broke me. Went to the Doctors and he said, nicely, told you so, you cant deal with it aND ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO. 15 years on, still in denial, brain damage doesnt affect me, severe mood swings, anger, verbal outbreaks, lost two wifes and 2 daughters, lost all friends pre accident, i dont understand people and dont feel they understand me, spend most days apart from going to the shop, in my house on my own, i dint understand or like life and feel like it doesnt understand or like me ! I done even like me so why should anyone else. God, sorry, Ive been woffling, or BDW as I call it, brain damage waffle, I go on and on and on and I am so opinionated ! Not quite sure wot im doing here but any replies ? please !
