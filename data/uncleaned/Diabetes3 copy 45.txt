Totally confused And Disillusioned Over Blood Sugar FiguresCame in from work yesterday and took a reading.6.9.Went for a brisk 30 minute walk,as I do every day.Came home and waited for about 15 to 20 mins and took another reading,4.4.This morning,got up at about 8-30 and took reading half an hour later,7.0.Went for walk and repeated the whole procedure,yet sugars had risen to risen to 7.3.Why is this.Nothing seems to follow a pattern.Hence doing something good one day and doing the same thing the next has 2 opposite effects.How on earth is anyone supposed to live a life like that.Does anyone on this planet have a bloody clue about this disease or is everything pure speculation.Rant over,but can you see why I am so disillusioned.
