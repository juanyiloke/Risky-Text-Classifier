Regret and winter bluesHi allFinding myself feeling really low today. It's been cold and wet today and getting dark earlier and I just seem to get depressed as a result.ÊThen when I'm in this "funk" I start to obsess over things I've done in the past and things that have happened and feel intense guilt and regret. I'm also not very well physically and struggling to see a light at the end of the tunnel or imagine a day when I'll feel better.ÊAnyone else experience the same feelings, particularly in winter? What do you do to cope?
