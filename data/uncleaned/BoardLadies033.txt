What do you do that gives other people energy?I just watched an interview in which a dancer said he thought his jumps gave his partner energy because she watched them from the side.ÊFor some people it's cooking or telling jokes. Or sports.How do you give positive energy to others?ÊAlso I know I have not answered because I am still trying to figure out how I do or even how I can.ÊBut I just thought it was interesting. I think singers get energy from the choir etc. And people get positive energy from animals or music or nature etc.ÊI think when you truly have given positive energy you don't feel drained but energized.ÊAnyway sorry if this seems weird or silly.
