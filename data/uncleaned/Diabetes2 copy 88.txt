new here   just found this tonight after a nurse pointed me here to look at something else.I have been diagnosed T2 2002 aged 32 . i have managed to reduce my A1c from 10.4 to 6.1. since going on insulin last year it has crept up to 6.9.i am still working hard at controlling it and reading as much as i can.i have been on virtually every medication there is for diabetes and they all failed miserably. diet is the ONLY true way of controlling it. The problem is, what is the TRUE diet?I have found through regular BG testing that including 'plenty of starchy carbohydrates' in my diet was NOT the correct way. unfortunately for me it was after 6 years of blindly believing what i was told to do. my pancreas now is virtually useless and i now need basal and bolus injections.I have spent the last 2 years educating myself from various forums on the internet and reading books written by endocrinologists and other diabetics. i now feel i have sufficient knowledge to deal with it, sadly it is 8 yrs after the event.It is my aim now to help as many people as i can.
