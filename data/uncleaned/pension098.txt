SECURITYMay I warn my fellow contributors to this site about things that have happened to me recently.I have had to change my Bank A/C, Debit card and virtually everything else which is remotely connected with my finances.I was what is called hacked, access was obtained to my personal finances. This it appears, was all because that I did not follow what is now deemed to be good practise: I did NOT remove so-called cookies at the end of each session, and I left myself permanently signed in to this and one other site. The cost to me has been £608 and almost three weeks of hell.I HAVE NO ONE ELSE BUT MYSELF TO BLAMEPLease, Please take care - there is a whole army of evil'b's out there trying to rip off pensioners!
