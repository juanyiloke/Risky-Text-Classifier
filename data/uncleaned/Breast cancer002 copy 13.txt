New to the group and very worried :(¥	Hello all,I'm new to the group today and am pleased to meet you all.¥	I'm currently waiting on an urgent referral to a breast clinic after noticing a few changes in my right breast.¥	I'm trying so hard not to worry until I have any reason to but I keep feeling so panicky and am sleeping badly.¥	I "feel" there is something wrong as well as the other breast changes.¥	I'm a single working mum to a six year old and worry how I will cope mentally,physically and financially if I get a bad outcome.
