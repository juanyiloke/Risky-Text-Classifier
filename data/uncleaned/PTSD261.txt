I watched child porn 10 years ago and it hit me now...by Iwatchedit » Fri Apr 04, 2014 3:45 pmI need HELP! I am 27 years old and when I was 17 I watched child porn someone gave me. It involved a very young girl around 5. I stopped watching it after a while and totally blocked it out and was in denial. recently for the last year or so the memory came back to haunt me and I have severe paranoia and guilt and suicidal tendencies. I almost jumped infront of the train tracks twice. i have this constant physical pain in my whole body because of it too. I stay in bed all day in pain and paranoid thoughts and voices. I m not a pedophile though. I m just obsessed with the thought that I contributed to her exploitation and keep thinking about it. Its been a long time but in my mind I m living it like it happened now. I go to a psychiatrist that gives me lorazepam and risperdal. Still the pain and paranoia is severe. before I admitted it to myself and broke down I suffered from delusions and grandiosity butthat stopped after I admitted it to myself.. I need a way to forgive myself and cope with it. Give me your advice or share your experiences with watching such things..
