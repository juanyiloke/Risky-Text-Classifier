Feeling Happy :-) My lungs passed the ultimate test this morning!!! I've been ill for quite some time, started with a severe chest infection in January and it took a long time for me to feel well again so i've been adding my activities back in gradually.This morning is the first time i've fell well / confident enough to try the last thing i haven't done yet! I went out and did nearly 3 miles run and my chest felt quite tight afterwards, needed 4 puffs over about 10 minutes to sort it but i then went into the leisure centre and did 50 lengths of the pool in 40 minutes and felt really strong! Even better i haven't spent the day coughing like i used to do before i was put on Seretide in December!!!
