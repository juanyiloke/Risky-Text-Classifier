ÊRantAbsolutely hate when people are dismissing your experiences.They put on ther judgemental face and shake there head.And hate when people say they are there for you , yet hey all think about themselves you say u care but u don't you are a fuckin liar I hate you.I'm in mental agony but no one seems to care and ther seems to be nothing that can help me I feel like a lost cause I can't keep going on like thisWhy me? Fuck my life
