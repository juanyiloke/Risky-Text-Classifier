Commenting on other people's weightI have a similar thread over on the 'ranting and raving forum' but felt it was applicable here too.I have a friend, whom I dearly love, but she is obsessed with people's weight and is FOREVER passing comments.It could be people we know: 'God, she's after getting very pudgy' to 'she could loose a few pounds off the face' to random people on the street 'look at the ass on her', 'Christ, did she look in the mirror'.Eventhough when she says these things it is usually in a whisper, I feel embarassed. I am not a skinny minny myself though I have lost alot of weight in the last few years, therefore I know what it is like to be overweight and feel people are staring at you. What is worse is some of the people she comments on (pictures on Facebook etc) aren't actually overweight. They might be heaver than her but they aren't overweight to me nor I'd say do they think they are either.What is also embarassing is if you are clothes shopping and we are looking for a size in says a top or trousers...anything bigger than a 14 she pushes out of the way and says 'christ, all huge sizes'. Meanwhile, I feel like I'm cowering in the corner, as although I'm 90% of the time a size 14 in a pants/trousers, depending on the make, sometimes I get a 16. What is worse is she has worn that size in past too.ÊAnyone else similar experience. I try to ignore it when she says it as I don't want to fuel it, but it is hard not to go to the opposite extreme and tell her how out of line she is.
