Im due to go on a hen do in 6 weeks time and I'm already having nightmares about it. DS is breastfed but will be a little weaned by then and also will take a bottle. He will be with DH, but he is obviously very attached to me currently, we co sleep and I have a tendency to take over when he cries. I am making a real effort to leave dh to it and plan to have a few practice evenings out beforehand but im tempted to cancel just so I dont have the anxiety over the next few weeks.ÊI think one of the big issues is that we are going about 40miles away and the bus home isnt booked til 2am. Am I bonkers for even thinking I can do this? ?How/When did everyone leave their first born for the first time??
