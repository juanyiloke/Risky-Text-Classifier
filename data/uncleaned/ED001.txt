reliving the same week/ keep losing and gaining weightI have relived the same week for a few weeks now. I make healthy choices Monday-Friday and Saturday and Sunday I make such bad choices i gain all the weight I lost throughout the week back.I always get a new book and get motivated and i can lose weight and then gradually i start yo-yo-ing again, sometimes it feels like after my long stressful work week and keeping it together i end up loosing control and hiding from the world on the weekend.Consumed with thoughts of food. wanting to eat any and everything. sometimes i can just have the thoughts of food and not act and other times i eat so much i feel sick then go back an hour later and finish what's left and then feel sick again.it can take me the 5 weekdays to lose some weight then i eat bad all weekend and gain it all back. i think i can lose weight at first because they are the unhealthy food pounds and the contrast of the healthy eating makes the weight fall off.i have been trying to eat a healthy diet and i was doing really well eating this way for weeks, now i have regained the weight and keep obsessing about food.i just want to fuel my body and live a healthy life. it seems like there's an emotional need that calls out for bad eating after i haven't indulged in a month or so. i just want to wake up everyday without the stress and problem of figuring out how to eat healthy and avoid wanting to eat anything i want. anyone else ever struggle in this way?
