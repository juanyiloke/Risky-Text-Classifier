taking over a family restaurant2012-04-25, 11:45 AMjust looking for some advice from people who are unbiased.I am 24 and from a very successful family, my mom is bascially the outcast and the only one of 8 kids with no wealth, we grew up pretty humble.my great grandparents founded a restaurant which became very popular, (ever had the french fries at cedar point back in the day?)my grandparents took this business and expanded it into 4 restaurants, all now independently owned by their children.my aunt and uncle(brother sister) took over the one I work at and made it very very successful, bringing in profits of betweem $ 300,000 and 350,000 yearly for about 15 years now. they have shown profits even during the economic downturn.They are getting old and want to sell to me and my cousin, we were like brothers growing up. He just graduated with a degree in criminal justice and I am in school for business administration, which I am 2 years in but taking classes slowly.Êthey basically told me they would fund the pruchase, we would need to get a loan for $300,000, which will hopefully be obtained through my cousin and I owning 20% of the business as collateral. the other $500,000 will be personally funded through my aunt and uncle. they want to teach us everything we should need to know over the next 5 years and basically give us all the opprotunity.thing is, I am not a leader. I started out working in the dish room and worked my way up to manager, but I have a very difficult time with people. they dont respond to me and I command no respect. I am working on getting better, but I need to iron out my personal life before anyone will look up to me.my question is, even though I love to cook and work in restaurants, I am scared that no one will respect me and I am not fit for an ownership role, is this a viable concern or am I overthinking things and everything will come with time.
