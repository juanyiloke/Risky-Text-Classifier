My seraquel medication doses has been upped from 400mg to 600MG and I am sleeping better but now my heart every now and then beats so fast I think I am having a heart attack. I am not sure it is directly connected but it the only medication that has changed recently. also, I am gain weight at a rapid pace because I am hungry all the time. I do mindless eating at night and not even know I am doing it. My Shrink just ups mymedication when I cannot sleep and I am already up to 280 lbs and am afraid of what will happen if he keeps uping it. He is pig headed and thinks he knows everything. It is so frustrated to not be heard and not putting the whole patient first and quit worrying about your kick backs from the pharmaicutical companies. I just do not know what to do. I am on disability so I am stuck with my shrink for a while. What is a girl to do??
