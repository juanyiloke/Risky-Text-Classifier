DD aged 6 is stressed because six months ago, a classmate asked to borrow something precious to her (a wristband given at assembly for effort in maths).DD felt she had to say yes 'because I didn't want to hurt her feelings,' and also because the girl was nearly a year older and part of the hero-worshipped cool girls group. Then, instead of carefully tending the wristband and returning it with proper gravity, the girl who borrowed it took it off and left it lying around! Luckily sharp-eyed DD nabbed it back before it could be lost.So she doesn't want to go to school because she feels she has to say yes to things she isn't comfortable with, to please people. We've tried 'would they do the same for you?' to filter out which people to say yes to, and 'you don't have to say yes,' but it's a minefield.Any suggestions? Thanks
