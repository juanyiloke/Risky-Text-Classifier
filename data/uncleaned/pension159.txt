GoldfishYou really can't make it up - if this had been a "story" in a magazine as a piece of fiction I/WE surely would have laughed at the very idea.ÊNow I know Littlejohn and the Daily Mail are not everyones cup of tea but read the article and weep for this country, who are these people councils/magistrates etc. that even in their wildest fantasies could come up with these sentences. Where I disagree with Littlejohn is when he says they were treated like hardened criminals - they were treated much worse than many hardened criminals.From time to time I think how on earth can "this or that" be topped - A bulemic John Prescot springs to mind!!Will this "Goldfish" story be "topped" How can it be??
