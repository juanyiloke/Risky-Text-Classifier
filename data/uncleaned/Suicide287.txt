Êneed a place to talkI'm feeling so horrible right now. Fever, nausea, and very sad.ÊA guy told me he doesn't want to be with me and it really affected me.ÊI'm so sad I feel like crying and giving up.Last night I wanted to die.. And I almost wanted to die again a few minutes ago...Is my life even worth it?What's the point?YES, cognitive therapy has helped me a lot.. I use an app on my phone to change my negative thoughts... What's the point though if I can never be happy? Or if suicide really is just a better option? I'm so tired of being depressed all the time. I want someone to love me. I wish someone would be here and tell me that I'm worth it... I really thought he loved me... I feel so bad right now...
