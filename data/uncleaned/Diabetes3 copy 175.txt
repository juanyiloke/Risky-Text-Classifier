Just curious...Hi everyone I have a question which may sound daft but it's got me wondering.As a type 2 when I eat carbs my bg rises depending on quantity and type eaten If I have something like chocolate or biscuits I get quite a sharp rise, maybe up 3 points or more gradually coming down after an hour or 2. Before I started low carb eating I'm ashamed to say my diet was mainly chocolate and a lot of high carb food in meals All meat cooked in sauces from jars and desserts by the truck load ...you get the picture. But my fasting bg and hba1c didn't really reflect it. And after-meal readings on the odd time I did them were never much more than 10. I know that's too high but I go higher now with a banana or bowl of muesli! It doesn't make sense to me Why were they not higher? I dare not try it but wondering if I have a real binge like a high carb meal and dessert followed by a big bar of chocolate (afraid to admit I could do it!) and maybe more, would my level stop going up once it peaked at say 12? Or would it keep going up and up? Could my readings have been regularly over 20 before?   Hope the question makes sense and someone can answer it Thanks
