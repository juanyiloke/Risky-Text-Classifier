ÊThe question of a second opinionWell I had the day off today and went to the gp and asked for a second opinion. He asked me to go further with what I want and I didn't really know what to say. He asked me the history of my consultants (ie who I have seen) and then asked whether I would want a private or NHS second opinion. I said I would think about it. Once I had left the surgery I thought really regardless of whether it was a private or NHS doctor they should come up with the same result. I must admit it would be a stretch to fork out for a private doctor.The gp was quite pleasant today and said that the appointments I am given by the consultant and the meds aren't compulsory. I pointed out that the consultant won't take no for an answer and he said he thinks the hospital will write to me to offer me an appointment in 6 months time.I hope you all have a devine weekend.
