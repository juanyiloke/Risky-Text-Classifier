We're on day 3. Day 1 lots of accidents in the morning then a couple of successful potty wees in the afternoon. Day 2 no accidents until 4pm when there were a few in quick succession, and a slightly traumatic trip to grandma's at lunchtime where he was dying for a wee but got stage fright and couldn't go so we had to go home  he did his first poo without a nappy yesterday afternoon and nearly made the potty. Day 3 (today) he's done one successful potty wee and has spent most of the last two hours sitting on the potty. Is this normal? Am worrying about when he goes to nursery on Tuesday, what if he gets stage fright there and holds it in all day? He was so upset yesterday, it broke my heart.
