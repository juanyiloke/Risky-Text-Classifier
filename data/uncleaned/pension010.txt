Narrow escapeMy son had a narrow escape last weekend: he was helping out in the garden of an elderly neighbour who is no longer able to do the work himself. There is an outhouse in the garden that had been thickly overtaken by ivy. My son got up a ladder to begin clearing it back when, suddenly, a hidden snake emerged and shot past his face. He was lucky on two counts: it didn't bite him (it was an adder); and he didn't fall off the ladder. As CC also saw a snake in an unexpected place last week, I thought it might be timely to warn anyone clearing overgrown garden that adders do seem to be about at the moment, and just to proceed with some caution.
