Does your heart speed up when you're having trouble breathing?________________________________________When I have restriction in my breathing it seems to directly effect my heart right away. My heart beat will speed up really fast and be pounding very hard while I feel like I'm breathing through a straw. And when I'm aroundcigarette smoke I have heart palpitations. Some times, just the act of standing up will cause my heart to start pounding. Often I notice my pounding heart first before I even realize that my lungs are restricted. It's like the two go hand in hand. So I think the restriction in my lungs, which can get triggered by physically exerting myself or even standing up, is causing my heart to speed up. But, the weird thing is, I have asked other people with asthma if their heart beat does that when they are having trouble breathing and they said no. So, I'm wondering why mine does then.
