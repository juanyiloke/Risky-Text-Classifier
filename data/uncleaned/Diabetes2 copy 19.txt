T1 Diabetes and PMR  2  I was diagnosed with PMR 6 months ago and am currently taking Prednisolone which has a big effect on my diabetes control. I am having a bit of trouble controlling my blood sugar levels and keeping them out of double figures. The levels are not consistent so counting carbs can be a problem. I test before I eat and try to tailor the insulin to the food I am eating but it seems very hit and miss and I sometimes end up with a hypo or a 20+ blood sugar result for no reason that is clear to me. I am eating a low carb diet but not cutting it out completely. My consultant has put me forward for a DAFNE course which I hope will help. Has anyone had a similar experience or any practical advice for me.
