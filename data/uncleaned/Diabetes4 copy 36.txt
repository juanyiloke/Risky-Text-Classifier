3 months Post Libre resultsSo back in November i had a Hba1c after a month of so of libre use and it was down, so i asked the nurse if i could have another A1C test after 3 months of usage to see if it had an effect on hba1c. My a1c has always been high, but was reducing. Here's a little summary of my results that I can find for youI've been using the libre part time (2 weeks on, 1 week off). You should also bear in mind that i can't filter out the dodgy sensor i got from the summary below, but most of my sensors have been fine. The 3 month summary suggests an a1c of 6.6%. Inflating this a bit still suggests my a1c is likely to be much improved. We will see later this week how accurate the software is. I know you lot like data so there are a couple of extracts attached below. PS - December will contain "christmas holiday guesstimating chaos" and February contains "lurgy influenced bgs"
