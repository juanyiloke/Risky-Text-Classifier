Constant Shortness of Breath________________________________________I got a bad sinus infection that lasted several weeks in November. This led to shortness of breath. My gp gave me a two week trial of Dulera that I started at the beginning of January. After a couple of days, the SOB completely went away. I finished the two week Dulera inhaler and everything was great until mid-Feb. I woke up one day and it was back. Went to an asthma/allergy doc who gave me a CT scan of sinuses and chest - all normal and a spirometry test that showed moderate persistent asthma. Got allergy skin test and all allergens were negative. He gave me singulair and symbicort and it didn't help the SOB. In early march he put me on a 6 day taper of prednisone and then back to the dulera. It worked for about a week and a half and now the SOB is back. I don't know what to do. I am 33, good shape, smoked for about 10 years (off and on) in my 20's but quit four years ago. I don't have attacks ever. Just a constant nagging shortness of breath that gets worse with activity. Am I missing something? Is this normal for asthma? I have also had anxiety and gerd tossed around but I don't know... I am at my wits end with this. Any advice would be appreciated!
