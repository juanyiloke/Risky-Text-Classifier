  Things aren't so bad after all...I finally landed a job after being unemployed for the better part of a year. I suffer from depression and very low self esteem, on top of that anxiety disorder. I felt hopeless for a very long time, i isolated myself and pushed those away who loved me. Mostly out of shame of feeling like a loser and a deep self hatred of myself. I also came close to suicide when those bad thoughts overwhelmed me and i thought it was the only way out. One day i woke up and said to myself "your better than this!". If i can't pull myself out of this dark hole that I'm in it's going to kill me. I started to think positive instead of negative, and my future seemed a lot more bright instead of dark and gloomy. Any one whose reading this and feeling down i want you to know things will get better. You do have a future and could lead a productive life, you just have to make the effort. Start off small, take baby steps, and set goals for yourself. You could achieve anything you put your mind to, just stay confident in yourself. Also realize that life is what you make it, take the negative and turn it into a positive! I hope my post helps inspire those who are feeling down at the moment. If you want to contribute or have any questions for me I'd be glad to answer them.
