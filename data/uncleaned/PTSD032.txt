What Advice Would You Give To Your Young Adult Self?Or 15 year old self? Let me explain. This posting about wanting to be an adult https://www.myptsd.com/c/threads/as-i-child-i-longed-to-be-an-adult.50872/I suppose I didn't think through very well. A younger poster said that it didn't give them much hope. Yikes! Those were very different times. Judith Herman was a trailblazer and I didn't hear the term PTSD or trauma until decades after her work - no doctors put my somatic responses together with the possibility that I had been traumatized. Now there are many more resources available. Anyways, Herman draws a pretty bleak picture of how life looked for those of us in those times when we stepped out on our own. I believe it was pretty accurate for the times as so little was known about trauma. But what about now? If you knew then what you know now....had the resources the younger ones have now, would there be any advice that you would give to your (or our current) younger generation in dealing with these issues that come with PTSD? What do you wish someone could have told you that may have made the journey easier? Any ideas?
