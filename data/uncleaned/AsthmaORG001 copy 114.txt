completely fed up i need to rant about this but no one listens I'm totally fed up because the Drs are now saying that I only have very mild asthma and its all anxiety and something else and I can't breathe deeply coz it hurts and no one listens when I say I can't breathe so I stopped saying it and now they al think I'm fine all the time when in actual fact every breath is hard. I don't know if it is asthma or not but I just wish that they could tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. Its hard at school as everyone thinks they understand but they don't and I'm just so tired all the time from trying to breathe that I can't concentrate in lessons. If any one has any ideas they would be gratefully received.Sorry, moan over...
