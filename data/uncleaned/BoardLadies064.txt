Help with PMTSorry to gate crash the Ladies Lounge but I need help. My wife suffers from severe PMT, it is affecting our marriage, I dread that week and try to avoid spending time with her. Sometimes she can be violent. The rest of the month she is brilliant and we have a good time with one lovely child. I don't know how long I can keep going. Can anyone tell me what is the best way to help with these mood swings, I've asked my wife to look for help and I've explained how it is affecting me but she is reluctant. Help please
