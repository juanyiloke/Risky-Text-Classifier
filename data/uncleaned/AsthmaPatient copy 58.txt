Link between Crohns (azathioprine) - Ashtma - Hayfever (antihistamine pills)? I have been taking Azathioprine to treat my Crohns for about 3 years and I have reacted very well to it, my Crohns is well under control to a point whereby I wouldn't know I ever had it. I'm very fortunate.Whilst my Crohns has been cured by Azathioprine my Asthma has gradually got worse over the last 3 years. Given the timing I can only assume the Azathioprine has a part to play.During the summer months I suffer badly from Hayfever affecting my nose and eyes. My Asthma though remains as it usually is and does not worsen or improve dependant on season.However the past few weeks I've been taking Antihistamine / Hayfever pills and my Ashtma has drastically worsened.Whislt my Hayfever is under control my Ashtma isn't so as a test I stopped taking the Antihistamine / Hayfever pills 2 days ago and suddenly my shortness of breath has dissappeared. Not great for my Hayfever but at least I can breathe!Is this a coincidence or is it possible that due to being on Azathioprine my taking Antihistamines are reacting negatively and worsening my Asthma?
