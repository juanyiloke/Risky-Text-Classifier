**** this.Seriously, **** this. My eating disorder has stolen nearly half my life. I am currently overweight and miserable, but I have been underweight and miserable and a healthy weight and miserable. Looking back I can see the common factor is 'miserable'.I need my life to stop revolving around food. There is so much more.I am putting this here to I can hold myself accountable and to ask for some advice.ÊWhat are people's experiences of dietitians and meal plans? How do you stop yourself eating the weekly shop in one go? Are there any medications that help? I'd heard that fluoxetine is supposed to be good but I take that already.I know I need to come up with some healthier coping mechanisms/responses to aspects of my illness so suggestions would be really gratefully received.I know I'm not about much but I would really appreciate some input (even if it is just a kick up the backside).Um, ta for reading :)
