PSA up and down results after HT ends My PSA record showing how it can rise and fall once off HT.   to hopefully help those post HT in a similar position.HT ended Aug 2008The ups and downs were a puzzle. After July 2012 result I checked back on what I was doing pre PSA test, which from what I could recall was high workload (property refurb) and using heavy duty power tools. I put that to GP and we agreed I should refrain from such for a week rather than the norm of 3 days before PSA test. The result from Jan 2013 to now is pretty stable - I pass if that is co-incidence or not. Good luck to all Ray
