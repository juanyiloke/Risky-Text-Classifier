Ulcerative Colitis and DiabetesI was diagnosed type 2 last July and I have had ulcerative colitis nearly 30 years. I am currently having quite a bad colitis attack and all my tablets, and food, are passing straight through. I am now under 8 stone and still losing weight. Seen the doc and he has said that the steroids I usually have react with the diabetes and I would have to have insulin injections. I have no problem with this other than being really scared if my tablets continue to conflict. Is there anyone else out there with these two conditions that can put my mind at rest. Thank you.
