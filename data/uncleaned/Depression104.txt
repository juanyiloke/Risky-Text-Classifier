want to kill myself right now what do I do? Ive made a previous attempt and just got out of inpatient psychiatric hospital where I established I couldnt do it even if I wanted too. My flatmate just said im too emotional. Just confirmed what I already knew about myself that im weak and pathetic. I cant live with being this sort of person but I cant kill myself because I dont want her to feel guilty becaus she didnt mean to upset me was only speaking the truth.I have no crisis plan in place and its night time so i cant go to my gp. I cant speak to my flatmate because ill only be proving her point that i am too emotional. And i cant ring samaritans because she will hear me.I dont know what to do
