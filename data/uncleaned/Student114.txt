Unsure about Uniby Abby_W31Hi, Long story short, originally I wanted to be a Vet and my family really encouraged me to do that but then my grades weren't good enough at AS Level so I decided to go to Uni to become a Vet Nurse which you can then build on to become a full Vet. Having been to various interviews and looking at the courses some more online, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm making the right choice. Don't get me wrong, I have always wanted to work with animals and most probably always will, but, A- levels are stressing me out now and I just know that the VN Courses will be ten times worse due to the amount of time that must be spent away on placement. I think what my problem really is, is that I'm fed up of being in education, I want to get out into the world and explore and actually live, rather than being stuck in classrooms until I'm 20+! I've always fancied the idea of owning my own business to do with one of my hobbies- Animals, Writing, Cooking and Photography but I just don't have a clue where I would start as my A-levels are in Sciences and Maths.Does anyone have any, suggestions, words of support, similar experiences ETC?Thank you so much!
