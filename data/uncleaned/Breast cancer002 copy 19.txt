Arm/Shoulder Pain¥	Hello Everyone¥	I'm here looking for some support/advice as my partner recently diagnosed with stage 2 ductal carcinoma, with 1 lymph node...we have a plan in place and lumpectomy scheduled this Monday followed by chemo and rad. ¥	I don't need to add really how devastating the news has been as I have read many posts and it seems to be the same for everyone, its so exhausting!! ¥	My concern is that my partner keeps complaining about shoulder/arm pain? Has anyone with stage 2 had this problem pre operative and is it likely to be relative to the cancer? ¥	I have to say, i bow down to you ladies and i realise I'm a total wimp, after reading so many posts on here and just how very very brave you all are.
