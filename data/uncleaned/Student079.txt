Durham vs Warwick (especially postgrads and mature candidates)by BlueSnufkin...They both rank well in many categories. Some say Durham is prestigious and beautiful, but elitist and full of embittered Oxbridge-rejects; others say Warwick is ugly, boring and in Coventry, but has a great research environment.What say you?I have excellent and supportive supervisors, and full funding from both universities (for a PhD in Politics & IR). I'm an EU applicant and never studied in the UK before. I'm also a mature student (over 30's), and not so much into college party life, as much as I am into my various hobbies and passions, travels, a peaceful but creative lifestyle, art & culture, nature & greenery & and an intimate but dynamic social network. After living a nomadic lifestyle in various developing countries for years, I'm also aching for a quiet, modern and a comfortable home where to settle down for a few years.Research excellence and rankings? Reputation? Student satisfaction? Research/study environment? Working space, libraries, resources allocated to postgrad students? International opportunities? Flexibility? Flexibility in terms of part-time work or short-term assignments/consultancies abroad? Creativity? Art & culture? Accommodation options (especially outside the colleges/campus, for singles wanting to live alone)? Transport/proximity to transport hubs and airports?Pros and cons? Challenges or drawbacks I should prepare myself for?Which one would you choose?
