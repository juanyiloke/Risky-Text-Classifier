First Anniversary - not coping so well!Posted over a year agoOn Monday it will be a year since my motorcycle accident, I am still healing from the accident and the date feels like its looming over me like a giant storm cloud. I have been told I am suffering from Post Traumatic Stress and am finding it hard to remain positive and cope with the trauma, at this time. I find myself bursting into tears about nothing and don't really feel like eating or being around other people and have trouble sleeping. I should also mention that I am currently looking for work as I left my job and the city I was living in to return to stay with my parents, because the job I was in did not pay sick pay and I would not have been able to afford to keep my flat running while off work.Please give me some advice on how to cope, I've tried breathing exercises and I am keeping very busy preparing for interviews and looking for work, which only seems to make me worse!
