Long shot.New here and looking for some answers. I am a 47 yr old female was a smoker. My lung Dr has been watching a spot on my lung for a little over a year, recently had pneumonia, did chest x-ray, now Dr. Is concerned. This spot is growing, had a pet scan when spot was first found, Dr said it wasn't cancer, now he is saying pretty sure it is. Set to do another pet scan Monday really nervous. He said I have 3 choices,scope down throat, needle biopsy, or have spot removed. He is saying even if not cancer spot still needs to be removed. It is 3.6 x2.5 cm. I am terrified. Had breathing test and I only have 61% lung compacity. This waiting is the hardest. So does anyone have a clue what I am going to be facing? I am wondering if a spot that big can be removed laparoscopic or will I be opened up. How long will i be down . Any insight would really be great. Thanks in advance.
