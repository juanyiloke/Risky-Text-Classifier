Would I be a rebel if?As you all know I had a hip replacement at the end of July.  I have a HbA1C in November and reading from my meter my average BGs are 8.  I have been finding it difficult to keep everything under control (not yet really taking the 1500 Met).  That doesn't mean I have been totally off the straight and narrow - I haven't.  One good reason why I can't is that my stomach reacts in its normal way if I either eat something I can't ( like spicey food, curries etc) or eat too much, and its just not worth it.  Do you reckon my recovery time from the hip replacement might be responsible or am I just trying to cod myself!  I have no intentions of going for a HBa1c that's going to bring on the wrath of the medics.  I will certainly go for the cholesterol test.  Hope it will show the usual good cholesterol despite the (non lipid profile) test I had in May.By the way my husband and I watched the 5 Foods you must not eat (hangs around on t'net all the time) and I have never paid much attention.  Well quel surprise (practicisng for Paris LOL).  It was actually quite reasonable and seemed to be based on bgs and insulin and low carbs and the word diabetes didn't appear once.  Could be worth a look just for interest.  BTW of course the sting in the tail is the you need to join the Trim Down Club - but at a one payment of £37 I would do it myself for the wealth of sense I read.  Unless you think different..................................
