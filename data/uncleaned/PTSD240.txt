How to recover from wrestling with call centersby perstam » Fri Nov 07, 2014 12:39 pmI'm delighted that I was able to get a good, affordable health insurance policy *mod edit* last year, but *mod edit* (the company I chose) refuses to process claims correctly.Dealing with call center people is like dealing with emotional vampires! I was on the phone 1.5 hours yesterday. I'm still reeling from that awful experience. It seems like the fat cats who create call centers hire high-school dropouts who cannot understand plain English. I never get a straight answer and I get mixed answers.I've read Emotional Blackmail and have started reading Emotional Vampires. Neither address this problem of dealing with call centers. How can I deal with them without succumbing to FOG??Please do not post strategies to use during a call to a call center. I've tried most of them. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. What I'm looking for is how to recover my sanity after the call ends.
