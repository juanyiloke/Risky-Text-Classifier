ÊDiarrhea whenever I have to take an exam or feel nervous?For several years, whenever I have to take any exam or be in a nervous state of mind, I feel extremely nervous and anxious. The real problem is that this causes me to have a 'flight or fight' response and I suffer from stomach pains, bloating and often diarrhea. This has caused me to not do well in tests I have studied loads for because I have to go to the toilet. I know people might refer to this as 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome' but this is not so as I only have these symptoms when I feel nervous. I also have tried telling myself there is nothing to worry but the symptoms still appear. I am quite worried as important exams are approaching. Any advice on how to manage this anxiety?
