Êwill I ever get betterive suffered from PTSD for a few years now down to a relationship that went on for 6 years, i was raped, abused mentally and physically and i was controlled. that relationship ended 5 years ago but i still get the symptoms of PTSD, Im in art therapy and have been for 1 year,the thing is, i started a relationship with a man about 4 months ago i have known for 15 years and we have always been close friends. now we are together he has changed, hes gone from laid back to being obssesive with me. wanting to know everything, why some of my plans dont involve him and im finding it hard. i know he wouldnt hurt me physically but its causing me stress. I honeslty avoid him because i cant deal with him wanting constant attention and wanting to hug and message me everyday minute of the day,is this normal when starting a new relationship? this is how my last one started and it scares the hell out of me, ive spoken to him time and time again about this but its not going into his head, he tells me he latches on to things he likes but this is a bit much for methank you so much in advance
