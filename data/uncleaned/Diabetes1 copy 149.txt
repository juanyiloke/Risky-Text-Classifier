going from type 2 to type 1 i think....questions i cannot answerHi All, i have been type 2 for 5 years, 2 years ago i had a flair up january time where my levels went haywire.after several months of changing my tablets they finally settled it down. now 2 years on again in january i have gone out of wack again. my levels keep going up as high as 20 after eating.i have increasing pains that keep coming around my right kidney. after eating lunch time i am getting symptoms like my heart is pounding out of my chest and up my neck....thumping head. when these happen i can see my sugar levels go up to 16 then after around 3 hours dropp back down to 7 where i start to feel better again.my long term health nurse wants to put me on injections but the doctors at the hospital are twiddling there thumbs over giving the go ahead....my doctor is changing my tablets again in the hope it will correct.....the diabetic nurse seems to think that my levels are too low to cause these pain symptoms and heart that feels like it is working overtime. my doctor thinks the diabetes might be affecting my nervouse system causeing what he calls signal misfires ...i am totally lost at the moment. i know last night i went to bed on a reading of 20.4 and got up with a reading of 17.0 and felt like my heart was in my through ....my HBA1C is 98 it should be 48....and they still seem stunned i am having problems with my readings they claim you dont feel ill with readings from 12 to 20 ....i am looking for helpful info from people who actually suffer the disease and not the doctors... nowthanks Gary.
