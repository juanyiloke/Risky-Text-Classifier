New results - very happy!At the end of August I received a letter from the nurse at the GPs telling me my annual review was due.  Was happy with this because although I see the Endo/pump DSN, my next appointment is 3 May next year.  Plus they don't do the foot testing etc and the nurse at the GPs does.Knowing I was going on holiday I prudently arranged for bloods to be done just before I went.  However today was the first appointment available that I could attend, having got home.  Sooo... Hba1c 41 or 5.9 in old money.  She mentioned that there was a letter from the Endo saying he didn't want me under 6.4 as I was having hypos, but as I pointed out, I wasn't having hypos to achieve that result.  I'd really worked hard to adjust my basals so iron them out.  Of course, I had quite a few on holiday, due to the heat and lots of walking, but that was after the test, and I'd done what I could with temp basals and lowering permanent basal rates.
