HELP!!Hey guys!!I've suffered from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and overeating disorder since i was around 8 years old, and I am now 20.I am so sick and tired of stressing constantly about my physical appearance and food!! I just want to be happy, but unfortunately I am a big girl and this makes me really upset. I was bullied horribly in school about my weight, and this is what lead to my eating disorder.I have periods of time where i am either anorexic, bulimic or overeating dramatically. I've tried to see dietitians/nutritionists but they didn't help me at all.I don't know where to start with recovery...can anyone point me in the right direction???? I've just come out of a massive binge period and am very overweight. I know my behaviors are not healthy.Thanks for reading this! I hope to hear from you!!
