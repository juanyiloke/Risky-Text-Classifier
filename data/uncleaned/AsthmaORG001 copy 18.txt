Not sure if I have problem or not Intermittant spasms of coughing (severe) lasting several minutes I have, in recent weeks had some really bad coughing fits, which leave me exhausted.I was diagnosed with mild asthma two years ago and prescribed a relieving inhaler.I have had no follow up. I have used the inhaler for tight chest symptoms and a general feeling of struggling to get breathoccasionally since then. Recently, I have had spasms of coughing during the day only, which prevent me from speakingand are bad enough to hurt my throat and leave me exhausted, needing to sit for a while to recover.I do not know if this is asthma related or just perhaps a virus. This has been happening intermittently for several weeks.Domestic sprays make me cough, but these spasm seem unconnected to my environment. They sometimes happen if I talk to muchon the phone. I have a persistent itching in my windpipe when I breathe out.Is anyone familiar with this situation, or can offer advice please. I don't want to take up my Drs time with something trivial or transient.
