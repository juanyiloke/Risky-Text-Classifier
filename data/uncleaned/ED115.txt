Rock BottomSo I'm not too sure where to start this... I have suffered from an ED since I was 12 year old, I'm now 23. Cycling through bouts of sever restriction, bingeing, purging, over exercising... needless to say I've hit them all. I've never had a 'normal' relationship with food and never felt what's it like to be happy or healthy. However this past year has been the worst for me by far. It's safe to say I've hit rock bottom.Recently my parents found out about my ED and are encouraging me to recover. The amount of love and support I've received from them is overwhelming, especially when my eating problems are something I've kept a secret for so long.I really do want to get better. Not only for myself, but for them. I want to feel what it's like to be healthy. That being said.. I'm terrified also. Every ounce of my being wants to recede back into my shell of my eating problems.I would love to hear from someone who got through this. Recovered and came out the other end. How do you fight the urge to revert back to old ways when it's so deeply seeded in who you are? Did you gain a ton of weight from eating more?It's all so scary.
