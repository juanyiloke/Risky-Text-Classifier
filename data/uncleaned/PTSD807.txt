ÊPeople talking weird HELPDiagnosis of ptsd usually cripples me with anxiety to the degree I don't go out. Staying at home curbs my hypervalence to a bearable level. Had to go to chemist for meds today and thought everyone was talking different languages ( they weren't) told the girl at the til that I don't speak Spanish then realised she was speaking English. Same thing happening in the shop next door. I have had some visual hallucinations, or as I call them changes in my visual perception due to flashbacks but this freaked me out. Anyone else had similar, really do t want to go out again and is triggering dark thoughts and self injury. Scared I'm going psychotic. Help
