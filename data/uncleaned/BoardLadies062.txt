Mooncup problemsHi all. I bought one of these two cycles ago, as I am over 35 size A was recommended so I got it. First couple of times it wasn't too bad, I trimmed the stem as advised on the instructions to suit where it sits inside. The first couple of times removing it was fine. However I slept with it in last night and it had obviously worked it's way further in so I had a much harder time finding it to remove it this morning and same after a day at work today.I also got cramps in my abdominal area today like a stitch on my left side. I removed it after trying to locate the stem which was very hard to find without much squatting and bearing down on it, still have the cramps though. Not seeking medical advice, just wondering if anyone else who uses it had any problems like this? I am disappointed as I am getting too worried to try again, it's bad enough practically having to send a search party up your lady lane to remove it, but the cramps are telling me it's not a good idea at all for me. Any experiences anyone can share would be helpful, thanks.
