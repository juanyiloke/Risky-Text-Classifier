Êbulimia questionAlright, I have struggled with bulimia for about 12 years now, I get a little better and then I fall again. My husband and I are looking to buy a new house and I am nervous because I still purge once in a while and the house we are looking at has a septic system. I have never lived anywhere with a septic system before and I am afraid my bulimia would cause huge problems. Does anyone know if it can? Has anyone ever lived in a home with a septic system and struggled with bulimia? Most of the houses in the country have septic systems, and we want to live in the country. Should we not consider buying a house until I recover? I'm afraid I never will =(
