Hate everything.Why fucking bother? I've never had a girlfriend, have no future, I just take up space. I'm just going to mooch off my family until I die alone and bitter. Sure, jumping off the bridge would hurt them at first, but it'd be kinder in the long run.ÊI never expected to make it to twenty, and maybe I should have become a fortune teller, because it certainly seems that way. The world is a terrible fucking place, I hate everyone and everything, I wish we'd get it over with and just nuke each other already. Excuse the crassness of it, but it's time to "shit or get off the pot" humanity. The majority of you don't deserve what you have, most of you are human cockroaches, and the rest are too fucking stupid to understand what the hell is going on.ÊFuck it. I'm just going to get shitfaced, and stumble off a bridge. Can't wait for everyone at school to pretend they gave a fuck for a whole three days before they forget I ever existed.
