  An UpdateHeyJust thought I'd give a quick  update  on my recovery.I am about to start two new  voluntary places in mental health . The first role is Mental Health Support Worker and the second one is a Befriender in a cafe in a day centre.Made some new friends and beengoing out  more then I used too now. My medication has been reduced to taking onetablet  every two days. I feel motivated and positive about myself. Now finally feel in control over my life . As for Jason, still haven't heard from him. He hasn't changed his number. But I am still making contact like sending a letter once a month. I am going to keep the door open at all times.Once new things start happening like when I start work , I'll update you all.
