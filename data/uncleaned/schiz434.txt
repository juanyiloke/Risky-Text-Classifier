ÊSchizophrenia questionSo I have to go to see more doctors on Tuesday and I am scared that they will tell me I am schizophrenic, I looked up all the symptoms and read the WHO guidelines and everything and I think they are going to diagnose me with it so that they can just give me more tablets...How do they diagnose it in a meeting, like could I just pretend to be normal for an hour and get away with it...that's what I normally do but this time it is with special psychiatrists. can I just say no when they ask about the voices and visions? I don't want them to be able to give me tablets that are dangerous, they already force me to go to the meetings. I don't want them to hurt me :'(
