Saying hello.... Just wanted to post to say Hello!!!I used to be on these boards and quite active in the forum for a while but then was having a lot of problems with my asthma and went into a sort of denial and didnt want to be on the forums or anything.My asthma is still totally out of control but I have a good team who I am working with to try and get everything under control so I have my fingers crossed. I can only work part time in my job and have had to move roles a lot because of my asthma. I am a renal nurse and used to work on the wards but now am a community dialysis nurse looking after patients who dialyse in their own home. I love this role as it is giving our patients as much independence as possible and really promotes them to self manage their condition.Since working part time I have had some fantastic opportunities land at my feet which fill up my time. I am involved in Public and Patient Involvement in the Asthma UK Centre of Applied Research which I love doing. I have met some of the leading respiratory Drs not only in the UK but in the world. What I do in the centre is read research proposals, lay summaries and part of Patient Advisory Groups for different pieces of research that is going on.So with the experiences I have had with the centre and my own personal experiences of being in and out of hospital I wanted to come back into the forum to be able to help if I can people who are struggling with their asthma and offer any advice I can!! I look forward to chatting and helping in any way I can!!!
