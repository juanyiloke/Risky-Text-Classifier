Worried sick.by oliviamalonaI am a student from the US coming to the UK for one year to complete my masters. I had it narrowed down to Kent and Sheffield and upon student advice on tsr I chose Sheffield. I'm now worried sick. I know Shwffield has the better program, but I am really looking for the experience, (my major is medieval and early modern history) and it seems there isn't much traditional history left in sheffield. I was confident but after looking at photos of sheffield and of the unis I passed up (Exeter, durham, kent) im feeling sick! Will I find history in Sheffield or should I beg Durham or Exeter to take me back!?
