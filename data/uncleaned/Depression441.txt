Dealing With Mood Swings.Ê  Nisemono ,Ê02 May 2015So sometimes I think that I'm worthless, life is worthless, people are terrible, everyone hates me, everything is shit and so on. I'm never exactly bursting with positivity but when I'm not at my lowest I think that such thoughts are a little excessive. But it's always real and true when I feel like that, and the idea that it isn't can seem naive and delusional. The way I see myself and the world changes all the time and I don't know what to believe. I hate people, or is that just a defence mechanism which stops me from feeling desperately lonely? People are boring and stupid. No I'm boring and stupid! Either way I'm better off alone. No, being alone is terrible. Hell is other people but being alone is also hell. I want to be a good person and I want to feel loved but I see through morality and love and both seem worthless. Damn it what point was I trying to make? The way things seem when I'm at my lowest, maybe that's the truth. Or maybe it's complete bullshit. I don't know but I wish I could decide on one or the other.
