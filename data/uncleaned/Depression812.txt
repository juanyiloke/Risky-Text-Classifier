No purposeHi I Feel like i have no purpose in life at alli have 2 casual jobs but only work about 10 hours a week and spend the restof my time at home. I live by myself so i dont have anyone really to talk toi have no friends and speak to very few of my family members and the ones i do speak to live in another state so i dont even see them.Everyday is the same I wake up and stay in bed on the computerI have dreams i suppose but they never last long, going back to school, learning languages, Losing weight etc but i start them with full intentions of sticking to them but lose interest a few days later.I live in a small town which doesnt have a whole lot available when it comes to classes and activities all the things i mentioned above are online which makes it harder.I have plenty of support from professionals i have a social worker a psychologist but they have pretty much done all they can for me i know i need to help myself I'm just not sure what step to take next.If anyone can give me any advice on what i could possibly do that would be awesome, I dont think i can continue to live my life this way it feels like a waste. Thank you, Melissa
