Homebase? Whats the pointMy Christmas tree lights decided to give up the ghost yesterday, so this morning I take a drive to Homebase.I was gobsmacked. Where the usual hug Christmas tree and stuff usually is was replaced with BBQ' and summer garden furniture, and the Christmas stuff was relegate to a teeny corner of the store. I took a verbal pop at the manager then had to go to the local Garden center and pay £27 for LED lights.Homebase can shove it now, I'll drive further and use B&Q
