Moving ForwardHi everyone . I am going through a lot of good stuff and bad stuff and there are a lot of changes .First off , My girlfriend and I ended our relationship after lasting 4 years . This year we started to see each other on different paths , and because oour views on each other changed . We decided it was time to end it.On top of that , my sister and I are no longer really talking due to I don't feel anything towards her , and because I recently experienced a flashback from my childhood where she was involved .Aside from that , I have noticed that in my day to day life , a lot of my old activities don't really hold my attention much ; not really sure why Does anyone have had similiar experiences to this ?On a positive note , I am really starting to be more productive with my guitar practice during the week in the mornings .My workman arts classes are going ok , and I recently rejoined my music club and will be playing once a month at a seniors home not far from where I live .
