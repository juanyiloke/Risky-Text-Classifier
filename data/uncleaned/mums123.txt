I have a 10 week old who has a good night routine but daytimes are all over the place. suits me fine but I'm starting to wonder about naps as he loves to sleep on me and therefore doesn't sleep for very long at a time. we have a moses basket downstairs which he still fits into but it won't be long, I'm sure, until it's too small.ÊWe need to get a travel cot for when we go away. I was thinking of having the travel cot at the back of the lounge downstairs so we can also use the changing table bit of it downstairs. is this a bad idea for him to use for naps? should he be going up to bed when he has a routine? should I stick with the moses basket for now?Êreally unsure of what to do as I don't want to get him used to sleeping in something if I'll be making a rod for my own back when it comes to proper nap times.
