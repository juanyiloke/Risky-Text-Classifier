  Really confusedI am a 59 year old male that a little over a month ago was diagnosed with early NSC Lung cancer in my upper left lung. About three weeks ago I had the upper left lobe of my lung removed. I am actually doing pretty well as far as recovery goes.Two of my doctors recommended that I receive chemo after the surgery and actually set up the appointment for me. I went to see the Oncologist and was told by him that I have a 50% chance that the surgery cured me and that he does not treat people who have a 50% chance or better of being cured. Is this normal? I can’t believe he expects me to just sit and wait to see what happens. Over the last five years I have lost two younger brothers and a first cousin to NSC lung cancer and I am supposed to just trust that this guy has my best interest at heart.I would appreciate anyone’s thoughts or recommendations on this.
