  Why I love my life and my selfI went from something to nothing back to something and heading to everything. Man of the house at 15, on my own in college at 18, survived long unemployment stretches using my creativity, re took classes I failed SOMETIMES TWICE, made connections, lost connections, lost friends, lost my mind, broke bones, broken heart, mended the pieces of my fucked up life and came right back, the most gangsta person with a college degree and a great  position in a great FORTUNE 500 corporation. I went from the loser to the winner to the loser back to the winner again and again. Only woman who ever cared for me through thick and thin  was my mom and only man who cared for me through thick and thin was the man in the mirror. Dam near was ready to kill myself before I joined the community, I didnt know which way to go, felt like I wasted years and precious time on bullshit.I said all that say I am here, Im alive, better than ever and this is just the beginning of life in the way I want to live it. That is the biggest success I can think of ever that Ive completed yet. Im 25 with the soul and wisdom of a 40 year old but with a vigor of a baby kicking its way out of his moms wound . Thank you everyone here for staying with me as i moaned and bitched, critiqued my poetry, and found inspiration  in the inspiration thread before it got taken down.IF YOU DID NOT READ  ALL THAT READ THIS: NEVER STOP FIGHTINGBecause there isnt a dam thang worth having if you did not have to fight and struggle to get it. I love you if you read it all. Have a good night/day/ whatever :).-WBL
