What have YOU done for recovery today?In my ED recovery it’s been useful for me to each day write down what I have done in moving forward in recovery that day. Something (or even several something’s!) each day! What this does is it allows me to focus on my progress instead of the things I perhaps didn’t do so well at.So i invite you all to start doing this with me. I think it would be healthiest if we didn’t include numbers, or specific foods and though this may sound like it limits what you can post I promise it does.For example there is no need to say ‘I ate X amount of calories’ or ‘I had <specific food> for breakfast’ but rather it would be healthier for us to post things like ‘I ate a healthy amount today’ or ‘I ate out with a friend’ or ‘I found out my weight is back in a healthy bracket’. it would even be great if it wasnt food, weight or anything of the sort related such as... ‘I wore a pretty dress that made me feel GORGEOUS’ or ‘I really worked hard in therapy’.Ok are we getting the idea?OK get set - GO
