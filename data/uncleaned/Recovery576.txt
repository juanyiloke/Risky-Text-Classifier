  The sun, and the yard, and the birdsAfter solong  of darkness, I can see again.I see the sun when it shines,I see the flowers, and even planted some,This week I discovered a pair of robins made a nest in our yard.Yesterday I saw my first ever bluejay. I wake up sometimes ready to face the day. And while the clouds blur my vision , it is never so dark  for so long. I still have to take naps, I still have panic attacks  when I get overwhelmed, but having good in my life helps , and going outside every day  helps. Having a job where I am appreciated helps. I don't come around here much, internet connection not as easy , but I do think about all of you and hope that you find  your way out as well.
