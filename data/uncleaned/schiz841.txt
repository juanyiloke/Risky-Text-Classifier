Someone I know has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I just wanted to know if LYING is part of his condition. I don't know if I should be angry at him. He is aware of the lies. The only time I suspect he is unaware of the lying is when he goes off on his paranoid delusions. But that I can understand. But what about lying for everything else. His motivation I guess about lying is to make him self feel better when in depression. But the lies are not exactly fully in touch with reality. But in any case I think he knows he is lying. Part of his schizophrenia or is he a bad person who likes to deceive people. His lies hurt people. He seems to enjoy it. I would like to understand before I pass judgment on an old friend that I apparently really never knew because his life was all lies. What I do know is that he has Paranoid Schizophrenia and Depression. Does he have control over his lying?
