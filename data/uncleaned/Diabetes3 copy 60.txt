Low PlateletsWhilst on holiday last week I woke up one morning to my eye having what looked like a big bubble of blood in the lower half. A couple of hours later the 'bubble' burst and the lower half of my eye, up to the iris, was full of blood. I didn't do anything about it and it has since resolved itself but am not sure whether to mention this to the gp. I just feel like I'm there all the time at the moment and don't want to bother her again! I am also unable to stomach the ascorbic acid tablets that I supposed to take twice a day for a month.
