ÊIs it too late?Hi, I am 53 and was recently diagnosed with BPD. I didn't like the diagnosis but now I'm wondering if it really matters because I think I have come to a point in my life that I feel I am too old to bother to do anything about it. I am not sure if Borderline is even the correct diagnosis but I would certainly meet some of the criteria for it. I am no longer involved with the outside world and only leave the house once a week. This way of life has given me peace of mind and my anxiety has lessened greatly. My life to this point has been a trainwreck and I know (and have been told) that 'everyone' knows I'm crazy. I can clearly see why people would think that but feel now like I could not care less. I don't know how much longer I will live......it could be another 20 or 30 years and I wonder sometimes, that if this is the case, can I remain isolated from the rest of the world and be ok about it? I'm waiting to see a Psychologist but not sure if there's much point(though I will go). I would be grateful for some of your thoughts. Am I too old to change? Am I just weary from a life on 'high alert'? Thank you, if you have read this.
