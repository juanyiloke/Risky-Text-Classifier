Cashing out a 401k2014-05-02, 07:05 AMSo I know that when you cash out a 401k early, in addition to having to pay taxes on the money you take out there is a penalty (10% I believe). My question is about the tax: do you pay that immediately (i.e. does it come out of the money you cash out) or does it just figure in when you are doing your regular taxes at the first of the year?For example, say I cash out $10,000. Will I receive:a) $9,000, then have that count as income and owe more than I normally would when I do my taxes in January, orb) $7,500 or so, and that's the end of it
