  Kids on Flovent________________________________________Dr just put kids on Flovent. They have had asthma for years but never prescribed anything other than albuterol and oral steroids. The last 4years have been hell, consistent hospital visits, flare up, nose bleeds, pneumonia, strep throat, ear infections. They have "been sick" almost their whole lives.I always thought their asthma wasn't that bad because they never had asthma attacks. Now I'm researching Flovent and it definitely sounds like something they both need but I'm also seeing those reviews about the negative side effects. Its scary to me. Is this stuff bad? Also Dr prescribed for vent for daily use, albuterol every 4 hours and this mystery inhaler of "proventil" that does doc never mentioned. Flovent daily and proventil for a few days when you are having a flare up? Is that correct.?To start with I don't have COPD or Emphysema...but I do have Asthma and after 44 years of barking (yeah my cough sounds like a cross between a large barking dog and a person dying of lung cancer) and having phnemonia or bronchitis 3 or 4 times per year I finally got put on a drug/puffer that makes me breath like normal person. I've been like this (asthma )since I was 3 months old, and after spending the last 10 years believing that I was going to die of either a major asthma attackor phnemonia....I finally feel like a normal asthma free human being. It's been 3 months now since my new asthma doc put me on Spiriva. And I feel like a new woman. Nothing ever worked for me...and TODAY I had my 3 month check up and my lung function was 100%!!!!!!!! That's 100% normal function.... Working at 100% capacity!!!! Seriously if you have asthma and nothing is helping it ask your doctor for Spiriva. The only side effect I've had is a dry mouth occasionally... I'm not exaggerating I feel like I've been given a new lease on life...I've only used my ventolin maybe 10 times in the last three months…and before I was using about one puffer every 3 weeks or less. My lung doctor says it's not normally used for asthma but every once in a while it does the trick...and I was one of the lucky ones
