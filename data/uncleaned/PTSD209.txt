My mind is confusedby daisychain23 » Wed Jan 29, 2014 9:28 pmI have been attacked 4 times in my life time either sexual abuse, assault or rape and the most recent was about 15 months ago.One evening I was having a drink as this was on my head and I became upset and when I was drunk I told my friend what had happened. She called the police and I then became quite angry and ended up getting arrested and was taken to a police station where they pulled off my clothing. All I can recall is feeling like I was being attacked again and shouting them to stop. I now have flashbacks of it as it felt like I was attacked again and the thought of them touching me and seeing my naked body stays in my mind all day. I feel like I was attacked again and I do not know how to get over it. I now feel very wary of the police and cant understand how I get over this.
