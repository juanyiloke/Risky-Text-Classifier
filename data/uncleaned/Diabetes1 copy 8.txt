Iron DeficiencyHi Everyone. Have been a member for some while but have never posted before. I went to the doctor's yesterday for blood test results and he seemed quite concerned because after three months of taking iron tablets for iron deficiency my iron count had not just gone up but had fallen even further, which he says is impossible. Looking back through my records he said that my iron levels had not been right since 2005 (the year when I was diagnosed with T2). Has anyone ever heard of iron deficiency being linked to medication such as Metformin? I have read that B12 deficiency can be related to long term Metformin use, and I also have to have B12 injections every three months, but the doctor says there is no correlation between Metformin and iron deficiency. Can any one help or point me in the direction of articles/research?
