struggling.I suffer from Panic attacks, GAD, PTSD, OCD and Depression. The past few   I have suffered from breathlessness, my stress levels have been through the roof as well, its really starting too freak me out, I haven't been sleeping properly and my appetite is quite poor at the moment. I feel lightheaded, my heart starts to pound really hard and my throat feels like its about to close up, and have been really fatigued. Is it possible for all these things to make you so ill, 24/7? I see a councillor once a week, and I'm not on medication. I've been under a lot if pressure lately and am struggling quite a bit on how to deal with this right now, its like I take 1step forward and 2 steps back. Anyone else on here have similar experience?
