mobile phone in carsI read today yet another serious accident by somebody using a mobile phone when driving, this time a pensioner was killed.Bearing in mind that countless surveys have found that the practice of using a mobile this way is at least 3 times more dangerous than drink driving, If I were caught drunk in charge ( which I would not be ) I would immediately lose my licence.ÊWhen will the penny drop with politicians etc, and wake up from their constant slumber to create an immediate diving ban for anyone caught using a mobile when driving, I think this might reduce the vast number of people flagrantly ignoring the law in this way
