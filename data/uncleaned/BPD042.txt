The need for attentionby kah80 » Sun May 31, 2015 5:05 pmMy need for attention practically all the time is one of my biggest issues. I need to be in contact with people constantly to feel valid. Otherwise I just feel empty. My friend at work is very good and throughout the day we email each other at work and text each other in the evening. However he's away this week and I'm trying not to bother him. The other friend I talk to is also away and I sent him a message but he hasn't replied. So I texted another friend a couple of hours ago, but I've had no response. Coming on here helps, but if I post and no one replies then that gets to me too. Stupid thing is my fiancée is here, but I'm in another room cooking and I feel ignored. I need to be talking about my problems or I feel like no one is caring. Does anyone know a good way to deal with these feelings? And do other people here have this problem?
