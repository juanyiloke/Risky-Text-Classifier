All my life, I've gotten into a lot of car accidents and survived them all and never harmed anyone and was very, very blessed. No one ever felt comfortable as a passenger in my car and I always thought they were being rude. But, recently, I got into a a very bad one-car accident, and came out unscathed,(again), and now I feel that it is time for me to quit driving after a 40 year driving career. I am very adamant about this, because I got into this last accident because I was very stressed out from being very lost in my own hometown and very, very confused. I couldn't answer the officer's simple question's. I just feel it is time to give up my keys.
