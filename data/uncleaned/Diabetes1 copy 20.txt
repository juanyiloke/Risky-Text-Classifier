Need advice pleaseHi All,A bit of advice please if i may.......... My mother has type 2 but keeps getting Hypo's in the morning? About 2 - 3 per week . She will have porridge for breakfast and then have her main meal for LUNCH . My question is , should she have main meal n the evening rather than lets say a sandwich ?I believe her main source of a meal is too long till the next day. Yes she checks her results but they are not high when she goes to bed?Hope this makes sense as im a little worried and her Doc says this is ok and normalPlease HelpDenny
