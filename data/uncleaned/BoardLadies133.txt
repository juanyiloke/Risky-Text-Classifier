Are you confident?I've been thinking about this for the last while. I would have considered myself a confident person in that I don't mind speaking in front of a crowd, or introducing myself to new people etc. But, underneath all that...I don't know. I never feel like my performance at work is good enough. That's despite knowing my boss is happy with my work (she's said so!), and I get on extremely well with my coworker and we often work together on solutions to any issues. I still feel like I'm not doing well. My boyfriend can't understand this and says I need to have confidence in my own abilities. In social situations, while I may chat away to people.. I can be very sensitive to things I perceive to be me slipping up and saying the wrong thing, appearing boring etc. Again, I've expressed this worry to my OH and he's said he doesn't know how anyone could find me boring!Obviously there's many layers to it. You look at people in some situations and think "wow, they have such confidence in themselves. I'd love to be like that" and then you watch them being asked to speak in front of a crowd or something and they cower. Some people are extremely confident in their work, but find social situations uncomfortable. My confidence has definitely improved since I was a teenager and would barely speak (I'm 24 now)So, what does it mean to be confident? Are you confident? I've found pretending to be confident can work wonders in certain situations - especially social ones where you meet new people. Maybe the more you pretend, the more it become part of you!Ê
