Sudden low blood sugarHiHad a scary experience today! We were all heading out for a walk today and my son, who was diagnosed 7weeks ago, was in great form. 5 minutes into the walk he asked to stop and take his bloods. We did and they were 1.0, we always bring some sugar but thankfully had just been to the chemist and had stocked up on glucose tablets and gsf-syrup. I gave him a sachet of syrup and glucose tablets, 15 minutes later his bloods were 3.8 so gave him another tablet, 10 minutes later they were down again t 3.7 so another tablet. Finally they went up to 5 and I gave him a cereal bar. At the start I tried to call my husband who had walked on, but as were were in the forest I had no signal. He did come back when he spotted we weren't behind him,My son had a really good breakfast before leaving. This diabetes lark certainly keeps you on your toes. Once you think you have it, it throws a curve ball. I think it came on very quick as my son has been very good in picking up on low blood sugar. He said he felt like he was under water and everything I was saying was getting harder to understand. Scary day.
