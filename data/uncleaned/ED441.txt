ÊNew here - not sure I should be!Hi. I'm not sure I should be posting here or not. Don't really know if I have a problem. I had bulimia for about 9 years and have been more or less fine for about 12 years. Lately I have found myself obsessing again. I weigh myself several times a day. I think constantly about food and calorie count or point everything. I am back to not eating in public and feeling if I am seen eating people will b thinking no wonder she is so fat. The number on the scales determines my mood for the day. Am I heading for a relapse? I really don't think I would ever make myself sick again but I hate that the other stuff is rearing its head. I have a .GP appt coming up for somethingdifferent and don't know whether to mention this or not.
