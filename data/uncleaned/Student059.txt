Should I stay at university?by TMFleurSo, I've been at University now since September and I can't remember a whole week where I haven't cried in my room or been genuinely happy for the whole time. At first I thought it was just homesickness but shouldn't that have gone away after the first few months?I moved into a flat with my best friend at the time but since then we've grown apart and hardly spend time together. I've been going though some family issues and found myself just wanting to be by myself, besides I haven't felt like he's genuinely cared about me since before we started university together and I feel used because he only makes the effort to talk to me when he's bored or has no one else to talk to. I made friends with others in the flat but I'm sensitive and shy around them then I should be because I know some of them bitch about some of the others behind their back and feel like they do that to me and whenever I do socialize with them all I always end up being the pun of a joke or that they take the piss out of me.I've made a few friends on the course but the course I take involves a lot of the type of people who bitch about others as well and it's not something I deal well with since I'm not very quick witted and over sensitive. I enjoy my course but I wouldn't say I'm enthusiastic about it and would much rather be working or looking into other courses. Next year the course looks more interesting but I'm wondering if I'm just hoping that it is because of how unhappy I've been this year. I'll also be living in a studio next year and feel like I have my own space that I can keep clean which has been an issue in my communal areas this year.If I did leave I'm scared about all the money I'll have to pay back for a year and also about how others and my family will view me. I need to do whats best for me but I just don't know what is.
