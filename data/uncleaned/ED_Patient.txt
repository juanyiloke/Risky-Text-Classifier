My mum is taking me to the doctors for an eating disorder?My mum is taking me to the doctors for an 'eating disorder'. I do skip meals and try to eat as little calories as possible but the thing is, I put loads of weight on during exams. This summer I started trying to loose it and now she is going too far saying it's an eating disorder. Now I'm embarrassed because I'm around 5'4/5 and I weigh about 8 stone. I look a bit chubby in all honesty, and sometimes I binge. Other days I starve or eat as little as possible. I have tried to make myself sick but it doesn't usually work. I don't really know what they will do because by no means am I underweight or in any danger, I'm clinically a healthy weight, my BMI is healthy, I don't abuse laxatives etc. it's not a proper eating disorder, other people truly suffer. I'm embarrassed to get help. What will they do?
