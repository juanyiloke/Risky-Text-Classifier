Should he call company re interview?________________________________________HiMy OH had an interview with a company middle of last week. He heard about the role through someone he worked with previously - who in turn passed on the CV.Interview was last week - and they told him they would be back in touch early this week...He knows there were 3 in for the role....but feels he did a good interview. When is appropriate to follow up with the company on this job? His friend has no part in the process, other than forwarding the CV - so he wont have any detail...Is it ok to follow up if you hear nothing after X number of days? Its a job in a company he really wants....Thanks
