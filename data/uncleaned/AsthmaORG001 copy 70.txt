Asthma without wheezing or O2 levels dropping Daughters stats don't drop [+1] My daughter, who is 16 years old, was diagnosed with severe asthma two years ago. SHe has been controlled for the last 7 months using advair. Howeer when she has a cevere attack he stats dont drop and she doesn't wheeze. Her air movement just becaomes extremely diminished. My problem is that orten doctors don't believe her because of this. I can see she is in severe distress because she can't complete a sentence. her breathing becomes rapid and shallow, and she has extreme tightness in the lower part of her chest. TShe was released from the hspital yesterday after a 3 day stay and the doctor who released he would not presrcibe any steroids because he would not believe that it is asthma. He suggested vcd but she never is hoarse, never wheezes, can talk through attacks, and never feels like herupper airway is constricted. How do I get doctors to listen to us when she is having a severe attack<
