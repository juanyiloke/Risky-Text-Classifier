Friends!I couldn't depart PF without speaking to some of my old friends, I can't remember the registration date but it does number years. SO I don't intend to lift anchor.  I have apologised to our Site Owner Chris for my ill chosen words caused by irritation, I should know better at my age   Thanks due -  I felt a valued friend to some of my fellow forumers, anyway I would miss the old owl (xetog  ) and how could I not view the departure of CC...when he migrates.  Do you think he has joined the pilots in Papua? Sorry girls but to coin C68 words for men "Fella's"I would miss them...don't have one of my own! Goes without saying some of us would be real gossips together I wish it were possible sometimes  Up the Tigers TTTH   we may hail from a maligned city but that will be because they never came here and it was poor in the past, The only rail station that had buffers at the end of every line is set to blossom.
