2am and I can't stop cryingIt is 2 am and I can't stop crying. I want to die. I just dont' want to hurt my friends. I have the most wonderful friends anyone can hope for. I don't know what I did to deserve them but I love them so much. This is how much my friends care- when they found out I was suicidal, a few of my friends started a secret facebook group for me and just use it to talk about how I'm doing and how to help me. I have a friend staying over right now she is not a super close friend and doesn't really know what I am going through but I can't imagine letting her find me. I want the peace of death but I don't want to hurt those I love.I want to be free of this pain. Physical and emotional pain. I feel so incredibly depressed, and I am hurting so much inside. I am also hurting physically. I have Rheumatoid arthritis which is where your immune system attacks your joints. i am in CONSTANT physical pain. It hurts so much sometimes. It's also a progressive disease- after only five years of having it I already walk with a cane and sometimes am in a wheelchair when the pain is really bad. I can barely walk to get the mail. Yesterday I had to have my friend push me to get the mail. She is only going to be here a few more days. it hurts all the time and the pain meds don;t always help.i want to die, but i have a few friends who also struggle w suicidal feelings and i don't want to push them over the edge either, i am seeing my counselor tomorrow
