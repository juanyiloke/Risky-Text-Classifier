Ênew to thisI think I'm starting to develop an ED. I haven't been eating daily for about the past two weeks. My normal daily intake has been like 2 yogurts and maybe something extra like carrots or something. I might eat a few spoonfuls of food here and there. And this has led me to the following. If I feel my body is really hungry, I would just eat as little as I could. Now when I try to eat what would be close to a "normal" meal, I would feel a little sick/nauseated after. If I take about like a few spoonfuls of food, I would already feel full. There are short moments sometimes when I would feel nauseated, light headed or get head rushes. It's the morning right now and I just woke up, still laying down. I'm starting to really feel the effects now. I feel like I'm going to vomit or gag but why? I haven't even eaten anything. I can feel my body telling me it's hungry and starving but I still don't want to eat...I don't know what my weight was before this all started changing but I weighed myself last night. I think I lost around 15 pounds in two weeks or less. It's not like I'm super overweight either...I would say I'm average like 6 1 or 6 2 and 220lbs.This whole thing has been strange and new to me. Before, my normal eating habits have been where I tend to overeat or eat when I'm not hungry in a sense to over "satisfy" myself. This has been subconsciously slowly changing for the past month or two to where I am today. I don't know if this would be considered as an ED or not...
