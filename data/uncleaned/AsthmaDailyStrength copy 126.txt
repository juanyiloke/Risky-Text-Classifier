Here in OH we experienced some really cold weather temperatures in the single digits. On January 22nd, I was scheduled to work a shift but woke up having difficulty in breathing. My inhalers did not help, so I called in late.. Then a few hours later, I went in, fearing I'd lose my job, while still having trouble breathing. I managed to ring up two customers before I became too weak and about collapsed over on the turn table. Fast forward and I'm at the hospital for a severe asthma attack. Two days later I had another one that, then another and another. I was put on predisone and given a stronger dosage of Qvar. In the last three weeks since returning to work, I've only been able to work three days. The other times I'd work, then suddenly have an attack. Or I'd be going about my business at home and I'd have attack. My boss and sister suspected I had an anxiety, so I saw a counselor. Anxiety was ruled out. But the asthmatic symptoms have been a major concern for me lately. I can't even be in the cold for long, be around smells, or even eat certain foods without it causing the symptoms. Qvar and ProAir aren't working as well they should be. I'm even trying an allergy medication and mucus relief, which helped me out last summer. But now it seems nothing works. I don't feel any symptoms when I'm in a heated room. But now I'm at my wit's end. I see the doctor on Monday to tell her these inhalers aren't working as they should, and I'm getting discouraged. It's also discouraging when there aren't many people who know what I'm going through and just assume it's anxiety or stress. If anything is causing me stress it's the constant asthma attacks. I wish people could see that.. On a note, the place I work also has a cool temperature atmosphere.. But they do their best to keep me away from the doors where the cold air blows in every five seconds.. So that helps.. I'm not even sure what to do until I can afford stronger medication..
