 My boyfriend is noticing...My boyfriend is noticing I'm off. I don't know what to tell him. I feel like I owe him an explanation (we live together) but I'm too chicken to do so.I was trying to read a book today (a triggering self-help book, granted, that I'm finding the opposite of helpful) but I found my mind going elsewhere on every ****ing page. At this rate, it's incredible I get *anything* done. I could never figure out where the day goes and now I know: real time moves forward while I'm floating off to a time that no longer exists.I met with a new T yesterday and she gave me a list of grounding strategies…nothing I couldn't have found here or on Google. I think she might be good enough but I'm not yet sure. I'll see how it goes.Now that I've written this out I think I'll go ground myself by folding some laundry and delete that horrible book from my hard drive.
