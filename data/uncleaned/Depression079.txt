Your opinions on depression I'm using mental health as the subject for my university project and would like some thoughts on the subject. I'm focusing on depression and self harm as ive suffered with manic depression and self harm for 6 years (attempted taking my life 2 months ago). I would love to hear your experiences with the illness and how you've coped, struggles, and how you were to decribe it to someone who doesnt understand it. I would also appreciate first name and age for research refrencing! thank you
