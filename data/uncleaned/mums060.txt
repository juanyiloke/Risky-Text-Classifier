Feeing sad and anxious about dd. She is bright and cheerful, but a very curious and bold little girl, always asking questions. She has seemed a bit anxious recently, crying about small things, and saying she doesn't have anyone to play with in the playground. She has had 2 nice play dates recently and never seems upset about going to school. But I think she might be a bit lonely at break times. Off to see the teacher today and I am really worried I am going to cry about it, because thinking about her being sad makes me feel sad, and so trying to get a positive list of questions together. Any advice tips? May just need to blub now and get it out of my system
