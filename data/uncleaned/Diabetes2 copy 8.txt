Possible hypoglycaemic?  10  Hi all! Just wanted to see if anyone has had similar symptoms to me and if you had some advice.For 3 years now I've been suffering from tiredness, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, shakiness, lack of coordination and concentration and occasional vomiting and fainting. More recently I've been suffering from blurred vision and inability to think and speak clearly (stuttering and slurring words) and extreme thirst. I drink water constantly but always feel thirsty and have just grown use to it. After starting a full time job (a really great job!) I've been getting way worse, I think because unlike when I was studying I can't just come home after being out for a few hours and sleep like I feel I need to! I've been missing work and getting sent home after having funny attacks of the all the symptoms above. I saw a doctor and had a blood test and couldn't believe it when he said I was fine and its just stress. But I am not stressed! A friend of mine who is a nurse told me to test my blood sugar so for 2 weeks I have. In the morning I'm anywhere from 3.2 mmol/L to 4.8 mmol/L. Most days I am getting numbers around 3.2-4.8 mmol/L after meals, I've spent a lot of time in the 3's and even got a 2.7mmol/L reading last week just before lunch, needless to say I felt horrific.Has anyone else suffered from this? Any advice? I'm seeing another doctor Friday morning to show my results after he advised I continue monitoring my blood sugar for another week. I'm worried he won't be helpful as so far all doctors have brushed me off, saying I have eating disorders, I'm depressed or pregnant, I am none of these! I had blood work done recently but all came back fine, which I find confusing as a 2.7mmol/L is not fine! Any help or advice greatly appreciate, thank you so much! X
