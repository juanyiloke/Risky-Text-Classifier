Our failing schools!These tables are based on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils’ scholastic performance, performed first in 2000 and again every three years.This year it was maths, science and reading and guess what, we didn't make the top ten, we didn't even make the top twenty, we came in 26th! What an indictment of our screwed up education system! Following repeated intervention by successive education ministers, it is no wonder we are in the mess we're in. They are MP's first and foremost, and not educationists and should let teachers to decide what is best for our children.In my day, at six years old I knew all the multiplication tables because we learnt them by rote in morning assembly. I didn't know what they meant at that time but as soon as I started arithmetic proper, it all fell into place. Today even university leavers couldn't tell you what 9X8 was.
