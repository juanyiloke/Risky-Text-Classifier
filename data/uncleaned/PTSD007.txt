Apparently Sleep As A Parent Will Break Me.....ha!People keep telling me that a child/newborn waking you up overnight is bad and I have no idea what's going to hit me.Well I've been through velcro newborn, Velcro baby, teething and molars, 48hrs of gastro where she heaved every 15-30min, now a toddler and ahead of her age.....people, it ain't got shit onPTSD triggered nightmares.I've had 4 weeks of these bloody nightmares after a suddenly recovered memory wiped the floor with me.Just want to tell these idiots to kindly f*ck off and let me enjoy parenting. Its bad moments are still better that the best moments of PTSD.It just makes me want to laugh......parenting scary and I won't be able to cope, guaranteed to fail or screw my kid up? Bitch please, I've got CPTSD and I'm kicking it's arse every day I get out of bed.Honestly.
