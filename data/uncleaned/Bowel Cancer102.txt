Single parents with cancerSingle parents with young children can face a lot of difficult issues and heart-searching, especially with regard to what happens to their children if they should get really ill or die, how to tell the children, not having a spouse or partner to talk to, having to be there for the children no matter what, and many other things.This is a place for single parents to share their experiences, give advice, talk about their stresses, or whatever! But please don't feel that you can't offer advice, consolation or whatever if you're not a single parent. We're here to help each other along whatever our situation in life  .
