Feel a bit silly posting this since DD is almost 14 months. But... What were the obvious symptoms you had when teething? My DD has eight teeth and I think may be teething her molars but it's been going on for-bloody-ever and she doesn't have the typical dribbling or red cheeks. But she's constantly chewing two fingers down the sides of her mouth, has nappy rash on and off (which we've only ever had with teeth) all the time, often revolting smelling nappies, sleep is very broken with lots of random screaming episodes when she wakes, er, can't think of anything. Oh, wind, is that possibly related? Trumping like a docker at night.Does that all sound like teeth as opposed to anything else? Does anyone not get the dribbling or flushed cheeks? Or is it something else entirely?!ÊI have ended up giving her nurofen at some point through the night most nights recently. I don't really like to but am generally by then at a loss as to what else might be the matter.Currently in a darkened room with her asleep on. She goes bonkers every time I put her down.
