Newly diagnosed, need some answers :)  15  So I was diagnosed a borderline asthma very recently. My main symptom is shortness of breath. It's like I always need to work extra hard to breathe in and it can't go all the way In or I can't yawn properly. It gets worse when I work out or talk. I don't think I've ever had an attack, but this constant feeling of air shortage often makes me hyperventilate which then makes me dizzy. I'm also a mouth breather because my nose is constantly blocked. Since I was diagnosed I tried ventolin once but there was no relief at all.Has someone had these symptoms?Has anyone tried Buteyko breathing method and is it any good?Any ventolin experiences?Any other suggestions, tips, advices?I'm determined to tackle this and hopefully without any serious drugs...Thanks!
