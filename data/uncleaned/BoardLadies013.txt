The Fast Diet 5:2Has anyone done this before?? I'm thinking of trying it - I have heard someone at work say its good and they recommend it but I'm just looking for more opinions??Basically its where on two days of the week (you chose them) that you eat only 500 calories - no more. The other five days, you eat as you like, but healthy! Obviously I plan on doing exercise and stuff too, but just wondering what people think??
