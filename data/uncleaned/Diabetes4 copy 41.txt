FYI - BG/Cholesterol/Anemia meterObviously most people will have their favourite tried and tested meter, I'm still waiting for the Freestyle Libre to become available, come to think of it, I'm still waiting for an answer to my inquiry about availability.I'm not overly concerned about my cholesterol, but probably more than I should be and I have had several bouts of anemia whether that's Metformin related, I don't know, but I'd like to be more aware of. In my mooching around I stumbled across this meter which frankly seems too good to be true because a cholesterol only meter can be about £100. So I'm really just posting this message in case anybody is interested.
