What Happens? I've Had The Best Week I've Had Since February   notthesamewoot , Yesterday, 06:10 PMI'm currently sitting in front of a computer shaking bad enough I can barely type. Since my last post of I don't know what...... on April the 26th I asked my wife if our relationship was gonna work or not. She told me if I needed an answer that day it was no. I went into a full blown panic and went to be at home by myself. I had been staying with her at her parents house doing everything I thought I could to fix my shattered marriage. I went to see my psych on that Monday. He doubled my Seroquel dose and told me my nerves were toast at the moment. I reached out to a couple of my buddies that I had been staying away from and started hanging out with them. I've been to a therapist and my psych once a piece since then. I felt like a changed man with a direction. I even dubbed my plan the giving up and moving up. I have even drank a few beers since that sunday. Last night the constipation hit the point where I took some laxatives and was up all hours of the night going to the bathroom. I called in sick to work this morning and slept all day. I woke up feeling ok but as soon as I started moving around I got shakey. I attributed it to hunger so I mustered up the energy and had a snack. Im still shaking and all of the sudden all of my negative thoughts have returned. I took a 25mg seroquel as recommended and Im typing away waiting on it to kick in and make me sleepy. I had a direction. I had taken my wedding ring off. now its back on and I feel like Im throwing everything good I had away. Even though I know thats not the truth. From age 16 to 30 Ive been with the same person. People grow up and change. Its hard to let go of your best friend and a person you grew up with in spite of all the bad thats happened. What happened this afternoon? why did I go from solid as a rock to a pile of mushy emotions that cant stop shaking? If I could understand it I could stop it.
