A moment of success!I can officially call myself a college graduate, with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I majored in Computer Information Systems, and minored in General Business. It took 5 years, because of some scheduling complications, I couldn't get into some of the classes I needed to graduate in 4 years. I have to admit that I've been beating myself up over not being able to graduate on time, and throughout those years I've had a lot of ups and downs, but finally making it through is helping me learn a little about moving at your own pace, celebrating your own successes, and not comparing yourself too closely to everyone else. It's one of those lessons that I always heard, but was generally empty words to me. I still have a long way to go, but it's a start.I managed to get a perfect score on my final exam in my capstone course, Strategic Management. Honestly, I consider this a miracle, as I've had a few problems for the first half of the semester with corneal abrasions that were recurring every month or so, which left me in extreme pain and incapacitated for a few days each time. It kind of made things difficult to focus, but after finally seeing a cornea specialist, I ended up on the right path to treatment, and haven't had an incident since March. It really made my last semester of college a lot more difficult than it had to be, but I still made it through, and I'm pretty impressed with myself.I guess what I'm trying to say is: even though I still haven't actually done anything useful, maybe I'm not as hopelessly worthless as I thought. I still have a lot to do, like getting over my fears and learning to drive, and finding gainful employment, but I'm taking a step in the right direction, at least.
