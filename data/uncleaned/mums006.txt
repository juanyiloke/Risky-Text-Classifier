regularly to going 4-5 days between poos.Êby the 3rd ish day she starts doing really smelly farts and seems pretty uncomfortable, then by the 4th/5th day it starts to interfere with her naps and she is very squirmy and uncomfortable a lot of the time.ÊI do tummy massage and bicycling legs and it sometimes produces a bit of gas but no poo.ÊAnyone had this? any solutions? I know it's "normal" for BF babies to go days between poos but it's clearly not agreeing with her.ÊI know there are remedies like sugar water, prune juice or cotton bud up the bum but am worried she could become dependent on these if I use them?
