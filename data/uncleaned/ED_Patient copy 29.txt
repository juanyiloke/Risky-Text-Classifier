anyone have any answersso im crazy obssesed over my weight ive been overweight since having a child. i went down to 133 finally close to my pre pregnancy weight when i lost my job and started binge eating like crazy and went up to 145 almost immediately. i was literally stress eating . i have now been feeling so bad and dissapointed that i havent ate for 4 days i been doing crazy exercise and been taking laxatives heres the problem. i have had no bowel movements in these 4 days and i have only dropped 3 pounds. i dont understand its as if my body is fighting to not lose weight. ive had much success with my add medicine helping me out to supresss appetite in the past but now i just dont know what going on im desperate. i just feel ive been working so hard and no results im afraid of binge eating again. and i just cant deal with myself afterwards. i dont think i have an illness i just want to be at my prepregnancy weight so bad it hurts.
