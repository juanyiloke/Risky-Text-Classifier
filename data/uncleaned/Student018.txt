 University decisions....by ppeterHi, It's University Firm and Insurance time...I'm going to be studying Business Economics and I'm torn between two choices. Portsmouth University and the University of Westminster. If I do go Westminster, I will stay at home which means saving a lot of money..however the commute would be about an hour and a half just to get there. On the other hand, Portsmouth Uni does have a better reputation overall (I'm aware that both Uni's aren't the best). However, would the reputation gap between these two Uni's make a difference anyway? And if yes, how much of a difference?I would appreciate any responses. Thanks
