Scared  5  Hi, I've suffered with asthma since just after the birth of my twins 5 years ago, I was competly fine before then so was strange to me to suddenly develop this illness, so anyway ever since I was diagnosed ive been in and out of hospital a ridiculous amount of times, mostly on high care wards but have also been in intensive care a handful of times, at first my attacks didn't scare me too much, of course they were horrible but with every attack Im more and more scared, I've come to a point now where I'm scared just incase I have an attack, if that makes sense? I suffer from panic attacks Also and a lot of the time I have panic attacks because I'm scared to have an asthma attack, I have my peak flow meter so I can know how good or bad my breathing is but even if it's just a little below usual I find myself trying to keep blowing to get a higher result and if I don't i panic then I struggle to breathe, It's hard sometimes to differentiate between the two and I often feel like they both set the other off? Sorry this is my first post, never spoken to anyone about my asthma before other than doctors so I hope this makes sense? So guess I'm asking if anyone else struggles like this? X
