Prison EqualityHiI was poking around the guardian this morning and found this article on women in prison. Basically it seems that women prisoners are "vunerable" and only there because they have had a hard time in life and they shouldn't really be in prison, especially since the prison system is designed for men and doesn't suit them.I then went to the irish penal reform trust website to get some numbers on the % of male violent offenders and found that they too didn't believe in women going to prison. Further down there is an article about how womens sentences should be suspended ( A UN recommendation), if it serves the best interests of their children.ÊThat is a bit shocking for me tbh. Plenty of men in prison have children, yet their role in their childrens lives is not taken account. I'm not nieve enough to believe that they are all the best parents in the world but I think the same could be said of the women involved but yet they are treated differently. A a senior police women in the UK was recently convicted of bribary but the judge halved her sentence because she was in "the process" of adopting a child.I had to go elsewhere to find some rough numbers from a few years back that suggests that most prisoner aren't there for violent crimes. So why the focus on just women?I'm not a believer in prison or punishment as the only redress for crime. I think people should be punished but should also be given the help to get themsleves right. But I also believe that if half of society can be sent to prison for a crime, then the other half should have the them same and until alernative solutions are provided for both male and female, then one group should be treated as the other.Any opinions?
