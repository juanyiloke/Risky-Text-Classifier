Anterior resection syndromeHi everyone,First time I've used the forum, recommended by BBCancer nurse who said your support is great. I had low rectal tumour which was treated with radiotherapy, chemo and then anterior resection surgery back in 2011. Although all seems to be ok, I'm finding the consequences of the treatment a bit limiting e.g. urgency, clustering, fragmentation, unpredictability -you know the kind of thing. I avoid veggies and high fibre foods and use loperamide sometimes but still find going out can be tense and so have given up a lot of hobbies and lifestyle choices. Has anyone found anything that helps at this stage ?
