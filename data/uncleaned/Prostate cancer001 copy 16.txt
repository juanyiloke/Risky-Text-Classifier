Didnt see that comingHello Ladies and Gents,I'm 8 months post RP, I'm doing well and right on track they tell me, But whats really kncocked me for 6 is about of flu it began last Friday (13th ? ) by Sunday I decided to call the 111 number, I was in a desperate state, fortunatley they arranged for me to see a doctor at my local ( Minor) hospital, quicker than seeing my local GP .... he prescribed anti- biotics as I'm asthmatic and my chest always suffers,In the past few days I have never felt so ill, I had a flu jab in November too (wrong one grommit) the thought had entered my head that I survived the RP only to fall foul of the flu,  sods law Eh... but thankfully today there is a glimmer of hope I do feel a bit better.take care out there and dont be afraid to seek medical help, earlier the better !
