Breathing issues________________________________________So, I always have to have a fan goin, especially when I'm trying to sleep. No matter the weather outside, I just always have to have one going. If I don't have it running I get this feeling that I'm suffocating and that there isn't enough air in the room. Like, I literally can't breathe... I have no idea what's going on and it's been worse since I've been sick with a horrible sinus infection. What could be the problem? I don't feel myself wheezing that often and every time I go to the doctors/ER they say my lungs sound clear. And I also get this horrible pinching/sharp pain in my upper back, somewhat between my shoulder blades and on my sides and under my breasts. My asthma medicine will usually work for this or some type of congestion medicine. Then there's this feeling that my lungs are shaking. Yes, literally shaking and it'll get so bad that I will sometimes start to visibly shake on the outside. But if my chest is congested why do the doctors say I sound all clear? But why do I feel like I'm suffocating without the extra air and are my lungs actually shaking? What about the pain...?
