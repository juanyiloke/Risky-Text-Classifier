Happy to be melast night I was in pain, I think I have inflammatory arthritis. But as I was drifting to sleep, I realised that I am happy to be me. I am happy to have guinea pigs. Even though it's hard to take care of them when I'm depressed, they cheer me up and make me smile. I am happy with my apartment, it's my own place, cheap and quiet. Good neighborhood, great neighbors. I can go in the back to swing on the swing. I get to share my thirst for good health. I am happy with the way I look. I can wear dresses, and now I'm back at wearing nice shoes (as oppose to running shoes all the time) I think I'm beautiful with make up on, doing facials, painting my nails. I am happy that I write, make jewelry and paint/draw. I like what I do. I am happy I work hard to be healthy and lose weight. Even through the down times, I don't give up. I want to live and do things I like. I'm getting back on the horse and I feel great about it....
