ÊI need others' views/experiences of this situation please....I started a job several months ago and work in what appears to be a small, very supportive team and love my job.ÊMy Manager has been very supportive towards me and my mental health situation and I can honestly say that without his patience and empathy I probably would be out of a job by now.My colleagues are very supportive and I hear from people who work in other departments/buildings for the company that they dislike my manager as he is a bully, or they've heard it through the grapevine that he is.He does have a rigid, set routine of how our office is run and kept efficient, but I react better to that than having a manager who is slack! So in other words he sets boundaries that I like, I react well to and yet offers me regular support and has recently confirmed I am performing well at work.One of my colleagues, who has been in the office for several years has told me that the manager is supportive for the first few months, then changes his ways.The other colleagues in my team have never mentioned such things and appear happy at work.The manager is fully aware that several years ago I entered a legal battle with a previous company I worked for......An harassment case!Do you think what I am hearing from others could be unfounded or even if true, the fact I was in a legal case years ago would prevent anyone trying things on with me again?Thank you.
