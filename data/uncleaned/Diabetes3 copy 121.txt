Am I being unreasonable?rant alert...We are visiting my inlaws at the weekend, and will be going out for a meal to celebrate my MILs birthday and Mothering Sunday. My bro-IL said he would book the table. He was reminded several weeks ago that it was Mothering Sunday that weekend, it would get busy, so book early to get a table at a decent time. I don't know how many times I have said to my OH that I don't like eating late, as it leaves me with too much IOB and food in my system when I go to bed. My MIL doesn't like eating late either.So, today, OH tells me that the table has been booked for 8:15 cos that was the earliest he could get it. (I would point out here that bro-IL and wife normally eat at 9-10pm).Am I being unreasonable about this? OH wont confront his brother, neither will his parents, in case they upset him. (He can get very moody.) Every time we visit, we have this problem. Its just not fair!  (/rant)
