Ê"Here I go again. (On my own)" Sorry, song entered my head, Oh let me find a you tube video.I can feel myself slipping, actually I know I'm slipping, I can feel it in my bones literally. I know the reason why and I am more ready as such to deal with it and not to slip as low as you all on the forum know I can get.Don't get me wrong, I still have a good outlook of life, I have things like counselling in the pipeline.Even though I am slipping my moods are swinging like crazy and I'm either only sleeping a couple of hours or I'm knocked out for 16-18 hours, there is no consistency at the moment.I don't even know why I'm typing this, maybe to get it out as keeping it all in doesn't do me or anyone else any good.I'm going to fight it with all my strength though, I'm not going to let me slip into a toxic, harming mood. I'm over that so to say.My paranoia about this forum and what people think about me is back. Now, I know that not everyone hates me etc but I feel I'm getting ignored. Of course I know I'm not really.Can you tell my mind is going at 1000 miles per hour? lolI don't even know whether I am making any sense, I'm just typing what is in my head at the moment.I think I'm slipping because of a certain trigger I am going to be faced with over the next couple of weeks but it's also going to be in the place I love more than anything in the world.So yeah...Here's the video
