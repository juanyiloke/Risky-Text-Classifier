Does anyone else's general anxiety/panic attacks get worse after a good day?This might sound weird as good days are meant to perk you up. Yesterday I had a great day both in terms of enjoyment and low anxiety levels. I managed to go into town for the first time in over a year and it was jam packed because it was a sunny day and I managed to go around the shops and stayed for an hour and a half and took no panics. I was over the moon and it made me feel so proud and like the old me.I still have that proud feeling but also have noticed my anxiety in general has increased a little since I got back home. I have noticed that whenever I have a good day or good few days or weeks, my anxiety increases a little. Maybe it's because I'm worried it won't last or days won't always be this easy or something. I don't know for sure.Does anyone feel like this after a good period? I've also noticed I feel on edge if I start to feel good or calm! I must have been that hyped up and anxious for so long that its alien to my body to feel anything different!__________________"Save your sympathy for someone else. I don't need it or want it.
