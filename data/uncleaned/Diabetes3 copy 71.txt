VisionI've worn glasses since I was a teen. When I last had my eyes tested 2 years ago (I'm going again on Thursday!) my eyes had improved so my prescription was reduced (I didn't even realise eyes could get better!!)So in the past 2 days since I became unwell with the infection I noticed my vision was getting more blurred in one of my eyes.Today I've found it's easier for me to see things like this on my iPad, phone & reading packets without my glasses! I still need them for distance/watching TVs etcIt's weird! So, I don't know if my eyes are getting better since I've been on the meds over a week now or they are actually getting worse!\
