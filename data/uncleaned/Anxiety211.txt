Constantly overthinkingHi guys,ÊI just want to shed a little light into a potential problem I have and maybe get some thoughts on the matter.Overall I think I have a smart/organised very professional type of personality, although for a while I seem to be attracting a lot of drama in my life when it comes to work and I find myself talking and over reacting about issues in front of friends. Even worse when I have had a couple to drink.. I have a lot of stress and responsibility within my work and I think it takes a toll on me when I put to much on my shoulders. I feel like if there is a problem that I am the one who has created it. Although I always seem to be able to identify and fix the issue I just feel that I over react.. Or is overreacting due to my mental health? I trust people to much with my thoughts and emotions. I tell them my whole mind and obsess and stress about my issues to them. After these conversations take place I immediately regret having them. I feel that it has now taken a toll with my friendships. Like they think I almost can't handle life. Is this all part of my anxiety? Or is it a slight problem of mania?Thanks
