weight gain I am on seretide once in the morning and night and sabutomol when needed. I wos put on singulair a couple of months ago and had side effects so came off it. I have had asthma for about 4 months now and i have put half a stone on and can not shift any weight at all since going on seretide. I know it is supposed to go into ur lungs but sum of it does distribute into ur body. Does any 1 else have a problem with their weight. x
