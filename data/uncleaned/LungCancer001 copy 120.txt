Help Me find good cancer facilatiesHello everyone I am new here before I ask my question I would just like to say that I think cancer patients are some of the bravest people in the world. Well I am doing some research and I need some information on treatments for lung adenocarcinoma and the facilities where you got treatment from. I would also like to know if the treatment worked I could really use a few success stories. I would really like your opinion, what treatment didn’t work what treatment did work and the facilities you got it from.Thank you all for taking the time to answer my question.
