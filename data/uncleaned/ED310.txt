ÊI don't know what to do anymore...I'm away for the week, surrounded by my family, staying in my cousin's house. Lately, things have been super out of control. I've been made to go see my doctor multiple times because of my weight and my eating and have just started a new medication. I haven't been allowed to weigh myself in at least a month, but my doctor told me my weight and I've dropped a lot more than I thought. I'm also at my lowest calorie intake currently... and today has been particularly bad.I think I'm restricting more now because I'm surrounded by people who are constantly watching me, especially since all of my appointments. They're scared for me, and they're analyzing everything I do/eat. None of the foods I usually eat are in the house. Everything is very high calorie and full fat. There is nothing safe for me here. I'm really stressing and I don't know what to do. I feel like crying.ÊI haven't weighed this little since I was a child and that scares me, but the thought of gaining weight is terrifying, even though I know I need to.ÊI have no control over my life anymore, and no control over me. And I'm just not me. I hate this and I hate me. I can't be like this anymore.
