ÊDo you feel like a different person at night?I've noticed around 11pm, I start to feel different. I can't sleep until the sun comes up. I tend to do a lot of things that I have no memory of but have proof by FB messages, text messages, my boyfriend telling me, etc. The world feels heavier, my paranoia increases, voices louder, my feeling of dread deepens, and so on. It's like all my symptoms get worse and every time I look at the clock, it's always 11pm-12am when it starts. It's 12:20am right now. After I manage to fall asleep after the sun comes up, I feel my normal after waking up.ÊDoes this happen to anyone else? My doctor thinks it's DID. I would be so depressed to find out I have schizophrenia, major depression, PTSD, panic disorder and then DID on top? Sigh.Ê
