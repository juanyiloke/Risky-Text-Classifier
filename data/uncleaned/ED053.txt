ConfusedI don't know where I stand. I'm just very dissatisfies with myself. Extremes seem more pleasant to me. It's so wrong. I'm at a normal BMI right now but every time I eat I feel like I'm a giant. Once I slept dreamt I over-ate woke up at like 3am to work out.I have a rigorous exercise routine and restrict at school. Anytime someone says I've gained weight even as a joke is the beginning or a new mission to get rid of the new weight plus more. I don't know what to do I'm so consumed and what's worse is I don't want to recover. Any tip on the scale can determine how I feel an entire day. I don't know if anyone else feels the same way but my feelings are just all jumbled up I don't know how to go about this situation.
