  Surgery Tuesday and possible Bronchitis________________________________________I'm due to have Rotatorcuff surgery next Tuesday and my chest is tight and super sore...nothing seems to be helping..I've upped all my puffers (Ventolin,Symbicort and Spriva),I'm on 75 of Prednisone ..plus I'm on Z-pack antibiotics. I saw my lung doctor today a few days ago and again tomorrow but I have my pre-operative appointment on Friday! I've been waiting 8 months for this surgery and the pain is keeping me awake most nights I have to have this surgery! I'm sitting with a heating pad on my chest and trying not to wheeze or cough because it hurts so bad. So what can I take to get me better..quickly....I'm desperate. Just please list anything that's helped you before..thanks!!!!
