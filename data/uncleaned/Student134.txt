UCL vs. Warwick? Looking for any helpby adam.sosnowskiHi guys, I've been offered a place at UCL Statistics, economics and finance and at the Uni of Warwick Accounting and Finance. I have a big dilemma which course I should choose as a firm and insurance choiceI am looking for any help - all information is helpful! If anyone could compare these two unis and cities (prices, career prospects, living standards etc.), that would be absolutely great! The course at UCL involves a lot of maths what appeals to me, however I am a bit concerned of the fact that this course can put me strictly in the world of financial maths (banking, investment). I do not know what I want to do in the future yet - being a CFO, autiting, banking, investment. But I am concerned of the fact that this course can close me a few paths such as being a CFO, which doesn't not require as much maths, but business skills let's say. On the other hand, the course offered by Warwick is focused on accountancy, business law, management... Mainly business What do you think? Would be grateful if you could give me any info! Thanks in advance!
