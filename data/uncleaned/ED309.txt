ÊParents bully me over ED, don't know where to turn to?Hi there, I've had problems with anorexia for about 3 years now and though i am not dangerously thin and still relatively healthy looking 19 year old, my family bullies me over me not eating. Especially my father, yelling at me to sit the fuck down, stop being stupid and just eat. Then he just keeps making cruel comments like how i eat like a rat, and yells at me about why i can't be normal and compares me to other people. He crudely jokes about my relationship with food and my weight and is always yelling at me because if it isn't my ED, I'm always doing something wrong. My mom isn't as direct, as she kind of gave up on me.ÊI used to be overweight as a child and was bullied by my classmates and have been depressed and a bit suicidal for most of my teen years. When my depression came out in the open, my parents took me to a therapist, and when we got home just yelled at me for basically "ruining the happy family picture." I want to get better, but the fear of gaining **lbs back plus being at home makes me not want to eat at all.ÊSeeing as I can't go to my family and frankly therapists are useless for me, I've turned to this forum in hopes that someone here who might understand can help me what to do. It's getting to the point where I need to leave this house before I do something I'll probably regret.
