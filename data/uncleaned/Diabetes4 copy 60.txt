New update to NICE Guideline for T1 AdultsA some of you may know I've been on the Guideline Development Group for this over the last few years as a 'Patient Representative'. Members are sworn to secrecy about all discussions that take place around the table, so I've not really been able to say anything about it.But...We are now in the phase in the process where the Guideline is out for consultation with stakeholders.If you are interested, you can read the 'in development' Guideline here: http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-cgwaver122/consultationInteresting stuff in there about general target A1c's, recommendations for personalised targets, level of testing which has been shown to be effective (and cost effective!), basal insulins, hypo-awareness and lots more besides!It is due to be published later in 2015
