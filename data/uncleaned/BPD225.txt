ÊEnd Up Doing Drugs AgainBeen struggling really bad lately the war inside got so much harder again, locked away in my room feeling so lonely but don't want be around anyone, blaming myself for all the bad stuff I've done how things could of been different if I didn't do the thing if I wasn't me if I didn't have these stupid god damn problems why am I like this why does it have be so hard.So last night I went a brought some drugs for the escape, didn't get back home till 7 this morning, now the guilt is killing me and my emotions are so shit. I went 8 months or longer without them now I've come back to this again.Why can't I know what I want and not change every freaking 5 mins.
