CFA vs SOA-CAS2008-03-11, 02:52 PMI am still confused among Chartered Financial Analyst, Society of Actuaries and Casualty Actuarial Society, though I have some glimpse about them. I am not pretty sure if CFA could be a good stepping stone for SOA-CAS or they are totally different entity.If you have the chance, what would be your take then and why.How do they differ exactly. What are their essences. What are their advantages and disadvantages.What is the approximate percentage that their service be needed. What is the approximate percentage that their expertise do rendered.What would be your career path and time line if in case you would take it. What else should be considered.What are your other thoughts and knowledge about these certifications.Do you have any other advice if someone would take this field.Kindly share other informations or related links besides their official links through PMs if it is not advisable to post here.
