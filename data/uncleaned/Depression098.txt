I've lost my happy... I'm not really sure how to explain exactly how I am feeling...Lost is one way of putting it or just plain unhappy and I'm not sure why. I'm 27 with a good job and amazing colleagues...I suppose I have just lost my 'happy' and I have no idea how to get it back. I'm struggling to get through the days...not in an 'I want to end it all' way but that everything is an effort and seems rather pointless. I put on the cheerfulness but I'm just existing rather than living I think. I have no idea how to get out of this...Sorry...there seems to be a lot of 'I' in this post!
