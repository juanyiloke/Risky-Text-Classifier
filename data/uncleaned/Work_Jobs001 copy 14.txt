Offered a job at my old work place but hr blocked my re hire________________________________________So the issue is that while employed there in 2009 I was given a fiinal written warning over using a proxy bypass site to view a website I liked that had triggered a language filter on the company proxy (it was nothing illicit). After receiving the warning I decided to leave the company as it hadnt been a good fit for some time.Fast forward to last month and an old boss there contacts me about a job opportunitiy he thinks I would be ideal for, so I say great, I liked working with him. Only when he contacts hr they claim I cannot be re-hired as I was given a final warning over suspeted credit card stealing. I was never made aware that this is what they suspected nor am I astronomically stupid enough to do such a thing. Anyway i mostly dropped the issue as an annoyance but it irks me to no end. Given that it was only suspected on their end and theres no shred of proof to support their claim and that the incident is over 6 years old. Is there anything that can be done? Or should I just forget about it?
