ÊLaxative abuseHi allI'm new to this but would love some help and adviseI have been hooked on laxatives for about 7 years I can not go to the toilet without them now,ÊI'm in a good loving relationship and me and my partner want to have a baby but I can't stop taking the laxatives I'm terrified of gaining weight witch is silly as I'm already overweight, I'm totally obsessed with food weight laxatives diets it's all I think about,Recently I think my body is rejecting the laxatives and they just seem to make me throw up now,Was thinking of talking milk of magnesium instead but don't know much about it and I'm worried I will get addicted to that too??Any help and advise would be really great I'm feeling so low and desperateThank you
