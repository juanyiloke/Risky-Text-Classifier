My baby boy is 9 weeks and EBF. In the last few weeks we have tried him with a bottle of expressed milk and he will suck it but spits out most of the milk. Hubby has got us tickets for a boxing show and my FIL is happy to babysit but the show is 7pm-11pm and my LO doesn't usually go down until 8.30 ish.ÊWould it be okay for me to give him a big feed before I go and leave grandad with twice as much expressed milk as he'd usually take during a feed?ÊI'll only be a 20 min drive away so I can get home if necessary. I suppose I'm looking for advice, would you go? Is it too soon to leave him?
