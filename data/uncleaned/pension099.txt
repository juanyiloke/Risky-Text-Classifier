TeachersOnce again just as one of my grandchildren come up to the most import and life changing period for exams the selfish teachers vote to strike - just selfish arrogance - how do they think their inflated salaries are going to be paid in the future if our most precious commodity - our young children- are to be denied the fulfilment of their education. All right I know it is only the lunatic fringe that are HELL BENT ON CREATING ANARCHY!
