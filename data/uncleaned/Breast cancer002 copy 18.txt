surgery¥	hi I am new to the site. Have just been diagnosed with idc stage 2 on 15th April. Have got my date for surgery on 19th may. Started fertility treatment with my husband today to preserve embryos for future just incase chemo stops me from being fertile. All a bit overwhelming and have so much info to think about in a short space of time. Only married about a year and didn't expect to have to deal with something like this ... Not sure about what to expect after surgery and how I will feel about it all ... B x
