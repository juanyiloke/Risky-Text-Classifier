How to 'find' a Domestic Cleaner?My mother is in need of a domestic cleaner to give her house a good clean approx once a fortnight, the trouble is that she doesn't know who to ask. And neither do I, hence this message.ÊNaturally she wants someone 100% trustworthy and reliable - are there any good companies who she should approach, or other options which she should examine? I've already phoned Age UK and am awaiting a reply.She lives in North Somerset.Thank you.
