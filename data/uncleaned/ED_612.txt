Finally going to kick assI had an eating disorder in my teens and although I was mostly recovered I have struggled to rid myself of the behaviours completely. Towards the end of last year the behaviours started to become my go-to coping method rather than my coping method of last resort and I was at risk of falling back into full diagnostic criteria. So after Christmas, seeing friends attempting dry-January I decided to do an ED-free January to prove to myself I could cope without ED behaviours .... and succeeded! I have never been one to count days etc but right now I am willing to try anything. My aim is to get to the end of each month without ED behaviours and count how many months over the year I have had. So far I have managed January and March, unfortunately I didn't manage it in Feb but only because of one day so still fairly pleased. I thought that putting this here might help keep me on track
