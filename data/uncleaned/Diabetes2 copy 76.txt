IGT Impaired Glucose Tolerance   Hi just been diagnosed with IGT yesterday. I am 5ft 5'' and lost weight and now weigh 8st 8lb. I am 56 and haven't smoked, rarely drink and keep fit. Was told on the phone my the practice nurse that I have this. As I was not overweight all I needed to do was to go for another glucose test next year. When I looked on the internet it said that some people can develop diabetes from this. As there is a family history of diabetes with my gran having type 2 and on tablets I am now worried I could be even more at risk. I presumed that if I was overweight I would be more at risk of IGT or Diabetes not being normal or below weight. Is there anything else I can do but watch my weight, exercise and eat healthy. Is there any connection with this with coealiac disease or gluten intolerance.
