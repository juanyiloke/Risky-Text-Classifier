 Flashbacks as hallucinations...is this PTSD? (Triggering content hidden)I’ve had flashbacks for years,However, last night (and one other time a few months ago) I had a flashback (probably a flashback anyway) as a hallucination…or at least I think it was a hallucination. I mean I know I wasn’t seeing something real, but I’m not sure what to call it exactly.The basic (non-triggering) version: I saw something reflected in a window that couldn’t have been there, something related to my PTSD. It’d have had to have been in the room (for various reasons described in the hidden sections), and there wasn’t anything, so I know I wasn’t seeing something real. It was like a flashback, only it wasn’t in my head, I literally saw it in the window.More triggering, more detailed version:More details, even more triggering than the previous ones:Is this a part of my PTSD? Can PTSD cause a hallucination like that, or should I look at other possible causes? (I am on some medications, I could look at side effects from those.) I’m just not sure though, because the hallucination relates to what caused my PTSD and is almost like an external flashback. What do you think? And is there anything I can do about it, or do I just need to manage it like a regular flashback?Thanks for the help :3
