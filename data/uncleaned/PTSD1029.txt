I have these super vivid nightmares several times a week. They take place in real time, I believe they are occurring as I dream them. The theme is always the same: "They" (police, government agents, murderers, whoever) are busting down my front door, rushing in and dragging me out of bed (to kill me, torture me, interogate me, put me in a concentration camp, etc). I usually wake up at this point. Other times I wake freaking out in the livingroom because I'm trying to stop them from breaking in. The scariest is when I wake up and BELIEVE "THEY" are actually at my bedside - - I would swear in court that there are real people in my bedroom. Behind these dreams is a history of abuse and a diagnosis of post-tramatic stress disorder, but I need to know how to break the cycle before I have a heart attack out of fright! Has anyone heard of "lucid dreaming" where, in the middle of the nightmare, you remind yourself that you're dreaming and change the outcome of the dream? I read about it online but I couldn't figure out how to put it into practice. I practice relaxation each night before I fall asleep. I also use a sound machine set on the ocean setting to try to occupy my brain.
