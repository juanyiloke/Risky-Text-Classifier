How soon after coming off the pill did you fall pregnant?Hi Ladies,I'm not actually plannning on getting pregnant any time soon, but I would like to have a child one day so I'm just wondering.I've been on the pill for about 7/8 years now, I'm concerned that this is a long time and it might affect my ability to conceive in the future - have any of you ladies taken the pill for around the same length of time and then stopped to get pregnant? Did you succeed? Was it quick or did it take ages?ÊJust looking for general experiences of coming off the pill and then getting pregnant, I've been thinking of going 'natural' so that if I do want to conceive in a year or 2 I'll be all set to go!
