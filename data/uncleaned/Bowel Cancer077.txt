Post reversal. Should I be worried?I'm 1 week post op with some early diarrhea but have not had a BM since Tuesday AM (36hrs)I've been passing wind and eating regularly but not going for such a long time is starting to worry me. No urgency, no leakage as per the early days is this normal?I've got no pain so don't feel constipated but just very anxious at not going. I was readmitted on Sunday (released Monday) following a bout of vomiting and it was found that I had a bug so placed on antibiotics yesterday could they be slowing things.Merry Christmas
