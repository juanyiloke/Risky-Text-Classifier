Still struggling Ive not long been diagnosed with asthma, im 19 years old.At first with just the reliever inhaler i was doing ok, but after a while i started to feel breathless and wheezy again. I went back to my doctor and he gave me the preventer inhaler and ive been using that. But when i stop using it i get really bad again. When im using it i feel much better, but the nurse said use it for 2 weeks and i have and then stopped it and now im back to wheezing and coughing and suchAnyone know what i can do?
