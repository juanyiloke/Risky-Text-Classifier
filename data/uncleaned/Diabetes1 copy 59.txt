What's it like to have a child diagnosed with diabetes?I never had children of my own, but I was very young when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I know how it felt for me (I thought I'd never be able to eat another cookie or brownie as long as I live!), but I can't imagine the mental anguish it must have meant for my parents. Especially my mother, because diabetes runs in her family. She's not much of a talker, so it doesn't do me any good bringing this up with her, but I've always wondered what it must feel like finding out your child has diabetes. Obviously, it's manageable, but it's not one of those things you look forward to, like their first tooth or first word. (Not that kind of milestone!) Any parents of diabetic children feel like sharing? Thanks so much. I know it's got to be hard on you, so if it's too much, please don't feel obligated to answer. Thanks, again!
