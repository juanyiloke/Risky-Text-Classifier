bulimia?OK well i'm not one to admit having any problems... why? because i'm a perfectionist. Maybe thats why (at 5'2\&quot  i only weighed 94 lbs when i was 14However i WILL admit to having Bulimic tendencies. When i was 14 i purged for the first time. In the beginning i'd only purge after consuming ice cream, and i never REALLY threw up any large quantity of food.Over the course of a year i probaby only purged about two to three dozen times, and for a while i stopped entirely.But then once i turned 16 i started purging again. NEVER binging though. or taking laxatives. Nothing too serious. But after puring only a few times a month, infrequently, my condition got worse. I'd make myself throw-up every night. However, this lasted for only about a month or two. Because although i'd feel guilty about eating, i'd feel guilty while standing bent over in the shower while shoving my fingers down my throat.Then, this past spring, i met someone really special. We made a deal together; i would stop purging and he would stop popping pills. Then, whenever one of us slipped up, we had to tell the other person.Since i made the deal, i've only purged about a dozen times. The last time i did was early june.I wouldn't like to classify my disorder, but if i had to, i'd say i was a recovering bulimic. Because addictions are usually impossible to get over 100
