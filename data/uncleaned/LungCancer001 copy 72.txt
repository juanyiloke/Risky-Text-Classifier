First Oncology AppointmentHello to all,I am new to forum......I found out last week that I have lung cancers (small cell). The mass was found when preparing for a back surgery, the surgeon has all his patiants go through a physical. One of the test is an x-ray of the lungs, my PCP called right after the x-rays to inform me the radiologist found a mass on my right lower lung.The radiologist found 3 cm x 4 cm x 6 cm, my doctor ordered a CT Scan which confirmed the mass and it's size. I had a biopsy last week and my doctor called last Thursday to inform me that I had small cell cancer, that's all she knew at that time, she only called to get the ball rolling. I have an appointment with an oncologist tomorrow to discuss what happens next.Needless to say I am scare...I feel awful.I am 48 years old and smoke, I have worked in the construction fields 30 plus years.I don't know what to expect, I have been trying to read up on everything but it can be confusing.Does anyone have any advice?Thanks,Charlie
