Feeling beatenHi im a newbie to this site, I have battled depression among other issues for some years. I have been very well but in the last month or so have been on a downhill slide. I am a single mum of 3 beautiful girls but find I am very limited to being able to work atm, this has left me lonely, isolated and feeling unmotivated and just want to sleep and do nothing, as I have just moved to another area and cannot really get out I am finding strategies of meeting new ppl yet alone friends very difficult. If anyone has any suggestions or wants to be friends it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to get the spring back in my step to be the best person I can be but I'm not doing that very well
