CAN'T stop binging.i had anorexia last year but I've gone the other way now and keep binging. I have been binging for about 5 months and gained 16kg so I'm now overweight. I am fine in the morning and afternoon but soon as night comes, I'll eat the whole kitchen!   It is wrecking my body image and self esteem which were already pretty low. I feel ashamed and embarrassed to be seen cause I feel so fat. I hate wearing tight clothing cause I feel like their gonna  explode because I'm so fat. I've tried losing weight but then as soon as i restrict my diet I'll binge more. Aaaaah!!. Help please, anything that has stopped you binging would be very very appreciated.
