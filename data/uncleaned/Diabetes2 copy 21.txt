Morning blood glucose  3  my gp has asked me to start taking my blood sugars on a 4 day cycle - morning, lunch, dinner and bed. Bed is obvious, lunch and dinner I take just before I eat but the morning is not so obvious. If I take it when I first wake up at around 6.30am it has been as high as 16.2, but if I take it just before breakfast at around 8am it has been as low as 8.2. (Still high I know but lower than it has been) when do people suggest I take it in the morning. Your help is much appreciated. I do not want to give my GP misleading figures.
