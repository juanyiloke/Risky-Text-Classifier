Our freestyle libreThought I would give a review of this reader. Son is 20 years, only the size of a 14 year old and has learning difficulties, is deaf and was diagnosed with type 1 just over 1 year ago. He is on mixed insulin twice daily for the moment as this suits his lifestyle. He has no hypo or hyper awareness but we have a very good HbA1C although inexplicable readings like everyone else. Motivated to get libre so that we could see what goes on in between finger pricking and hopefully to reduce those pricks as far as possible. We sometimes have lows in the morning and sometimes highs when we have done exactly the same things so wanted to see if he goes low at night and rebounds and so on.We are now on the 3rd day and the readings are extremely accurate and were from the very start. He drinks a lot of water during the day so no idea if keeping well hydrated might help. The insertion was completely pain free, he said he didn't feel a thing but was obviously a little perturbed by having it attached to him in the first few hours as his BG went weirdly higher. In the last 2 days, it has been invaluable. Last night he was low from the early hours, just under 3, so will reduce insulin a little tonight. Have also discovered that he is much more insulin resistant in the mornings and even the lowest carb breakfast causes a bit of a spike, not as much in the evening when he has a large dinner. Exercise brings him down very quickly.Only issue is that the adhesive around the sensor has come a little loose in one place so may take a trip to Boots to find something to keep it in place as can't imagine it would survive 14 days. Don't know whether we will use this all of the time but very impressed so far.
