Private HealthI brought this topic up else where but thought it worth starting a new topic. Having to go both private  in UK and in Tenerife in the last year or two I found in UK you will pay around 80 pounds and then lots of add ons in Tenerife 65 euroes and no add ons. Because of lack of interest in my cough it got steadley worse and had to see a local private doctor. It was going to be 3 sessions of injections and neblizer followed by a check up. On the checkup although much improvement had been made a further 2sessions would be required but they would only charge me 60eu for both of them. They have now got rid of the infection which was pretty bad and now on medication and inhaler to completely get rid of the cough got to go back in a weeks time for a check up no charge. Prescriptions in UK a charge is made not here also extra charge for injections and nebllizer. PS. Exchange rates 1pound equals 1.24 euroes.
