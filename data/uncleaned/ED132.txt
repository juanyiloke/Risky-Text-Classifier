how to help others and yourselfhithis is my first post on here.i have been recovering for about 2 years now. I think i have gotten so much better, but still have a long ways to go.i am actively helping people at my school who speak about their eating disorders and I think they see me as a very strong person when im really not! i help so many people but i can barley help myself. does anyone have advice for this?i want to be there for everyone but so often nobody is there for me.
