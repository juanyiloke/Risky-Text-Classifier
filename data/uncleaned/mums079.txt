Hi everyone,DD, DH and I are going to West coast of Scotland on holiday next weekend for a fortnight - self catering, middle of nowhere, no phone signal! DD is 12mo and can't quite walk yet but is cruising proficiently and standing by herself. I am looking for tips to make this holiday as stress free as possible!ÊSpecifically I guess I'm looking for tips please on keeping Dd entertained on journey, things to pack that I might not have thought of, and how to keep everything organised -she just seems to need sooo much stuff! How did you do holidays like this with your toddler?TIA, wise mumsnetters!
