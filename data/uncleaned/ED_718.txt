Dream about being fat. Should I be worried?I must start off by saying I do not currently and I have never had an eating disorder. But the last few days I have lost some weight because I haven't been eating due to my anxiety regarding a totally different matter. But when I looked at the scale I liked it and I don't want to gain it back. I'm starting to eat a bit more but I don't like it. Then last night in my dream I looked in the mirror and was pretty fat. In the dream I then decided to stop eating. In real life I know that I'm skinny though, but there's a little bit of fat on my stomach I'd like to burn off. Should I be worried about developing an ED or is this normal teenage girl worries?
