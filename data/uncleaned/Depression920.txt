How do I make him understand?My husband is very supportive of me and what I'm going through. But he gets upset when I have. Day off and im upset all day. He takes it very personal and thinks I'm not happy with him since the only time im like this is on my day off. It's not that though. He's the only thing that makes me have any happiness in life.ÊI work and go to school. Several days a week I'll have over 15 hour days. I Have to fake smiling at work and I have to maintain my composure at school. It's exhausting enough to do those things but when I have to fake being okay during it as well, it's almost unbearable. So when I have my day off, I just want to sleep and cry and do whatever I can't do during the week and I feel really bad that he has to deal with it but I don't know what else to do.All of these emotions get bottled up during the week and the one day I have off from both school and work, it becomes overwhelming and I. Just so depressed and have no energy.I just want him to understand that it's not him. I try my best to explain but I cant. I feel so bad and don't know what to do
