Low blood sugar.I have not been  diagnosed with anything, but over the last 6 months I have passed out twice with low blood sugar. I have an appointment at the Endocrine unit next week. I also have and appt with the GI clinc in November as it have been found that I have errosion in the osephegus and inflamation in my bowel. It's the passing out with the low blood sugar which is of most concern as it happens really quickly. Has anyone got any ideas what can cause this, and I am eating normaly. Has happend twice 2 hours after I have eaten.
