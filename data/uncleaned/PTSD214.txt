Newly Diagnosedby usmc_luv » Thu Apr 16, 2015 9:50 pmHi, I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from sexual abuse and emotional abuse. This is something I have had since I was probably about two years old, but I was never properly diagnosed. I had a meltdown which wound me in the hospital. They sent me to a behavioral clinic to treat me, and then because of my exceptional progress I was quickly released to go back home. I am now home trying to learn more about my disorder, so I can go back to school next semester feeling better. In doing this I decided to join this forum to meet people that can truly understand what I am going through. I am trying to find outlets for my own personal therapy, like writing and singing. I have a fiance who is in the Marines and he is stationed far from me. He is my best friend, but he is not always free to be there when I need him. This is why I have come to this forum. I welcome any friends, prayers, and advice.Thank you.
