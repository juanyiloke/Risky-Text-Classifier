  A good christmasSo I started outfeeling depressed  and lonely. No family here to share it with , just me and my three dogs , and no presentsunder  the tree except for the three I had bought for my dogsBut xmas morning  my Daughter  skyped me and I got to watch my Grandkids opening their pressies , which was awesome and made me laugh  no end and chatted with Jean (my Daughter) and her fella  After that I got a visit from my Dad and Brother , and between them they gave me more than enough money to buy Toffee and Teddy their Julius K9 harnesses , which was very sweet of them and im so pleased I can get my dogs those nowThen I took the dogs out for a long  walk , it was gorgeous out and no-one was around to spoil our walk  Then at tea-time my best  friend Steve turned up (he was working so we had a late xmas dinner) and he gave me 100 ciggies and then produced a present  my dogs had bought me (clever things border collies huh , lol)A kindle fire      The evening I spent curled up in bed watching a movie surrounded by three very content dogs ... perfectionSo what I thought was going to be a miserable xmas turned out to be lovely
