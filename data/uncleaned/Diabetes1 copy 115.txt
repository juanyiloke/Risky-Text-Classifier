Bullet proof coffeeOk friends I'm going to do a week on this. As per @Brunnaria advice got really posh coffee to try and stop the spaced out feeling..so I've just made it and properly with butter and coconut oil and frothed it up and put it in a warmed thermos...I have to say no oily taste at all. Just creamy and lovely. 1 hour in. Bright energetic and no hunger! Will post as I go on..no greasy feeling this time in my tummy either.. I'm doing this as I really don't want to lose any more weight and I've tried upping protein but its turning into glucose and raised my readings. I'm on 45 g of carb. So trying to up fats a bit..too much cheese makes me nauseous so making brilliant green and rainbow salads and putting ceasar dressings and olive oil on...watch this space..I lost a further 2 lbs this week so really needed to stop it. No more carbs. No extra protein leaves fats. So extra adventurous ways will be interesting. Wish me luck?
