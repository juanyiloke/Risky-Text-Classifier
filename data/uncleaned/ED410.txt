ÊIs This a Problem? Trigger WarningHi everyone, I have some questionsHere is a bit about meI am overweight, and for the last maybe 4 or 5 months have been purging maybe a couple times a week but lately it's been a few times a day. I sometimes binge on food, I have an obsession with food. I feel like it's the only thing that mattersMy questions is, would this be worth bringing up to my therapist? Or is this nothing to worry about? (I don't have an eating disorder, the purging is just something I do sometimes I just didn't know where else on the forum this would fit)
