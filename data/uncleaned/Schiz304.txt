My sister is really not doing well. She has dissociative personality disorder (NOT dissociative identity disorder), PTSD, and probably some undiagnosed stuff as well. She has been living in a truck in Florida, but she still has a NY driver's license. So she is applying for Medicaid in NY. I really want her to get inpatient treatment, because she can not take care of herself at all, and she is pretty close to suicide. She's already tried once last month, and a few more times throughout the years. I have finally gotten her to agree to check herself in. What do I have to do to make sure she gets admitted there full time? Does Medicaid cover the cost, or are there other expenses? How long will they keep her for? What are her options after she gets out? I can't let her live with me, because she will just continue living a bad lifestyle and never get better. How does she qualify for a group home/assisted living situation?
