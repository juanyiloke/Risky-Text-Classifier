Over eatingHi all, I'm a newbie here, first time poster. Im a 29 year old female, kinda nervous to be here but here goes. I was just wondering if anyone else out there relates to over eating on a regular basis, due to depression, or even those who have low days without having diagnosed depression.. . I don't want to get caught up with the label of 'eating disorder' and mental health illness, basically its eating to fill a void and eating to the point of feeling sick..... aka binge eating. This is my life, and once apon a time my eating was mostly in control, it has gotton worse the last few months, and I am feeling less and less in controlSo, if anyone feels like sharing their story, please do. I really just am trying to feel less alone at the moment and I am not trying to judge or compare......so, Id love to hear from you, and thanks everyone.
