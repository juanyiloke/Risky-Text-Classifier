How did your partner react when you told him/her you have diabetes?I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 25 years old; after the diagnosis, I did some dating, but never actually settled down with anyone and never got married (or had children). I know in this day and age, what with diabetes being so popular, telling someone you have diabetes is no big deal. It once had a stigma attached to it, but that was years ago! Now, people just take it in stride. In fact, people almost expect you to have it, nowadays! When I go to the clinic, the first thing they ask you is: Do you have diabetes? They don't ask " do you have cancer?" Or, "do you have multiple sclerosis?" Or, " do you have asthma?" They ask if you have diabetes, like it's commonplace! And the scary part is, more patients say Yes than No. (Obviously, me being one of them!) When I was first diagnosed more than 15 years ago, it was just getting started; and after I was diagnosed, it seems like everyone else I knew "came down with it" soon thereafter! All my life, people were telling me my eating habits were atrocious, so when I told people I had it, they weren't even surprised! And when I told my dates, they all took it in stride. I thought they'd make a bigger deal of it, but they never did. And what's more, they all knew someone who had it, too. What about you? How long have you had diabetes and how did your partner(s) take the news? Thanks for sharing!
