Delusions based on truth?I get myself so worked up over things that that may or may not be legit. I can't tell if I'm being delusional or rational. For example, my boyfriend is friends with a girl online and I had this feeling that it was something more. Like I kept thinking and thinking about it. I even "proved" to myself that there was something going on. I got to the point where I just "knew" it. So i told him that I KNOW something is going on between you two... Just be honest with me so that I can move on.ÊHe told me there was nothing at all going on. Now that I'm closer to the situation I have again given myself "proof" that nothing is going on between them. Like analyzing every little thing that they say back and forth.ÊHow do you over come this? How do I know if it's anxiety talking or if I should be concerned??
