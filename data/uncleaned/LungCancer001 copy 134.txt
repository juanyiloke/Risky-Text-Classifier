NewbieMy name is Melissa, I am 59 years old and have been diagnosed with cancer in the left lung. We are still waiting for the extensive biopsy report to see what stage and kind of cancer it is. As of right now it looks like either spindle cell sarcoma or mesothelioma. My slides are at Mt Sinai being looked at by a specifically requested pathologist because it looks like a rare and complicated deal. I have a 5 cm mass in the lower part of the upper lung, two smaller masses higher up and a lymph node in the middle of my chest. I have lost 14 pounds in 10 days, and have no appetite. I am 100 lbs overweight, so I can afford to lose it, but that seems awfully fast. I am taking prednisone 10 mg and Percocet 10 mg tid for the pain. I have night sweats, too. I have a good oncologist and a surgeon from Mt Sinai, although this doesn't look like it will be operable. Does anyone have any advice for me? Anything I should or shouldn't be doing? I'd appreciate any words of wisdom.
