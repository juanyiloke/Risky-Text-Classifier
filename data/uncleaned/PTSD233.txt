Therapy for cPTSD vs depression?by LostMan » Sun Nov 09, 2014 3:24 pmI've been in therapy for a while for depression and it really hasn't been helping. I got perscribed cymbalta and it also hasn't helped that much either. Broke down and tried medical marijuana and it helped the cptsd but it's hard on my heart so I need to stop.Is there really anything different with therapy if you are being treated for c-ptsd/ regular ptsd than just depression? After cymbalta I'm really not ok with trying meds beyond simple natural things like what a naturpath could give me, and it's not that I think meds are horrible and should be banned, I'm just pretty sure they do not work for me.
