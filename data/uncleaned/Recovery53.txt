A Good Unnoticed Consquence Of A Med Change.Recently I went back to a job that involved stressful customer service.  It was always a job I could do, but it took a toll on me mentally and also seemed a hair beyond my capabilities.  Recently I got changed on my meds, now I take lithium and seroquel.  I didn't realize till my second day back to the job being put in the stressful customer service role, that my concentration has improved immensely.  It was like I was a different person in that position.  Calm as can be, until being up since 7 pm the previous evening I started to slip at a around 1 pm, and I had done it since about 930 that morning.  I am so proud and happy of this.  This is amazing.
