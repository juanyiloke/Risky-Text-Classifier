Divorced and House SalesI'm new to the forum and would ask if anyone can advise me as to my rights and suggest any possible action to a problem I have. I divorced in July 2010, my former wife and I agreed we would sell the former family home and split if 50/50. I moved out she stayed in. We agreed on an Estate Agent to try and sell it and they appear to have done their best but it still has not sold. I am aware of the current economic climate but my feeling is and substantiated by one of my children (Adult) that potential buyers are being somewhat put off. A fact I cannot prove. My problem is having paid out so much to her in settlement and now relying on my pension I need the house to be sold but what can I do? I cannot afford to go to law and even if I could I'm not sure what the law could do. Any advice please or do I just sit back and shut up? Thank goodness I've got less to do than I have already done.
