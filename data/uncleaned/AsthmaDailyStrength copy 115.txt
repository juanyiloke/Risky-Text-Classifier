I am 48 and have recently been told I have asthma. I did have a spot on my lung seen in xrays. When I had a deeper penetration xray it had diminished. The doctor put me onadvair and said I have very sensitive lungs which causes my bronchial tubes to contract and cause pain in my chest. Has anyone else experienced this or could it be something more serious like COPD? I find when I go to the gym and exercise I have less issues because I am taking deeper breaths. The advair does help though. I use it as needed which is ordered by the doc. I was told I have bronchial asthma.
