Anyone else feel you don't really make friends at societies?byÊ>Username<People always say 'join a society you'll make lots of new friends'. I'd say that was quite the opposite! Societies are run by second/third years who already have friends in the society as they were there last year. Hardly any first years even join societies in comparison to second/third years.ÊI'm trying my best but I feel I am going literally no where. In my societies people tend to come in and do the activity of the society and that's it. Nothing else.ÊHas anyone else experienced this with societies? I just want to know when it gets better! And if it does!
