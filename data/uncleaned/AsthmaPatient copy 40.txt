for the past 3 weeks i had shortness of breaths  9  started about 3 weeks ago at work. only lasted maybe 20 mins. went away. didnt think much of it. then couple days after it happened again and same thing. but then it started happening more often. it happens more in the morning and at night. also my nose is always stuffed. that started happening about the same time. i finally went to see the doctor cause i had an attack. the worst. freaked me out. i also have anxiety too. so the doc gave me an inhaler yesterday of albuterol. i tried it this morning. i did my first puff and i dont think it worked very well. waited 10 min. and did another. how long it takes to work? first panic and anxiety attacks now the doc say i have asthma. does anyone else only suffer in morning and night? and why only morning and night?
