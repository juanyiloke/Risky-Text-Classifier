My mother wants me to have kidsI'm so sick of the pressure. I posted something on facebook about me getting the CGM and my husband made a joke that we should test it out, hint hint. Well, my mum came on and said 'I'm hoping for some excitement, that might mean GRANDCHILDREN'. She did the capitals as well.If I fell pregnant now I'd never get the pump, but besides that, my hba1c is 8.7, far too high, and I have too many hypos. But it's like she cares more about having kids than my health. Let alone the damaged I would do to the baby. And I don't need constant reminders that I'm already 31 and that time is running out. I know.
