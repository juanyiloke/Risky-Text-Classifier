First Post On This SiteÊ  TRF ,Ê28 Apr 2015I am 41. ÊI have been depressed my whole life but I didn't really understand what I was experiencing until I was about 38. ÊI have suffered from Trichotillomania since I was about three years old. ÊI have had OCD since about the age of three. ÊI have had anxiety and depression since about the age of three. ÊI don't think I've ever been able to truly experience happiness or sadness. ÊI think of everything logically. ÊI feel that life is empty and meaningless. ÊI take 225mg effexor, 40mg of Busirone (Buspar), trazodone to sleep, and currently I am taking Strattera for ADHD. ÊI have suffered migraines since about the age of 10. ÊI used to think that things would get better but about three years ago I lost my business and a wife and have been without hope. ÊI think about suicide usually at least once a day but I have a twelve year old daughter and I am worried about the effect that it would have on her. ÊI have seen therapists and have listened carefully to their suggestions. ÊThey suggest exercise and meditation. ÊExercise has never been a good option for me as I sweat from walking down the street and exercise causes me to sweat so bad that it runs in my eyes. ÊAlso, when I am social settings I never think of anything to say which has always made me uncomfortable. ÊI have gone to many concerts and stand there not enjoying it, just looking around at what is going on and thinking about it abstractly. ÊWhenever I am doing any activity with other people I am usually waiting for it to end. ÊI feel tired most of the time and see going to sleep as an escape from my anxieties. ÊMy medicine keeps me from going into the darkest of my thought patterns but leaves me just capable of being able to calmly contemplate the nothingness I feel. ÊI feel trapped in this world. ÊWondering if anyone can relate to the combination of tortures I have?
