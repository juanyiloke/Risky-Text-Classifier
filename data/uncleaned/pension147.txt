Guns in Britainjust looked on m.s.n news and 5 year old girl has been shot in London and the owner of the shop she was in was shot aswell. It seems 2 black youths were being chased by 3 black youths and ran into the shop to hide , one of the three youths stood in the doorway and just fired  several shots. I know were my wife stands on the gun issue licenced or not as her uncle was shot and killed by his best friend he was only 14. It was a total accident but she doesn't even like our grandsons having toy guns. And before the gun brigade start ,some of the worst things that have happened recently have been people who were licenced.
