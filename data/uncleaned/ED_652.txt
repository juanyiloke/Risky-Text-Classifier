Can't think of a title? SorryÊI haven't been here in quite a long time. I'm not really sure what I'm even looking for. I think I just needed a place where I could find people who understand what I'm going through. I was well for quite some time, years even since I've been like this. Back at square one. I have no idea what to do, where to go, nor do I have anyone near me who can possibly understand. It's taking a toll on my significant other, and he is loosing patience. We are both alcoholics but with my eating issues it complicates things. My alcoholism is getting in the way of my eating disorder (mildly funny if you think about it) hah. My body has a hard time getting through a work day anymore, and I just don't know how to not give up. I'm just so damn tired of hiding.
