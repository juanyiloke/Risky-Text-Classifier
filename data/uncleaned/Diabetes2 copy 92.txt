Is the impaired glucose test being properly performed ?   I have been having terrible health problems but have never scored as positive under the impaired glucose test as previously carried out by my GP.I took another one yesterday under stricter conditions and my reaction was severe - I was shaking, had to lie down, was barely able to walk and incoherent and 'out to luch' when the receptionist attemted to talk to me.Unless the test is properly and strictly performed it is worthless and there seems little doubt that many of my current health problems lie at the bottom of having had undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes for several years.I've even had an MRI brain scan to try to answer why I keep getting dizzy spells and have an appointment for ENT next week which will be a waste of their time as I await a diagnosis.I've never hidden my eating habits, which have become bizarre, but I now understand that I have developed an intuitive 'trial and error' method of attempting to control my symptoms, which will inevitably make me more ill in the long run - not that they could get much worse.If this test is not performed properly, it is of no diagnostic use. The greater surprise is that my other glaring symptoms were ignored.
