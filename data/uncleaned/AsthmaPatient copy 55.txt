Is this Asthma? Around 15 years ago I contracted pneumonia - I thought it was just a cold I couldn't shift - anyway, after being treated for it, I was then told I had asthma . Now my symptoms are: breathless on very mild exertion (ie, walking on the flat), Walking up hill is a stop and start process which I try to avoid like the plague... I constantly feel tired and weary with little energy.I've been prescribed 2 inhalers (Fluticasone +Salmeterol and Salamol, and although I do take them I don't really feel they do me any benefit. The only time I feel any semblance of alleviation of breathlessness, is when I take Prednisolone - so far that's the only medication that helps....but it's only a short-term treatment.I don't have a wheeze, although I do cough up copious quantities of mucus - when I don't have a chest infection it's a whitish bubbly stringy sputum I produce.So, my query is, is this asthma, or something else?
