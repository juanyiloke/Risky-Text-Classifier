ÊFirst Tactile HallucinationsLast night I had my first tactile hallucinations (besides ones involving sleep paralysis or hypnogogic hallucinations).ÊI felt a man with stubble bite my neck, I felt like there was gritty dirt in my mouth, and I felt a ghostly thing swoop down and land on me kind of squashing me or giving me a full body hug. I was also hearing some things, like a bit of chatter, and some crashing and clanging, but I've had that before.ÊI realized in the morning I didn't take my Geodon the night before, so that might explain it. Is it possible to have rebound psychotic symptoms from skipping antipsychotic doses, or is it more likely that the Geodon has been masking or preventing more regular hallucinations. I'm not in a mood episode right now as far as I can tell, but I don't know why I'm still having hallucinations unless I have schizoaffective.ÊI've been having kind of a lot of hallucinations lately. Like hearing people call out to me in the middle of the night at work when everyone's asleep, or hearing people have conversations between each other when they're either not talking to anyone or are asleep (or both). What is going on?
