ÊAdvice pleaseHi there,I'm new to this forum and I wonder if you could help me. I haven't been officially diagnosed with an ED but I think that I have an unhealthy relationship with food/ body image. The problem is that I can't eat, I'm not hungry ever and I forget to eat - I have to really force myself but even then it's not enough to sustain. Solid food is especially difficult, after a meal I don't feel satisfied and I'm struggling to keep it all down. Should I be concerned?I know not eating properly can affect your mental health, I have a lot on my plate at the moment and I don't want to make it worse. Do you guys have any advice?Anyway, thanks for reading!Ê
