Hello allI've never felt so helpless, hopeless in my entire life. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am on FOUR different meds and still fn depressed!! I have a 2 yr old dtr that is the only thing I can hold onto at the moment. Even that has not been so strong lately. I think about writing her a letter to prepare myself. I know it's such a selfish thing to do, but I just can't stop the feeling AT ALL. I wish I had friends I could confide in without being judged, or who even TRULY understand what I'm feeling. I intend on death by hibachi. Does anyone have any advice on this. I don't wanna hear about just don't do it. I really wanna know if anyone has lost anyone via this method, or those that didn't succeed. If there is anyone out there in BC, Canada, I would really love to hear from you!
