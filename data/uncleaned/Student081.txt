Tried Really Really Hardby Poldark00I tried really really hard on my degree, and had a 93% average mark on my first year. Then I changed campuses, the highest mark I ever got was a 65% (although the top mark for the class was something around 70%), and finally I got my final grade back - most people did a BSc option and got 100% on their final project, I did a BA option and my tutor kept telling me that I was doing really well and I should get a first, but they've just given me 30% on my final project. I'd been working in the field for nearly 4 years before I started the course, and won awards in it, and this degree was mostly a "get the letters" type deal, but I can't help but feel completely devastated. I even double checked my project with a friend of mine, who's highly sought-after and been working in the same field for much longer than I, who was convinced it was "good to go".Now I feel absolutely crushed.
