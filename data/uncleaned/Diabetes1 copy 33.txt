NostalgiaSitting in front of my pc reading messages on the forum with the radio on in the background and along comes Lionel Richie singing "Destiny". I remember it from years ago in the days when I wasn't diabetic. I'm a newby, still trying to come to terms with this condition, but does anyone else long for those carefree days when diabetes happened to everyone else, but not you? Maybe it's only affecting me as I'm still trying to come to terms with this awful condition. Perhaps in a few years I'll think nothing of it, have it totally or very nearly under control and it won't affect my every waking moment.
