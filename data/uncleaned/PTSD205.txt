Losing a Loved Oneby +trap+ » Thu May 07, 2015 8:59 pmRecently I was put on a 5250, and after leaving, I joined an outpatient group. In this group, I would like to get to the root of my issues, and get sober.My expectations were that my SO would be supportive, but she says she likes the old me better. That I have been too depressed and that my trauma happened when I was a child and that I need to get on with my life.My thoughts are to leave her, but I've trusted her more than anyone else in my life, and it hurts to let go. I know what I need to do, but maybe I'm looking for someone to talk me out of it.
