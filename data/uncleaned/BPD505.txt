ÊWhat 'triggers' your mood changes?

So, I guess I'm just curious. Do any of you have a good idea of what triggers mood swings/changes? What causes you to feel low, or high, or come back to 'baseline'?

I know that some things have an effect on me; routine, whether I get the right amount of sleep. Travel, sometimes, maybe. But beyond that I have no idea. I can be low for months in spite of feeling that things in my life are good, and when I start feeling better, it's difficult to identify anything that has changed.Ê

It's very frustrating! I feel like if I had a better idea of what causes it, it would be easier to work on changing things.
