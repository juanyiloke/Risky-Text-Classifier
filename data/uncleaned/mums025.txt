Well ds is teething.He has been dribbling for England, runny nappys and has had everything he can get his hands on in his mouth, he's also rubbing his gums with his fingers and tounge . Earlier on when I was changing him, he grabbed a wipe and bit down on it and there was a small spot of blood.I tried using dentinox gel but it didn't make a difference at all, he was getting very uncomfortable and over tired so I gave him some calpol.Any recommendations on what I can give him that works well? And any ideas on how long his will last?
