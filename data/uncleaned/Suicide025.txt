From beyondI am in such despair right now... I tried to ring my sister but she didn't answer. I have exams in a weeks time, I tried to do an assignment today but didn't even know where to start. I am under such stress and pressure, buried under it. But everyone keeps telling me I will do fine in my exams. I want someone to say I don't have to do them. I went to talk to my lecturer the other day and I cried my eyes out. She just gently touched my knee as I cried, I couldn't even look at her. I'm surrounded by people having a great time and I just feel so gut wrenchingly lonely and want to die. It's the last week of college and no asked me for a night out, I have no friends. I will also be homeless in a months time and don't know where to go. I want to kill myself but I don't want to bring more pain by traumatising my housemate...so even though I want to do it soon...like now...I have to wait a month. I want to jump off a cliff because there will be a high chance my body won't be found...I don't want a funeral, I don't want to be buried. But I will probably be reported missing if I do this and I don't want everyone to know. I don't know what to do, I tell doctors I'm suicidal and they say, see you in a few weeks, no offer of medication even. I don't know how to communicate to people the extremity of the emotional pain I'm experiencing right now. I cry and cry without end. I realise there is nothing anyone can ever do or say to properly help me, which makes it worse.
