Help for saving money!For some reason I can not seem to save money!!!I am in a reasonable paid job, Û920.00 a fortnight and pay Û200 a fortnight rent, Û220.00 back a fortnight in loans, Û50 in petrol, Û85 in ESB and every week before pay day I am left with next to nothing. This week all my wages are gone and I got a bill for my car for Û400 which was all I had saved so now I have nothing.ÊCan anyone give me some advise on what I am doing wrong ~ I don't go out every weekend, don't buy much clothes and don't live the good life!ÊI was talking to a colleague and she has saved Û4K over the summer and shes on half my wages!!ÊIs it acceptable now a days to have no savings?!!UGHHHÊ
