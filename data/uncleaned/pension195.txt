travel insurance for ex patsI have a friend who is coming out of hospital today after having minor treatment for a heart condition, unfortunately he is due to travel to Vietnam next month to see his new grandaughter. He hadn't taken out his travel insurance before he was unexpectedly hospitalized and realizes that it will now be very expensive. Anybody got a recommendation for which company to use? Also I know from experience when my husband had a stroke his insurance cover was far more expensive than mine but it didn't cover him for anything related to strokes. Why do they put the premium up because you have a medical conditioin then not give you cover for it?
