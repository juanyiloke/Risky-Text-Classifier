13.8 @ Fasting, What's that all about then ?   Hi folks, on seeing the doctor about another matter it was mentioned that i could be Diabetic; a bit of a shock as you can imagine.So off to the clinic i go the following week and get some blood taken and a few other tests done. On the day i'm told the dip tests are all normal. Yet two days later when the blood results come back i'm told in no uncertain terms that i do most definitely have Diabetes.Dr says i'm 13.8 at fasting (i.e. 14 hours after eating / drinking anything).Obviously i'm a bit freaked and to be honest a bit annoyed as i have no info on this what so ever. All the doctor said was that i'd have to watch my diet and they'd keep an eye on me for an initial 3 month period; any probs and i had to go back?I have been given an appointment to see a nurse at a special diabetic clinic, but thats not for another fortnight. So in the mean time i'm kind of in limbo with no info, no idea what to do and what not to do.Can anybody tell me what this means?I'm assuming i have too much glucose/sugar in my system so that should mean i have to cut back? OR have i got that wrong and its not about what i eat or when i eat, but rather what my body does with it and how its used?I'm open to any comments, pointers to info sites, etc.Thanks in advance,JP.
