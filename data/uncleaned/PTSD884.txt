Êchildhood traumaJust before my 6th birthday I was involved in a near fatal car accident, I was rushed to the hospitalwhere I was put on strong pain killers because I had a fractured left femur, I stopped breathing twice that night and l had to be revived. I spent 6 weeks in hospital and then I was discharged from hospital and allowed to go home, I was in a hip spiker which is plaster from my feet all the way up to my neck, I had to spend 6 weeks in that plaster which was very uncomfortable, but the worst part was having it cut off because there was a lot of plaster the saw got hot and so I got extensive burns. And then in my early teens I started to get physical illnesses because my body was still traumatised so my immunitywas affected. Then in my early twentys I started to address the PTSD with my psychologist and psychiatrist, but it's not an easy thing to talk about because it brings up a lot of painful memories, so my coping strategy is to self harm whenever I get strong thoughts or emotions.
