How do they do it ?With this austere society brought-about by draconian cuts, frozen or reduced wages and frozen or reduced pensions and benefits and a rising cost of living I wonder how the thousands of people who I see via the news-programmes find the money to form up into crowds to go fighting each-other at the sales.Either there is much more money available than they tell us there is or these people are stumbling into even more debt after a very hard year for most of us.What drives people to spend, spend, spend, when really they should be trying to save for the next rainy day that comes along ?The way things are going we might expect lots of those "rainy days" in the not too distant future !Don't you agree ?
