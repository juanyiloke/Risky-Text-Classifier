ÊHow do I politely get screened for Borderline? (United Kingdom).Hi there,Basically I've attended a few sessions with mental health professionals and the possibility of a mood disorder has been mentioned, I was given a Bi-polar mood diary, however I found that my moods changed too quickly and I didn't really have days where I could rank the whole day as one thing.I suspect borderline as when I was a child I grew up in an area where my father had bad history, all of the other children hated me because of his history, although I didn't learn what he had done till I was in my twenties. I had myself convinced back then there was something bad about me, that's why I was hated, and ever since find it hard to find and maintain friends.I know mental health professionals don't like self diagnosis, but I feel that it is worth me being screened, at worst it would eliminate one possibility. I don't them to feel like I'm telling them their job though, so is there a good way to approach this.I have an appointment with a crisis centre soon, as I recently attempted suicide, my girlfriend has to watch me till then, but it would be great if when I go to the appointment I could get them to look at the possibility, I just feel knowing is half the battle.Thanks for any help.
