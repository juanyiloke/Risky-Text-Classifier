 Appealing grades to exam boards, is it worth it?by mcgreevy1993Basically I'm a third year who sits at the border of a 2.2, 2.1.in my first term of university I lived with criminals, drug dealing, muggins, people getting arrested, fights and being broken into were a regular thing in my home for a good 3 months. living in this situation obviously made my grades drop, and after moving out in December I was diagnosed with post traumatic depression, where I suffered from panic attacks and insomnia. I was prescribed anti depressants. my grades improved (slightly) despite living out of a suitcase at my boyfriends until March. my SU said I should appeal the grades to the exam board in July, because of the situation I was living in. I have Crime reports, emails and complaints I made to the SU during the period. But is it worth the effort of appealing? Are grades usually considered after bad circumstances? Any advice would be appreciated.
