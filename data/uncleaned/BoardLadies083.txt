Any synthetic hormone free women out there?I am an oddity. Although I’m reaching the stage where contraception won’t be an issue, I have never used hormonal contraception of any kind. It’s a long story but it happened first by accident and then on purpose.Now I am convinced that this was a huge stroke of luck in my life that has altered everything. Over time I have come to value my natural cycle more and more – the incredible power of the ovulating days and the quiet at the other end of the cycle. It’s made me who I am. Without this I think I would have become a totally different person but never have known what I was missing. More and more I am bothered that I am in a tiny minority and I hate that young women are medicated and implanted before they have even had a chance to get to know their bodies.For years I have scoured the internet for like-minded information but have drawn a blank. Generally the advice seems to be that if you have a problem on the pill, just try another brand. To me this is totally missing the point.Anyway, I now have two daughters who will soon be making choices around contraception. I can’t bear to think of them choosing to switch off their reproductive systems and never knowing their full female power. Although I have talked to them about my views and experience, I’m afraid that Mum’s wacky wisdom will be no match for the combined weight of the media, doctors, friends and the pharma industry. For them and for other young women, I need more information. Is there anyone out there with similar experiences? Please tell your stories!
