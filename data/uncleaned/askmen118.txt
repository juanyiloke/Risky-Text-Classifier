setting consignment prices for fitness gear2012-05-23, 07:27 PMHey guys,ÊJust want to get some advice form some of you pros.ÊI have "limited" wholesale accounts through several local reputable independent vendors and I also run a supplement/smoothie bar in which I sell fitness apparel, supplements, and gear inside of a gym.I help other local juice bars with stocking supplement products by I offering them "on consignment" to give them a boost because I purchase at high volume and get deeper discounts. My profit margins are low but its steady flow. With supplements, discounts get deeper per volume.ÊI would like to try to expand this to shoes but I need to get a feel for setting the right consignment prices. I will set up a glass case and start with low numbers- 4 different popular m/w sneaker styles of 6 most popular sizes per style. I have several independent juice bar owners at LA Fitness locations interested in this proposal however I have not crunched the numbers yet. They can be purchase bulk or consignment.Sports Supplement discounts range from 10-40% depending on the purchase amount per brand. With shoes- my price is either 30% flat no matter the quantity for some vendors or 38-40% based on the following equation: (retail price X $.54 +10% processing fee +$2 shipping)Based on the above equation for a pair of Ladies Nikes Free Run that retail @ $99.99- my wholesale purchasing price is $61.39 each pair/ at $38.60 before expenses.For consignment, Im running with a couple numbers by maybe adding a 40% processing fee and $5 delivery. Therefore, their consignment price would be $87.99/ at $12 pbo and i would take in $26.60.ÊMy only expense initially will be driving less than 1 mile from location to location.Thoughts, questions, comments, or concerns regarding if the above numbers sound reasonable?Thanks.
