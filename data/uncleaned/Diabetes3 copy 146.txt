Structured diabetes educationAccording to NICE guidelines, everyone with diabetes should be offered structured education to help them manage their diabetes. Some of the most popular courses are DAFNE, BERTIE, DESMOND and XPert. I myself did a course a couple of months after diagnosis called 'Diabetes4Life'.Have others been on courses, and what did you think of them? Did they help you to understand and manage your diabetes? Were there any 'bad' courses that you felt gave incorrect information? Anything you would do to improve them? Do you think Diabetes UK could play a role?
