Pat on the backJust back from seeing the doctor for my HbA1c result three months after coming off the Metformin completely. 41 (equivalent to 5.9%) Really chuffed with myself. Worth every 'odd' (very low carb) meal and all the comments from my family about taking it too seriously!The doctor was very pleased - but didn't ask me anything about how I had achieved this result. I know, now, that she doesn't want to comment about the low carb diet which doesn't conform to what she is required to recommend, so she doesn't ask. Nor does she want to know about the blood testing as she has previously admitted the NHS couldn't afford to fund it. Nevertheless, I am very pleased.
