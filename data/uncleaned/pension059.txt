New Think Tank reportI'm not very pleased by the latest 'Think Tank' report (another useless one) scare-mongering that the over 60's in future will not have enough family members to look after them in their old age. For a start, not everyone ever requires care in their latter years, I can think of many older friends who didn't have 'care' or any form of support up to the day they died.In other instances, people needing care were looked after by husband or wife, often with no back-up from the State nor claiming benefits.The report was illustrated by one woman who lived at the other end of the country from her mother, and had one child to look after - hardly the most commonplace example. On the other hand, there are people with plenty of family, none of whom want to look after them if they become ill.  Yes, it could happen that anyone of us becomes ill, but it's unlikely ever to happen to everyone. What do they suggest we do, anyway: stop people getting ill?? Make them have a lot of children so the situation will be covered?
