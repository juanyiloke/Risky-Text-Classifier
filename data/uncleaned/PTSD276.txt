Unable to sleep and drinking heavily. Meds not working.by MindlessRobot » Fri May 09, 2014 6:41 amI'm on 300mg of Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) in the morning along with 200mg of topiramate in the morning and another 100mg of topiramate in the evening (at 7pm). At 10pm I take 100mg of trazadone and 2mg of prazosin (for nightmares). I also have a prescription for 25mg of vistaril as needed. While I hate having to be on so many different meds... I need them. Or maybe I don't. Because they're not working. I've gone back to drinking to help me get to sleep. My nightmares have returned. The prazosin isn't helping. The trazadone doesn't put a dent in me and it doesn't even make my eyes heavy. I know I shouldn't drink as much as I do... but because I drink my doc doesn't want to give me any benzos to help me sleep. Should I find a different doc and lie about needing to use alcohol to self medicate in order to sleep?Not only that, but the lack of sleep is starting to agitate me and I'm getting triggered more and more throughout the day. I'm on edge. Any sound is starting to set me off. I'm at wits end and I don't know what to do. I also suffer from BPD and am in the midst of a bad breakup. I really feel like I'm going to have a bad breakdown any minute now.
