forced right handedMy story is that all my life, I was born into a Chinese family as leftie and have been forced to use my right hand since a kid and have had to basically live up to the expectations of a society, which in my opinion has always been pretty critical of me. I've managed to cope over the years, but I feel that I'm really just conforming rather than being the individual I was born to be.Do others here feel the same way? If so, how could we make Australian society more understanding and empathetic rather than what I have experienced as condascending and cold.
