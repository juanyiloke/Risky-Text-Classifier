Salt, Sugar, Fat.I've just finished reading "Salt, Sugar, Fat" by Michael Moss; an account of the growth of processed food over the last century, and especially post WW2; and mostly in USAIt's a bit heavy going, but here's one quote, where he discusses the rise in obesity and other health issues, and the fact that junk food is generally cheaper than healthy food"The real question is this price sensitivity and, unfortunately, the growing disparity of income between the haves and have-nots. It costs more money to eat healthier, fresher foods. And so, there is a huge economic issue involved in the obesity problem. It falls most heavily on those who have the fewest resources and probably the least understanding or knowledge of what they are doing"Which more or less sums up a lot of opinions, including mine
