  Getting the spark back!________________________________________For the past few days, I've felt okay, not great, not terrible, not happy, not sad - but okay. I've gotten back into doing digital art, I've even been finishing up some year old stuff and the result made me smile. I feel lighter than before, I find smiling easier.I won't say I'm in a perfect spot, but I've come to the stage where I can finally look back and be proud of how far I've come. Looking ahead, there's a long way to go but I'm certain, now more than ever, that the worst is over.
