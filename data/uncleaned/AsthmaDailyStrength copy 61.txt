Since I am new to 'bad' asthma ( recently diagnosed at age 50 after going through a bad bout of what was likely H1N1/Swine flu), my most challenging thing right now is getting the asthma under control. Specifically, the shortness of breath I'm constantly experiencing, with its resultant anxiety is extremely challenging. I am beside myself with what this anxiety, extremely agitation/irritability, and compounding sleeplessness is doing. I am drinking calming herbal teas, which are soothing. I am also finding I am using a previous prescription for anxiety again (clonazepam), but oddly that isn't helping as much as the herbal product. I am talking controllers and relievers, and now prednisone. What are people doing about anxiety in situations? Thanks.
