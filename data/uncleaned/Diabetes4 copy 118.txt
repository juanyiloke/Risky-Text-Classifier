DVLA....where do I stand?So I sent my license off for renewal a few weeks back and got a letter yesterday telling me it's been revoked because my eyesight doesn't meet the requirements of reading a number plate from 20 metres and/or 6/12 on the snellen scale. But when I've contacted my GP and my dsn they both said my last appointment at the eye clinic (18th August) my eye sight meets this standard by quite a bit. I have however had my eyes lasered, my left some time ago, and my right was at my last appointment, which was some prp laser, yet my eyesight hasn't changed, just the vessels that were lasered away. So where do I stand? I've had laser treatment yes, but my eyesight meets the standards the DVLA require. So what do I do? I have no idea and I'm sure someone on here will have an idea. Please help!!
