Recovery after Pneumonia astham attack Hello EveryoneI have asthma for years but it under control to a point that I hardly need medication(Seretide). Until I got bad Pneumonia last year. That the test told me my lung age is 90 years old. My age is 40 yr old.Since then, my asthma is a lot worst. My doc change my med to Symbicort 200/400. Nowadays, I have to use it almost everyday. There is constant tight chest feeling but I can do exercise.It doesn't make sense to me. That Pneumonia is almost a year ago. My doctor told me that normal because the pus can take months to get out but it's almost a year!!Why my asthma is not back to normal before Pneumonia time?Does Pneumonia permanently damage my lung?Thank you for your time.n00dle
