asthma formoterol I am a 50 yr old asthmatic and have been trying most things to relieve asthma over the years. I commenced Symbicort 18 months ago and had very good results. however, this week I had an allergic reaction to my turbohaler/symbicort and sat in my room gasping for 5 hours!i visited my G P the following day and he wanted me to go back onto symbicort. I refused ,,,far too scary an experience and I thought the chances of the attack happening again were even greater. Anyone else had this experience?Anyone change to fostair which is similar with formoterol?cheers
