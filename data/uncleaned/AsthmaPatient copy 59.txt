Asthma vv atenolol I take atenolol to help control my heart rhythm. This has been getting worse lately and I am waiting to see the cardiologist. I also have asthma at this time of year, caused by tree pollen allergies. In the past this has been quite bad but symbicort inhalers which I only use Feb to May have helped a lot.Now, because inhalers are not compatible with atenolol I have been told to stop using them. Of course, the pollen season has now started and I am wheezing and coughing up vile stuff and it will only get worse until the pollen clears away. I cannot stop or reduce the atenolol. Does anyone know of any asthma reliever that might help? Thanks in advance.
