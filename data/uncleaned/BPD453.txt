ÊHigh ExpectationsI'm all-or-none when it comes to my relationships or friendships. As a result, I hardly let people in but, when I do, I become extremely attached and then expect too much in return. I've gotten better at this over the years but I still seem to hold people to too high of a standard.If I've let someone in and told them how important honesty is with me, why do they give me BS answers instead of just being straightforward? If I tell someone who I am there for, have bailed out of jail, that I'm extremely depressed and just NEED someone to talk to...and they say they are going to call me, blow me off for 2 weeks, and then send me picture message updates about what's going on in THEIR lives...not only does it hurt. I'm constantly checking with myself to see "Am I over-reacting, or is this person taking me for granted and being a bad friend?" I've been on both ends so much that it's hard to tell.ÊIt's so hard to differentiate from when I'm simply holding people to too high a standard and letting my BPD affect the friendship/relationship and when my NEED to have people in my life and the fact that when I care for them I do so DEEPLY leads to me giving more than I should and being taken for granted.Any tips or advice? I'm tired of being friendless and I honestly canNOT handle being alone, I don't want to be taken for granted again, and I don't want to drive good people nuts because I'm exaggerating things in my head.Ê
