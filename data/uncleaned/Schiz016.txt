Paranoid Schizophrenia, help and adviceby micro » Wed May 20, 2015 8:13 pmHi there people. Ive been reading a lot of online stuff regarding paranoid schizophrenia and stumbled across this site. It's a positive I hope. My situation is this, I was diagnosed with this condition in 2011 and have been on the recovery ever since. I have had no paranoid delusions since so the medication I have taken has helped. I get very cool dreams because of the medication so that's a bonus. However lately my body has been feeling stiff and I was wondering was this because of the medication or due to the fact that I smoke cigarettes. I can't seem to live without nicotine you see and I'm thinking that this is interfering with my medications (ambilify) to help my mood and general well being. I feel zoned out recently and I sometimes struggle to walk up hills and lose general motivation. Could this be cigarette related or is it normal to be like this while taking Ambilify. My aptitude in life is also low, I struggle with words, sentances etc. This has been the case since I was diagnosed. My quality of life is exactly great. I've lost confidence really. Can anyone help? Is anything I could do to help?
