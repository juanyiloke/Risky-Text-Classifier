TV and films with decent female charactersI am watching The Fall at the moment and I have to say it is really nice to watch something with good meaty female characters (recommend). But there are few enough out there. Thought this might be a good thread to share films and TV ( and maybe books too) where there is a normal representation of women (ie more than romantic interest or eye candy). Others I would recommend are The Killing, and The Bridge. few enough films out there though that I have seen. Please feel free to share others.Waiting for breastcheck - how to not worry?My gp referred me to the breast clinic in The Mater Hospital.Some nodules / lumps in each breast.I thought maybe this thread might be a place for anybody else waiting or where you're worried but not at a critical stage that we could help each other?Share tips for distractions, or even post your thoughts or concerns if you don't or can't share them with real life people.
