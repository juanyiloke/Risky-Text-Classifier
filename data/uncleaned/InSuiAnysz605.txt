…….Forget all the bullshit of what has happened to you and what is currently going on around you……..if you truly feel like I do its sheer ******* agony! You try to deal with the day to day bullshit and just when you think you may have made it through another day….. All of a sudden the immense anguish and despair kick in and you find yourself curled up in a ball in the corner of the bathroom floor just screaming out! If you try to stand up but the gaping holes in your body will not allow you to so you dig at the center of your chest trying to get at the very thing that is crippling you but you just end up crying louder and convulse as you have this overwhelming sensation of self pity! You scream out “Why me!” After some time you are worn out and you feel exhausted and expired. You wish you could just close your eyes and turn the light off permanently. When this happens there is nothing you can do about it. There is nothing anyone can do for you. You simply just have to ride it out.
