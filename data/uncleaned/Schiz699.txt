ÊAm I having a Psychotic episode?I am really scared that there is an alien in my apartment. I read about Psychotic episodes so I think it might be one, but I'm not sure. Does anyone know if my feelings of there being an unhuman being in my apartment me having Psychosis or a Psychotic episode? I have these feelings all the time. And I always think that even though I may not see an alien in my apartment that the alien is invisible. I think that aliens have abducted me before. Is that Psychosis? If I am indeed having Psychotic episodes all the time do I need to tell my Psych Dr? Someone please help, I'm really scared and need to know if this is just my mind messing with me.
