Had a bad episode yesterday. Was out at my mailbox when some guy in a red fleece walks by. Not sure why but I was certain the colour red meant he was surveilling me (doesn't make much sense).Anyway I ran inside and pretty much had a full on panic attack. I got chest pain and couldn't catch my breathe. This went on for about 1.5 hours. My as required medicine didn't help much so I just shut the curtains and went to sleep.So just woke up at 2am. Feel much better. Anyone else found that sleep helps?
