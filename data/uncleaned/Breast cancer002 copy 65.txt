Hair & cold cap¥	Hi guys¥	I have a couple of dilemmas.¥	Firstly I wore the cold cap to my first chemo session and my hair around my hair line has now started to fall out, I had my hair cut short before treatment, i'm undecisive whether to leave it and see what happens and how much I actually lose or cut it really short!! I'm not ready to have the lot off, even though my scalp is very painful.¥	Also my 2nd chemo session is Tuesday and i'm now not sure whether to bother with the cold cap.¥	Any feedback would be much appreciated¥	Many thanks
