New Drug?First, I want to say I'm a little hesitant about making this thread. Reason being is I don't want to over hype something, I know how it seems if something is too good to be true, then well...But every single news news outlet, radio station and people I meet seem to be talking about this new treatment non stop. After looking into a bit more, it seems like it's not just click-bait "keep on dreaming" articles, but it looks like it might be the real McCoy.Has anyone heard of it, PD 1 immunotherapy? I guess it's just finishing up in clinical trials and is likely to get approval soon. They make it seem like chemo and radiation is like taking a jackhammer to the cancer, where this is like nuking it from orbit. Is it worth talking to an oncologist about?
