I know it might sound strange for a person to say they want to die and mean it, but I do. My life as been one free-fall train wreck after another and now with the current events of my life I feel its time to make my exit. I know that this decision will hurt my family and that is a bad thing, but is it not right for a person to choose the way their life is lived or ended. The last of my joy is gone and I am nothing more than an empty shell. I wake and put on my mask to make people believe that all things are good while I scream on the inside. I pray and ask God why is my life so meaningless and he says nothing. So many times I have fallen and picked myself up, now I want to end it and say I give up. I'm tired of fighting.
