Battling on.For a while, in my head, you played silly games. I fought against you, put my face on, "THIS DOES NOT EXIST".At my lowest point,you strike once again, I cannot eat, I cannot sleep, I said "THIS CANT EXIST"Well now the facts you DO exist, I will face you head on, its not so easy, for now I see, your demons inside me.Sitting in a cafe, doing 'normal' things, I face the demons on my plate, here we go again..Guilt hits in, I cleared my plate, I feel out of control, in the mirror it laughs at me, the demons won again...So here I am, once again, avoiding cafes, avoiding meals, now I'm in control.A battle against food, depression and anxiety is really tough. Its hard to really make the demons go away..Will I ever get better??
