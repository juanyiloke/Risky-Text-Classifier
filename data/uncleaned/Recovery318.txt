Steps forwardWith depression it is very easy to focus on the bad days that are happening now. I was sitting back the other day, reading through my diary from several years back and i realised that, although I still struggle, I am so much better than I was back then. So I thought, for me and hopefully to bring hope to others, that it can get better and stay better, I am going to list things, that I can do now, that I could never do before, or at least not without a huge meltdown ...1) I can now fill the car up with petrol without having a panic attack2) I can drive the car most places, even on the motorway without any fear3) I am not afraid to try new things and maybe fail 4) I no longer care if things are not done perfectly the first time round, its enough to try 5) I sometimes say what i feel, when before I would have let it eat me up. 6) I can stand up for myself and my kids7)I am no longer scared to go to the supermarket 8) I no longer care what the majority of people think of me, well at least most of the time lol 9) I don't have constant anxiety or panic attacks every daythese may not seem big things. But they are things that were affecting my life badly. I still struggle with depression. Still have days when just getting out of bed is hard. But these are things that I have overcome and still cope with. so however bad it gets, i have to keep telling myself, that i have come a long long way
