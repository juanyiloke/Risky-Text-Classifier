The best news I could have hoped for I received a call from my consultant surgeon three weeks after Robotic Surgery (Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy) to provide me with some news related to the post-operative analysis of my prostate, seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. He informed me that that cancer had not spread outside of the prostate and there was no cancer in the lymph nodes but did show some signs of spreading into the seminal vesicles, but the fact that they had all been removed during the surgery I was therefore clear of cancer. The sense of relief was obvious but it has taken some time to actually sink in. The next steps will be to regularly monitor my PSA level as there should be no significant reading.
