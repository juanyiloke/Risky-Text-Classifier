Laminate flooring  3  I am writing because i am worried about my husband who has developed a cough over the past few months. The Doctor thinks he may have Asthma. About 3 months ago we had new laminate flooring laid in the top of the house and he seems to be coughing non stop since this has been done. I have cleaned everywhere hoovered, installed air purifiers and hunidifiers. The docotor has been doing tests and has prescribed a short course of steriods which is has been taken for about 2 days now. He was particulary bad today when we visited the shop with the laminate flooring and it crossed my mind that this may be a trigger for him. Has anyone else had this? i would be grateful for your views, i am worrying about him and he is becoming worn out. He has had chest ex-ray which is clear.
