When does your 18 month old nap and go to bed for the night? I know every baby is different but I'm finding my little one isn't going to bed till 830pm.. He still has 1 nap a day and he sleeps through the night so believe me I'm not complaining!! Just think 830 is late for a baby to be going to bed?? And he wakes about 6? 630? So it isn't like he stays up later and has a lie in?ÊSo what are the sleeping habits of your 18mo? Has anyone dropped naps all together?Ê
