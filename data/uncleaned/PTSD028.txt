Interests Or HobbiesI have been really working hard to get out and find what works for me in life. People keep telling me that I need to pursue an interest or hobby. The thing is I didn't have an environment where I could foster one growing up so I really don't know what I like. I have a few fleeting ideas but I'm so far behind the curve as an adult I could never take up those hobbies now. Do you all have any ideas for hobbies that are social or relaxing that would appropriate for an adult to start as a beginner? Thanks for you ideas!
