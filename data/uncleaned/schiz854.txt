The artificial sweetener found in diet coke, yoplait light, sugar free red bull, and almost all sugar free gum and candy has been associated with around 90 different diseases. It can cause disease, potentiate or activatedormant disorders, or even just mimic. Its no fun. If your diet includes this sweetener, i Highly suggest you remove it. You will see results, I promise you. Whether they are now or later, they will be worth it. To find alternative healthy sweeteners with no side effects 

I really want to spread the news about this additive that is detrimental to everyone's health.
