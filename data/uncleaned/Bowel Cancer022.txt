Pain 6 months after Bowel ResectionHi Guys, looking for a bit of support and advise.I was diagnosed 31st May 2014. After 9 months of back and forward to the GP,telling me it was IBS and I should see a counsellor. This is the first time I've been to the doctor for 14 years. (Other than taking the kids x). I had a sigmoid resection in June. Then I've been having FLOFOX since July.chemo hasn't quite gone to plan. I had 2 port infections that turned in to septic emai and missed 2 lots of chemo. Had to have my port removed and a new one Put in. The when chemo was finally started again I had a big allergic reaction to the Oxi, so I am now have just the 5FU via my port, over 2 days, every two weeks. At least until March.Anyway the kids and my hubby keep me smiling. Mentally I'm doing ok. More worried about them to be honest.The reason I'm writing this as over the past month I have developed this lower groin pain, around my left ovary. It's quite sharp ow and getting worse. I saw my oncologist today and she suggested doing a CEA blood test??????? And another CT scan.I just hoping someone has had similar,I'm petrified it's coming back especially as now I'm not having any Oxi.Thank you for taking time to read this.this form has been a God send as all the people in the chemo unit I go to are so much older than me,they are all wonderful people, I just feel a bit lonely ring the youngest one there.Take care God Blesslittle Mum Dent
