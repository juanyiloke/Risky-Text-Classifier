Five weeks inwell have been diagnosed five weeks ago now and after a appointment with the diabetic nurse yesterday I have been upped to three metformin a day,she said my blood pressure was perfect so that's a good start  still told not to test bloods myself yet but maybe when I've got my head around every thing.She did agree it's quite difficult to know what to do food wise for the best as there is a lot of conflicting opinions but she did agree that it is wise to keep an eye on carbs as well as cals and sugars,I was just wondering really where to start with carbs so thought I might go with 150grams a day which would be a big change to my prediabetes diet lol any tips would be greatly recieved   x
