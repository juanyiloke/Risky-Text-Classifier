ÊCopingHello,I don't personally suffer from PTSD, however, I have suffered from depression and was medicated for about 5 years. I currently try to help myself stay out of the darkness. I just started dating a man who has PTSD and I am trying to be that strong person but can feel myself breaking. I am slowly learning more about PTSD in addition he has severe depression. I hope to get a better understanding of things as I don't want my relationship to fail and I don't want to dive into a dark hole either.
