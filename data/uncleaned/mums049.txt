Hello, anyone have any practical tips for coping with an 18 month age gap? I downloaded a book on coping with two, but I'm too blooming tired to read it at the end of most days, so if you could give me the concise version that would be great!  what was your routine like? How did the older child respond to their new sibling? How did you bath two on your own? How did you manage to get anything done / make it out the house? And anything else helpful you can think of! Thanks.My son is having a struggle with learning to form his letters and I remember finding the magic pencil ("watch and learn", I think) on BBC tv really helpful in the 70s. It doesn't seem to be available any more, and I wondered if anyone else had found good ways to teach letter formation?(I don't mean suggestions like "try the iPad", but specific suggestions of apps or tv programmes or books that people know well and have used successfully.)  I'm really keen to get a Snuzpod. I am also really keen to get a movement monitor like Angelcare but I have read conflicting info about whether the two are compatible due to the solid base needed and space for wires. Has anyone used both together? Also I just saw a RespiSense monitor which you clip to the nappy - does anyone have any experience of this? Or is this monitoring experience too far!
