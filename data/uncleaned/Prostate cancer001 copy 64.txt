MRI Hi I am have been having lots of pain in last six months which was due to prostites .I visited hospital for ten time due to sever pain.Eventally,I was sent for CT scan and PSA which was normal.However, the pain carried on ...I asked .well begged for MRI.The urologist agreed and last week I had a result from my GP ...still waiting to hear from my urologist! My question is what is the meaning of this sentence ,There is some low signal bilaterally suggesting a bilateral tumour but no evidence of a capsular breach , Does this means I have cancer? I am waiting to see my urologist as he is on holiday at the moment.My GP is very busy and just told me that wait to see the urologist .I am so worried as I cannot understand the MRI wording.I will be grateful if someone kindly explain it to me.Thank you
