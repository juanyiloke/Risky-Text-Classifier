So, I don't feel as though I have PTSD from my deployments, but on numerous occasions when I knew something bad was coming, like when the inbound mortar alarm would sound, as we dropped and my body tensed up I would get this very intense metallic taste in my mouth and my head felt like it was shaken up for a split second. Since that time, any time I find myself in a near catastrophe, such as a close call on the freeway, or a landing in the helicopter that's a little too close for comfort, I experience the exact same thing; like my body isn't flinching, but my brain is. Has anyone else ever experienced this type thing, especially the metallic taste when you know you're about to get your bell rung or worse? Thanks
