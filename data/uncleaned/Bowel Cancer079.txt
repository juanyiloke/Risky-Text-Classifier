Setting up a support group.Hi everyone, where I live there isn't much in the way of cancer support groups within a reasonable distance. I'm thinking of a comfortable, informal get together where we can discuss out treatments, feelings and fears plus anything unrelated to cancer if we feel like it. How would you suggest going about creating one? I've considered creating a website hoping to catch people doing a web search like me, maybe an ad in the local paper.....just not sure what's appropriate.Many thanks in advance.Sarah
