Smear Test - Doctor's Gender PreferenceHi all, just wondering what is your preference when having a smear, male or female doctor. Reason I'm asking is I have always had a female gp do my smears but my last one was very uncomfortable and has put me off going again, but now I'm overdue. I was never too keen on getting them done but always did for my own health sake. The last smear was with a young lady gp who had difficulty finding my cervix. She routed and routed, then tried a second speculum which she snapped in two while trying to locate my cervix. The third speculum was inserted and eventually she found it. I found the whole thing very upsetting and uncomfortable.ÊSo this time I'm contemplating going to a male gp. I'm thinking he might have a gentler approach as I find some male doctors can be more sensitive than female when examining ladies. Has anyone here had a smear with a male doctor? If so how did it compare to a female doctor? TIA
