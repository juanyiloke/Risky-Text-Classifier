Not really a parenting issue, but need some inspiration from you brilliant mnetters and don't know where else to put this!My mum is amazing. We (me, DH plus baby and toddler) have been living with my parents for the past 3 months while we have the builders in. My mum has done SO MUCH for us - cooking, washing, child care, generally running around after us and all this is on top of things being pretty tough for her at the moment with my dad being unwell and very hard to live with. It's her birthday coming up and I'd love to get her something lovely to say thank you, but money is tight for us and she's not a big one for having a fuss made. She's not into massages or spa days etc and food is out as she's on a diet.ÊDoes anyone have any ideas for something thoughtful and meaningful, but not too expensive?
