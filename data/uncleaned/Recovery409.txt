  OpportunityWell while i was on this 3 day or so break from TTL, celebrating my birth saint day or however "krsna slava" is translated to English, i have gotten amazing opportunity. In my previous posts i have most likely mentioned that one of my biggest dreams is going abroad to study  or work . Well i wont go into much details in order for my anonimity to stay good, but i was offered to try and go to uni in one much better country then mine!!!!! I would have food, water and place to live there, i would just need to pay study costs which would be really small if i get into budget!!! I just need to continue learning German and need to start learning lots of stuff in order to get into that uni. I will continue studying for getting into this uni in my country to which i would transfer if this opportunity that i gained fails. My schedule will be cruel, with almost no free time. But if i put best of me into studying i will succeed. I know it!!!!!This opportunity doesnt mean success or maybe doesnt mean anything, since i can fail, but i am just amazed and thrilled that i have at least gotten this wonderful opportunity! Wish me luck!!!!!!!!!!!
