Getting Much WorseI'm really scared. I've been binging like crazy -- at least 3 times a day. I know I'm just fooling myself because purging doesn't necessarily "take out" all that I ate. I tell myself each day, each night, that this will be it, I will stop. But that has been more than a month now and I still do it, and it just escalates each day.I've tried therapy once and I don't think it was for me. It's also an added expense which I don't think I can afford right now.I tried talking to my husband about it but I just don't think he realizes how serious it is for me. I also do not want to bother him about it as he has a lot of things going on at work.I don't know who to turn to. I don't know what to do.
