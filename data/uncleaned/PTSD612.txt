PTSD Diagnosis todayPosted 2 months agoIm 27 almost 28 and was diagnosed with delayed PTSD as the trauma was 8 years ago and as the DR said ther is other things going on through hiding the trauma  but we will start today with trying a drug called sertraline for a week or 2 and then through psychologists or CPN's we will look at multiple medications for the other problems as time moves on and as i tell them more of what happened they can better understand how to treat me. chronic nightmares, panic atttacks, anxiety about going outside, bouts of anger. Anyone smiliar story or else close to this or know anything about the kinds of medications and stuff? Im hoping this is a step forward
