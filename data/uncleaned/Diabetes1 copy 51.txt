Freaking out a little...So I find myself re-diagnosed as a possible Type 2. And I have stopped my insulin (as instructed by the consultant) and am on metformin (2x500mg a day)..... as a "trial". It has only been two days but my BG is hovering around 14 and 15. I am LCHF (aiming for less than 20g a day). I feel absolutely fine but I am so worried about the long term damage that this "trial" may be causing! My DSN doesn't work Fridays through Mondays. I don't quite know what to do - wait until the metformin kicks in or take some Novorapid?
