Ds1 is 8 and the proud owner of about a gajillion pieces of Lego which he builds into complex and precarious models.Ds2 is 2 and now able to reach the handle of ds1's room, let himself in and trash the place in 5 seconds flat. He also causes much angst by coming in and trying to "help" when ds1 is playing with his Lego. I bought this but our doors are too wide, otherwise it would have been ideal .Has anyone tried anything that worked for them? I don't really like the idea of ds1 having a lock on his door (it would have to lock from the outside and the inside to be any use), but maybe there's something easy I haven't thought of.
