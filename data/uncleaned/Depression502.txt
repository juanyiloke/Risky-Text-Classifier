What Is The Biggest Thing That Depression Has Taken Away From You?Ê  coldestheart ,Ê25 Feb 2007For me my depression has taken away my hope.ÊI am probably the most synical person that is on the face of the earth. I try to look at every issue from different point of views and mostly end up thinking that there is an alterior motive to everything. I have lost my hope in humanity.I mean how awful is it that a man can get away with murdering and molesting a child by saying he was insane? It is gross that to become a celebrety you have to put out a sex tape and to stay popular you have to shave your head and break down.Not only that but i don't have any hope that my future will turn out anything like i want it to and that i should just give up.ÊI'm sure i used to have hope and every once in a while something comes along (like J.K. Rowling (SP?) turning the whole worlds children onto reading again only for the books to be made into movies basically defeating their purpose (never read the books or seen the movies)) that makes me think i shouldn't give it up but i never grasp onto it.So what has depression taken away from you?
