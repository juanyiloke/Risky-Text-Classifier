I am 17 yrs old and afraid for my life! Please help me.________________________________________Hello, I am 17 years old and I am having constant breathing problems in the last 5 months, since kid I have asthma, but all my life I was only having rare asthma attacks in the winter, nothing special, but in July of this year I started to have serious breathing problems everyday and its have been really difficult, I can't focus on school, I am always have problems to breath well and for that reason I can't do pretty much nothing. My symptoms are chest pressure, constant coughing mucus (without colour most times, sometimes green and yellow) and short breath, but I can easily take a long breath. So when this problems started I went to a pneumologist, first he told me to use a new inhaler 2 times a day and singulair, that did not helped at all, so I have done X ray, he showed that my lungs are clear, then I have done a Spriometry that have shoed 92% Fev1, 84% FVC and more than 100% Fev1/FVC. And finally I have done a blood test that have showed that I have strong allergies, that could be a explanation to the problem because when this breathing problems showed up I have started to have eczema too. I am normal guy and I have always eaten ''normal'' food, one thing that I don't understand is that I can run like 4km without stoping with no big breathing problems, besides that, I feel better in school and on the street (better but nor normal), but I feel bad in my house. I really want to believe that this is a allergy, but its possible to have allergies all day?
