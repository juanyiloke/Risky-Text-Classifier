Blunted affectHello all,I am a paranoid schizophrenic diagnosed in 2005. I have suffered from both the positive and negative symptoms of this debilitating illness. However, a pertinent problem since onset has been blunted effect: the inability to produce appropriate emotional displays using such means as facial expression and voice inflexion. I can be in the presence of someone I experience strong emotions for but my face is un-expressive and my voice monotone. This is very frustrating and socially alienating.What would the community recommend to counter the problem? Are there any appropriate self help techniques?
