Link between depression and blood glouoseI have Type 1 Diabetes.Has anyone else noticed a link between blood gloucose level and mood.If my blood gloucose level is about 5 I feel confident but when it gets above 12 ,which I know it should not be, I feel depressed, negative and have low self esteem.I find my blood gloucose levels can vary a lot as i seem to be sensitive to insulin. I take about 4 units with breakfast and lunch, and between 6 and 8 for dinner.I would be interested to hear from other type 1 diabetics
