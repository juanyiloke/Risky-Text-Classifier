Just cannot shift the weightHi,My name is Tony and was recently diagnosed with type2. Before I realised what was wrong I lost 15lbs in 3 weeks, which was a real bonus. However, since being put on medication just over 4 weeks ago I have managed just 2lbs weight loss. I ride my bike 5 days a week for an average of 1.5 hours and have cut out snacks between meals. Whats going on, at this rate I will never shift the 2.5 stones the doctor has asked me to lose.As I still work full time, fitting anything else into my day just isn't practicable. Does anyone know if metformin prevents weight loss or is it just a case of my body holding onto my body fat due to the condition.I also have the Prudential London bike ride coming up, which I entered prior to my diagnosis and readily took the glucose drinks etc to refuel, not sure if I can still use these now and whilst bananas are good, carrying a bunch for 100 miles isn't an option!!
