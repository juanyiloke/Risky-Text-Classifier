how can you tell if you're relapsing?Hi, I'm new to this forum (or any online forum for that matter) but would really love to connect with other people who have gone through similar things.I'm in recovery from depression/anxiety and most of the time feel like I'm doing ok. But sometimes, like today, it feels as if the world is crashing in again and that I just can't cope. I get really worried that this means I'm relapsing and will end up in an institution again.Is this common? And how can you tell the difference between a relapse and just a shitty day?Would love to hear from anyone even if you haven't been able to answer this question yourself.x sophy
