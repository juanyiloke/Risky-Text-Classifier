Dealing with Being Over-Defensiveby Casper » Sat Nov 29, 2014 8:32 pmLong story short, four years ago, I was on a motorcycle and was cut off by a car. I had my helmet on (for those who will ask) and wasn't speeding, but it still resulted in numerous skull fractures, neurological damage, and amnesia, plus the associated psychological damage (there were other breaks, but not relevant to this).Since then, in addition to not being able to drive directly behind a BMW (the brand that hit me), I get VERY angry whenever someone cuts me off on the road. While most people would just flick their high beams and be done with it, I will chase the person at dangerously high speeds, weaving through traffic. It's like I want them to be as scared for their life as I was that day.I don't want to be like that. I hate when I'm like that. It's almost a dissociation, for lack of a better phrase. When in the car, I don't see anything. I could fly by a cop car doing 100 mph in a 35 zone while chasing a guy and not realize it; I get that focused on my target. It's not until it has subsided, usually some time later, that I realize just how fast I'm going.I know that, other than breathing/heart beating/etc., there is no action we do that is purely "instinctive"; there is at least some fraction of a second of conscious thought. I never feel that fraction, though. It's like it has become a conditioned response in me now.I'm not a father, but my neighbour's girls are pretty much my daughters. I want to stay alive and out of prison for them, so any ideas as to how to recondition myself?
