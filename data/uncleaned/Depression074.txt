Need help fast! Hi,I'm new to these forums but I came across it whilst searching the Internet for advice and thought that you guys might be able to point me the right direction.I have suffered with very acute depression for many years which I could also handle very well. But over the past couple of years it has slowly been building up, I reached a stage in my life where I was unhappy with my job, future prospects etc. I also worked close to 300 hours per month which I guess really didn't help.Anyhow to cut a long story short I have been off work since October last year. I ended up in hospital attempting suicide, taken drugs to relieve my depression in someway, self harmed etc. A couple months back I managed to get back on my feet and get accepted for my dream job..........which I recently just found out I can't have because I have money problems.Now i'm out of work, have debt to sort etc. Now the depression has come back in a big way and i'm suffering severe anxiety attacks.ÊMy biggest problem is that no one seems to want to help me. My girlfriend doesn't understand one bit and is always arguing with me and accusing me, my parents just say get some sleep. I have been to citizens advice and they basically palmed me off and all my GP can recommend is more citalopram.I seriously want help, please what can I do and where should I go. I need help paying bills, I need help finding a new job and I need help with my drepression/anxiety. I can't cope anymore and I fear something very bad is going to happen, as I keep having sucidal thoughts and researching the best methods.ÊI really feel like no one understands and is willing to help me. So i'm hiding it from everybody, but its building up in a big way.any advice is much appreciated.
