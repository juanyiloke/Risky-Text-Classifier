Another UpdateHello all, it's been a while since I've been on here. Things have gotten significantly better. I haven't had a panic attack in week (yay!) and I just feel much less anxious. Last weekend I had about 5 attacks, though I know the causes of all of them and I'm getting better at identifying what sets me off and what makes me uncomfortable. I'm assuming the medicine has taken full affect which would probably explain why I'm so tired all the time. I hope things stay like this and maybe I can start driving again which was something that really set off my anxiety. Wishing the best to all of you.Ê-Alyssa
