ÊNever been bulimic but can't stop falling into binge/purge cyclesSo, I'm 21 and have never been skinny. I've been unhappy with my weight as long as I can remember and have tried to diet many times with little success.ÊI have purged in the past, and have gone through days where I would barely eat, but they were always spells of a day or two, weeks and sometimes months apart.ÊHowever at the beginning of last year I went on the slim fast diet, and in the first week I lost a pound a day, and stuck to it and felt amazing about myself, then the first day I got on the scales to see I hadn't lost a pound I felt like a failure, ate a whole load of rubbish and felt really guilty and then purged.ÊThen the cycle started, for the next few weeks I carried on with the diet, but would once, sometimes twice a day binge and then purge. Until I drunkenly cried to one of my housemates about it and a few weeks later I gradually started to do it less and less (although found it hard to actually stop completely). It was only when I met a guy (although it didn't last long) that I got a confidence boost that pursuaded me to stop it completely. And I did for a month...maybe two. But after breaking my ankle I started to put weight back on, and I have been going through phases where I binge and purge, or purge after dinner since then. Most months I'll do it at least once, and often everyday for a week or two, but then I stop again.ÊI seem to go quite all or nothing when it comes to dieting, or eating healthily.ÊI know all the bad side effects, and I know it's not even the best way to loose weight, but I can't seem to stop falling back into the cycle. Sometimes I just do it as it makes me feel good somehow.Sorry that the post is so long, but I'm living abroad at the moment and just feel a bit confused!
