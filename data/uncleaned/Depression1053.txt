No light at end of tunnelI've been depressed for over one month now.Ê It's not the first time.Ê I should be used to it.Ê I've been on SSRIs on and off for over twenty years now.Ê The mistake I made was thinking I could do without them - lulling myself into a false sense of security as it were.Ê I'd become interested in Buddhism and meditation as well as Stoicism.Ê This had given me hope of a way out - ergo no need for medication.Ê WRONG.Ê I spent over five weeks carefully weaning myself of my medication.Ê So far, so good.Ê I lasted about another two weeks with nothing at all, full of a supreme sense of achievement. And then crash.Ê I can only conclude that a depressed state is my default setting.Ê Either that, or the SSRIs rob you of the ability to ever again manufacture the necessary chemicals naturally.This is day 17 back on the pills and still no effect, bringing back the old, familiar feeling of being stuck beyond the point of no return.Ê Also familiar, is the feeling that the depressed thinking is right on the money, and the medicated thinking is a type of delusion.Ê For example, I really am a total screw-up - have been all my life.Ê I was a strange, sad kid.Ê Because of my neurosis acting as some kind of a demon standing between me and other people, I've ended up totally alone, and that's not likely to change.Ê The terrible lonliness I feel is completely real and not a symptom of depression, or rather, medication in someway alleviates lonliness as well as depression.Ê I know I'm not going to change; I'm too old.Ê I have nothing to look forward to except the devastation of old age.Tell me I'm deluded.Ê Tell me self-loathing is just a symptom of depression.Ê I don't think so.Ê I really am pathetic.Ê I try to dwell on the thought of all the people in far worse situations than myself.Ê This just seems to make myself and my self pity even more contemptible.Ê Yet still, I don't have the courage to end it.Ê Why wouldn't someone be self-loathing?
