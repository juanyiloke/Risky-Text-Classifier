So am I alone???????So when I was 18 I was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia / Split Personality and my illness lead me to seeing pictures, or visions in my head of brainwashing techniques of microchips, new world order, hailing our president, strange marks on my hands, voices, sounds, nightmares, violent pictures, feelings of being watched, sleeplessness, difficulty functioning in day to day life, out of body night chills, paranoia, trauma, fear, wanting to be around people who are like me --- I'm on a very high dose of medications though it just feels bold and too unnatural for this to be "Just" mental illness and these bizarre visions lead me to panic attacks, seizures, ripping my hair out, knocking my head, showering frequently, sleeping and feeling low in energy --- I've been pushed to my psychological threshold and I'm caving in .... To the world around me I'm very stoic and I was wondering if anyone else is dealing with this awful illness and was swayed to believe its some sort of "Goverment Mind Control" --- Too bold and unnatural to just only be "Mental Illness" Is there anyone out there I can bounce opinions with so as to help me through this difficult time I'm having?????
