ventolin and heart rate I am trying to tackle my worsening asthma by getting fitter, but because the exercise can often exacerbate symptoms, cause breathlessness or a coughing fit I take some precautionary ventolin in advance. This is usually effective (though not always). Anyway, even though my work is very sedentary, I had always thought of myself as not too unfit, although knew I wasn't the fittest around. However, when inputting my timings and exercise heart rate details into these online calculators in order to assess my progress, I have been shocked about how poor my figures are. It may simply be a combination of my persistent asthma and previous unfitness, and the fact that I am not very tall, so would cover distances less quickly than some in my age group…However, I am wondering whether the pre-exercise ventolin, or the seretide also, might affect my heart rate slightly, and that really I cannot compare myself therefore in 'normal' ban dings such as these online fitness calculators.Anyone have any knowledge or experience in this? Its a bit dispiriting.
