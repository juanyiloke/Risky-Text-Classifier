Talking about footballAnyone else notice that the level of detail that people go into when talking about football has got the the stage where even the most minute of details are being thrashed out in conversations?I have a passing interest in football to the extent that I played soccer and GAA until my mid teens, understand the game, can maintain a conversation if needs be and would follow the World Cup and keep an eye on "big" games. But I find that friends go into such detail about football to the extent some of them could watch six hours of games and analysis on a Sunday. It's gotten to such an extent that they even discuss who the best commentators are!!!Before posters jump in with "who are you socialising with har har har" has anyone else noticed this increased coverage of sports in general?
