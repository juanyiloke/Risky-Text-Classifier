Any causes for contstant hunger and tiredness?   Hi I'm an 18yr old male studying at Uni and I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes about 8 months ago. Everything has been under control since then, however a couple weeks ago my blood sugar levels when too high and stayed there, around 14mmol. And it's started to come down to about 5-7mmol this week.I've been really hungry for the last couple of weeks as within 1/2hr of eating a meal, I'd be eating again. Even though I have been eating I lost 4kg within 2 weeks about a month ago, but I haven't checked my weight since.Also been very tired as well, I have been getting about 7-8hrs sleep a day however find it a struggle to stay awake throughout the day, just don't feel like I have the energy to do much of anything.Had an itch over my whole body as well, it's on and off but different areas are itchy at different times, usually it's over my breasts.And finally I find it quite hard to concentrate for over 15 mins at a time, my mind just seems to drift.I was wondering what may cause this, if it was the high blood sugar or something else, my family have a history of Hashimoto's disease...Thanks in advance for any reply's
