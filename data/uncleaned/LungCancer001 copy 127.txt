Do I have lung cancer?Hi,I'm 21 years old, which is extremely young to be worrying about this kind of thing, but I need advice.I started smoking around 8 months ago, and about 3-4 weeks ago developed a dry cough that won't go away. My parents are heavy smokers, and have been around smoke since I was born. My partner suggested that I go to the doctors, so I done some research on the internet before I make my appointment.Now, I know the internet can exaggerate things, so I'm still sceptical. However, the symptoms of lung cancer are similar to what I'm experiencing:I've had shoulder pain on and off for a while, probably about 10 months. I put it down to sleeping habits and dismissed it. It feels weird. I don't have any injuries or anything. Dry cough, as explained above.Recently started losing my breath rapidly i.e. playing football. I put it down to lack of fitness and dismissed it also. Now however, I've started to find it hard to breathe when walking although it is rare.A stabbing chest pain that comes and goes. I put it down to something I ate and dismissed it.I find it hard to swallow. Food is alright, just normal saliva that I seem to struggle with. Struggle may be the wrong word, but I have noticed that it has become harder than it used to be.I seem to be good at dismissing things, however I don't want to leave it if I should be concerned.I apologise for the long post also. I would appreciate any advice.Thanks.
