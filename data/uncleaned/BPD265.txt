ÊCant handle the emotional pain!Hi everyoneThanks so much hospitalI really appreciate the assistance. I found it easily following your instructions so bless you for taking the time to do that!I cant imagine how it would be for you not even being able to see your GFÊSo sorry you have to go through that heartache because for us BPDers separation from those we love is intolerable most times! For me anyway!I am struggling now more than I ever had with these awful debilitating emotions that affect me physically, causing me to feel ill constantly and keeping me awake most nights. I require more and more meds to just manage how I feel and I hate my inability to control my emotional outbursts!I have not yet found a therapist who does DBT and no other form of counselling has had any result for me.I cling to my faith and pray I will one day find peace inside myselfFor all of you wonderful folks I pray the sameBless you all
