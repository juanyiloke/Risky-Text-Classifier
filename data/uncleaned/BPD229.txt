ÊDo I have Bpd or bipolar ??Hi,ÊI am new to this and never told anyone before so here it goes.ÊI have bursts of anger, my family ask me a simple little question and for some reason I snap and shout my answer and they always call me aggressive I don't know why I just snap. I get moment of anger when things don't go right and just want to smash something.ÊI don't like it when plans change, if my mom says we're going out I like to go and then later if she says no we're not I hate that.. I get bored very easily and I hate it.ÊI have episodes of paranoia where I think people are out to have me sectioned and if I see these people I avoid them. I get shaky and pounding heart. There's a voice in my head that starts shouting at them tell them to stay away but I scared next time I'll say it aloud.ÊI have some days where I am fine and other days where I'm depressed really moody, can't see a futur in life, I think what am I doing in life, I think about quitting uni. I do self harm during these times I just want to cry all the time. This sometimes happens when I'm out with friends and for no reason I'll just feel like I want to cry. This can last from days weeks to hours.ÊI get other times when I'm happy with life, I can't stop laughing at things even when they aren't funny. Then some days I just feel empty like there is nothing there but I'm not depressed just sad.ÊI go out spending when I know I haven't got the momey. I have always had problems with my image and about who I really am, I can never seem to write about myself in bios sometimes I'm happy with the way I look and other times I hate the way I look.ÊAnyone tell me what this is, is it bps or bipolar or something else.ÊThanks
