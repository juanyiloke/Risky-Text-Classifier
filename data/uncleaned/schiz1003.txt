Problems using nonliteral languageHey! I was just wondering if any of you here has or had problems understanding and using nonliteral language.Throughout my teens I never noticed people talk like ''I think I might be a ____.. It would be better if I didn't do ___ in that situation", in reality referring to me, trying to criticize or help me from repeating the mistakeor''Today I took a bath'' referring to using drugsNow that I do notice, it still differs greatly compared to the content of my usual thoughts (what I preoccupy myself with, my needs and worries) and the way I perceive certain situations (what actually happened, what message I tried to convey but came out wrong). I can't always tell whether we're talking of me or somebody else. Some say this means I am of lesser intelligence, however I excelled at school work, scored highly on IQ tests and won a couple logic/math related prizes.Do all people use nonliteral language, when do they start? Is this a trait of schizophrenia or some other disorder? Where can I get some insight (book, documentary, forum) into how 'normal' people form and express thoughts?Thanks very much!
