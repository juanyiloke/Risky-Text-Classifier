UGHHH! That's what I have to say today So Friday night I go to urgent care with a fever of 104 and a bad dry cough + asthma flare up. She diagnoses me with the flu and says go home and lay down. I remind her I have asthma (after just telling her I was wheezing) and that I need Tamiflu and prednisone to keep complications for arising. She writes me a prescription for Tamiflu but then tells me to get the prednisone from my regular doctor on MONDAY. I tell her I need it TODAY and she insists I get it Monday. So I was like ok fine. *fumes* Saturday my flu test comes back negative (yay) So Sunday rolls around, I can barely breath, I have some weird rattling in my chest that's new, and my fever won't go down with medication I go BACK to urgent care, get a different doctor who takes one listen to my lungs, orders a nebulizer treatment and a chest x-ray Turns out I have COMPLICATIONS FROM NO PREDISONE! I came down with fucking PNEUMONIA. So the doctor is furious at the other one at this point. I get sent home with an antibiotic, my own nebulizer, with the instructions to not get out of bed for 2 days and to go to the ER ASAP if my breathing gets worse. Yep right before Christmas! One pissed off asthmatic over here. End rant
