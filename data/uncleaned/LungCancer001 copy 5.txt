Diagnosed stage 4 lung cancer todayNeedless to say, I'm in quite a state, sick to my stomach with worry. A couple of months ago, I came down with pleurisy on my left side. Not unusual, I have a history of it going back 10 or more years. Usually lasts a couple of days and goes away. This time, it lingered. Chest X-Rays and CT scan came back negative except for accumulated fluid in the lining around the left lung. Last week, the fluid was drained and sent out for analysis. Yesterday I learned that they had found cancer cells. Today I learned it was stage 4. No tumor or mass, it's apparently on the lining of the lung. This week I will also have an MRI to see if it's spread to my brain and an Pet scan to see if it's spread anywhere else in the body.The oncologist wants to start me on Carboplatin, Taxol, and Avastin, depending on what the MRI and Pet scan reveals. Anybody got any advice on how to get emotional roller coaster to slow down????
