Possible ED?Hey, I'm brand new here. I've recently been struggling with eating and I wanted to get some opinions. Recently I feel like I just haven't been able to eat very much at all. I've been eating maybe one meal a day, and hardly being able to finish that. It's almost like as soon as I get any food, any hunger that was there just disappears and I find myself completely uninterested in eating, despite being extremely hungry minutes before.I've had issues with eating in the past, but not in the last 2+ years. I did recently go through a tough breakup, and although I don't feel outwardly sad, is it possible that this might have influenced me subconsciously?It's worth mentioning that I don't really have any weight/body image problems- I do wish I was a little thinner, but I'm not overly worried about it. I'm fairly comfortable with my body as it is.I just wanted to get some opinions about this. It honestly doesn't sound like an ED to me, but it's been going on for almost 2 weeks now so I'm getting concerned. Thanks!
