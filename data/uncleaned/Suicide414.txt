I hate my life.brokenMy husband and I have been together almost ten years. We have a beautiful son who just turned two. You’d think I’d be head over heels happy right? I’m not. My husband was raised my an abusive father. His father passed in 2013. He takes everything out on me. He’s hit me. He tells me I’m a bad mom. Tells me I’m lazy. I work four ten hour days. I cook I clean I try everything in my power to make them happy. Just today He started another argument and he said he didn’t want to talk. He is in the middle of moving on. He always acts like I’m replaceable. I have had a lot of bad things happen to me in my life. It’s all coming to a head. I just want out. I just believe that if I was gone everyone’s life would be so much simpler. I wouldn’t be here to screw things up.
