  I just moved to New York...I had to. After graduating college and living with my folks after so many years of being on my own...I just picked up whatever money i could, got a hotel room and will be sharing/subletting an apartment with two people.I feel absolutely awesome! I haven't felt this great in mylife ! Maybe I really just needed to move...because I am in the best  of spirits. It was so bittersweet moving away from home and I felt it was for the best. I just was wallowing in some negativity back  in Pittsburgh.I actually feel that I'm actually moving towards becoming a much better person now.With that said...I hope I won't have to post here again. Thanks for everything and take care.
