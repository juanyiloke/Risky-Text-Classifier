Help with stressHello ladies, was wondering if you'd be able to help me. I have been feeling very irritated as of late. I think I've pin pointed it down to maybe having pmt. it's the same pattern for me every month, two weeks before my period I am the most irritable, unlikable, stressed out person. I take my moods out on everyone, esp my poor boyfriend. I literally hate every human around me, I only have tolerance for my lovely dog. I cannot help this even though I know when it's coming. Then as soon as I get my period, I'm normal again! I see the blue skies and butterflies and feel the breeze on my skin! I'm a nice person. I laugh and have fun. Hold hands with my boyfriend, tell him I love him and I like being that person. It only lasts about a week and a half though and it's not long before I feel the dark clouds cover me again. I should add I'm not taking any form of contraception now for over a year.ÊI'm not looking for medical advice either, but if anyone knows of any natural supplements to take that help with moods I would appreciate it! Am I the only one who feels like this? I hate myself and everyone else for those two weeks. If I could spend them in silence and not speak to anyone I would. I try to really enjoy the time when I feel good again but it's bitter sweet as I know the red mist shall descend again soon! Please say I'm not the only one who gets like this?! I never used to be this bad and it has only been noticeable to me maybe in the last 18 months. Any advice? Help a sister out!
