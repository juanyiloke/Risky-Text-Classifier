return of breast cancer clustered around a clip left from my lumpectomy eight years ago¥	Hi I had breast cancer in 2006 and had a lumpectomy, lymph node sampling, 6 treatment of chemotherapy, 6 treatments of radiotherapy and Tamoxifen for 5 years. I had the all clear in 2011¥	I moved to Spain and earlier this year discovered another lump which was quickly diagnosed. After surgery i was told that there were three tumours clustered around a clip which had been left in following my lumpectomy. I had no idea that I had this clip left in, but having done some research see that they can be left in as markers. As we are told that cancer is the bodies repair system  going into overdrive, I am concerned that my cancer returning may be as a result of my immune system attaking the clip. Has anyone out there had a similar experience?
