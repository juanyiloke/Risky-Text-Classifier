double life- it's driving me crazyby kimnees » Fri Jun 12, 2015 8:02 pmHello everyone.First of all: sorry for my terrible English.I'm a girl, in my late 20's, and I was diagnosed with BPD, and I am also suffering from OCD. Which brings me to write this to you is that I have a "double life". My real life, quite painful and sad with a bad family situation, and the life I have in my mind: perfect (but I guess it'd be some kind of f*ckd-up-perfect life for "normal" people). These thoughts about my "other life" are recurrent, leading to a point of spending all day thinking about it. I do not give away my real life, but I feel very frustrated of not having this life which I can only imagine. Have any of you have experiencied something similar? Am I driving myself mad for imagining things I'll never have?K.
