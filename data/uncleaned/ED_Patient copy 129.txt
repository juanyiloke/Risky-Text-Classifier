I still dream I am binging and wake up in a panic.it is possible to end the binging purging cycle , but you have to find another way that is physically healthy, mentally I dont know if it is possible for anyone who has endured this hell to fully recover, I will never get fat I know that I have complete controll , which is what it is all about, but I also know I will never eat a fattening meat without feeling guilty as hell if I dont run 10 miles the next day.imagine how great I felt when for no apparent reason I lost a stone earlier this year ( along with other nasty symptoms), I was soon diagnosed with an overactive thyroid, I now take medication for this, which has resulted in the weight returning to normal, so in effect I now take tablets to keep weight on, ironic eh,
