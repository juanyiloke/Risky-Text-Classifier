A cautionary taleLast week a tooth cracked in half and, within 24 hours, the side of my mouth looked like I was trying to eat a tennis ball. My GP gave me anti-biotics (he's not one of those that insist you go to a dentist for everything) whilst I waited for an appointment with a dentist. I then went on a long walk with our dog. After 15k I had to sit down. I was having a hypo but the normal indicators had been hidden by the abcess and the antibiotics (tingling in the mouth and a light-headed feeling). Fortunately I had an airline sized can of coke and some jelly babies with me and, after a 15 minute rest, I was able to complete the walk. When I got home an hour later I took a reading and it was still only 64mg (I'm in France). This was my first experience of not recognising the hypo signs, because they were hidden by the abcess and medicine, but I certainly won't be going out without my testing kit and emergency glucose pen again!
