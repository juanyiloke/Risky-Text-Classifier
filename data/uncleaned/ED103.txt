Intimacy and my eating disorderHi.Very new to this.Am currently seeking help to recover from my disorder. But a new wall has presented itself in the shape of my sexual realtionship with my boyfriend. I have an intense fear of sex. I don't know if this is normal? It's like my brain and body freezes. It's probably been happening for a long time but I've been so wrapped up in my own chaos I haven't seen it.If anyone can shed any light or a pearl of wisdom I'd be so grateful.I feel so alienated.Many thanks.
