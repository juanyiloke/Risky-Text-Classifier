surprise HcA1c and off on holidayHi( i know it should be HbA1c in the title )went to the doctors for some bits and bobs as one does -- another trigger finger acting up , had a couple of episodes of light headedness over the last few months in the mornings( possibly low blood pressure with my new water tablet ) , to ask for a prostate test ( i am 56 ).so in the course of the chat with the GP he decides i should have an A1c as well as the other tests he sending me for.result back today when i went in to have the lots of fun steroid injection in my hand -latest HbA1c is 42 or old money 6.0GP immediately tells me it is too low and i should be looking more for about 6.5 -- now the funny bit is exactly how this relates to another thread in the last couple of days where you can't do right for doing wrong     on the A1c front  --  i spend the next 5 minutes explaining my zealous behaviour with regard to testing and counting my carbs and MDI........ i think he had to see it my way by the time i was done....... oh well ........................off on holiday early tomorrow morning to italy -- tuscany -- can't wait .........
