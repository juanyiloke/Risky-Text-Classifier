I'm going to changeFirst of all, i'm not sure if this is in the right place. (I wasn't sure if this should be in heal or not)Tonight i seem to be feeling pretty good, so i may as well start to do something positive while i feel like this. :-) This time last year i started a diet, i lost a good amount of weight, i felt good, more confident, some what happy. In four month i lost 3 stone, i don't know if that's good or not but i'm proud of it, but the past eight month that diet has gone to hell, eating junk food every week ect.What i plan on cutting out is snacking through the day, at the moment i don't have meals, just snack through the day, so i'm going to start eating a sensible breakfast, dinner and tea, cut out the junk. Once i lose some of the weight, and get comfortable i hope to start exersizeing like going for a jog around the estate. So, hopefuly this time next year, i will look like a different person.Why am i telling you this?I'm telling you because, i need the ... I need to tell you because if i don't say anything i will wake up tomorrow and be like "f*ck it i'm not going to bother", so if i say this now i've told some one so in a way it's (for me) like a kick in the backside to get started and stick with it, if you know what i mean.
