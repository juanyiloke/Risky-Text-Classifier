I feel like I'm doing the wrong degree?by imjustrachI came into my degree through clearing in September and I'm good at it, I'm not going to deny it and I've worked hard. However I've always had a passion for Musical Theatre and I worked hard in Musical Theatre when I studied it, though I only got a C at A Level (should have worked harder, was not in a good place ect) - I think I want to transfer. I can't transfer internally because I go to a specialist school but I want to try and go somewhere 'recognised' somewhere you won't be laughed at for studying theatre. Today I spend all my free time studying theatre wanting to know more but is transferring a good idea? Can I transfer now or would I have to try through clearing?I'm not sure, if anyone can help I would really appreciate it!- I should point out I've never applied for Musical Theatre I went into clearing for a different subject.
