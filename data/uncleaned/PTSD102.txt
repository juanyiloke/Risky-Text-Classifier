Sex Offender StatisticsIf it does not bother you, please contribute. I've read statistics (no source) that say to the effect of 60% of all sex offenders were assaulted or molested as children. I don't buy it. I think sex offenders think they're manipulative and that they can trick people into thinking they're the victim, instead of the nasty sex offender. To me that seems like it could be total bullshit. Why wouldn't a sex offender lie? And they're nasty. They like saying and doing gross things. These are people that lie to themselves every minute of their life. Some portion just imagine it, another portion thinks it makes them sound likeable, some of them are trying to play a crazy game. They're weird and I just don't trust that. My experience a has been, idiot sex offenders have heard it, and they think that makes them seem forgiving.ÊI do not mean to say that it's completely wrong. Maybe there's some margin of error accounting for liars in these kinds of studies. Does anyone else feel doubt about that?
