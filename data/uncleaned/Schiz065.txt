How do I find support?by StephieWeee » Sat Feb 28, 2015 11:58 pmI was diagnosed with Schizophrenia two months ago. At the same time, I was put on medication and can now see how crazy and far gone my behaviors and actions were. But my spouse isn't interested in it enough to provide support for me when I desperately need it. I live in Indiana and have no idea how to find support for myself. I feel so alone and am desperate to find someone to talk to. If you are interested in chatting, send me a pm.Also, any tips on how to deal with the diagnosis would be great. I feel like it's a shameful diagnosis and I can't really tell anyone out of fear of what they would think of me.
