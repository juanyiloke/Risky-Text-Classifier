Feeling so hopelessFor as long as I can remember, I never loved my body. I remember being 8 years old and praying to God at night that I would look different. When I was 13 I lost a substantial amount of weight and began to starve myself to keep losing weight. I would eat very structured meals and still feel guilty and physically sick thinking about the food in my stomach. My body snapped and I then began to binge. This continued for 10 years until I again lost a substantial amount of weight through starvation and exercise. Once again, my body snapped when I couldn't handle an emotional situation and I turned to food to self-medicate. The binging has gotten completely out of control to the point where I feel so hopeless and out of control of my OWN life. I am ashamed, embarrassed, overwhelmed, and lonely. My parents know I struggle with an eating disorder, but lately I've put on a front, lying to them, assuring them that my binging has stopped. But in truth, it hasn't. I am binging constantly and feeling so alone.I don't know what to do anymore. I know I cannot regulate this on my own...but I am embarrassed to let anyone know what I do in secret when it comes to food. Basically, I am here looking for support because I don't feel comfortable enough to tell anyone in my personal life yet. But, I really need the support of others to know that I am not alone in this disorder that alienates me from so many people and experiences. Why can't I just eat normally?Thanks for listening...it felt good to get that off of my chest. Can anyone suggest strategies, coping mechanisms, first steps toward recovery?
