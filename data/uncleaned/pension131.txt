EU REFERENDUMWhy are we denied the opportunity to vote on whether we wish to stay in the EU.   Each of the mainstream political parties promised us a referendum but when push comes to shove it is put on the back burner.  Now is the time to stand up and be counted.   Write to your MP demanding the right to a vote.   Then if we are still denied this opportunity I am prepared to go to the European Court of Human Rights to demand a UK Referendum.  After all this issue affects us all in every way we live our lives - from the economy, law and order, immigration, the way we are taxed and yes even dignity in the way we die.  Demand the vote - lets force the Government to act
