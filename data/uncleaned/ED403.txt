ÊAm I normal?For the past 7 or 8 months my life has changed an incredible amount. I have always been on the bigger side and after meeting a boy something sparked, I felt this urge to drop a ton on weight as quickly as I could. I am now I have lost and am down a lot in about 6 months, but i am still trying to drop more. I am at a normal and healthy weight for my height. A good day for me is not very many calories a day. I feel so uncomfortable and guilty if I eat anymore. On top of this I feel the need to burn off every single calorie. I go to the gym about 6 times a week where I will burn many calories. I've begun to obsess, I track all my calories, total fat intake, total carb, protien ,etc. My thoughts are consumed about what I ate, what i'll eat tomorrow, and so on. I constantly check myself to see improvements. Despite dropping a ton of weight, i still look the same, i still feel chubby. A few times this month I have restricted myself so much that I would end up binge eating, feeling like i could eat everything in sight. However, I have never purged, though i have had strong desires to do so. Is this possibly an eating disorder forming? Do I need help?
