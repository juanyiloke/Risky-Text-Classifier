esther's queendom v.2

i was thinking about the ED forum while i was hoovering earlier (i know, you're all jealous of my incredible thursday afternoon, right?) and i suddenly remembered my queendom. dunno who else remembers it, but it was the queendom of randomness, and kessa, sarah and fluffy (if i remember rightly) were my princesses. i was also thinking that a lot of people on the board were oretty down at the moment, so i've decided: the queendom is to be reinstated. anyone can join, and there are very few rules (i made these up while i was hoovering too): 1. everyone can post as much (or as little) as they want.
2. you can post whatever you want - song lyrics, thoughts, quotes, random facts, general stuff - i don't mind.
3. please please please - no 'thinspiring' posts or anything like that. i know that around 99.99999% of you won't, but i really want a nice happy cheerful fun thread 
4. anyone who particularly wants one can have a title. we already have a few princesses, but as yet no king, no princes and no other noble type people. so, applications on a postcard (or failing that, in a reply) please.

and on that note:
