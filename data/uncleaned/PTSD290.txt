Could a bad break-up cause PTSD?by reese316 » Sun Jun 12, 2011 3:08 amA few years ago I had a really bad break up. And this relationship only lasted for 3 months. But I just fell head over heels for this girl, and was just certain that she would be my wife in the future. But things went bad, We were addicted to each other, all we did was hang out with each other. I got too clingy, and scared here off. It hit me my total surprise like a freight train. It took me at least 6 months to partially get over her. I still think about her every day, so don't think I totally over it. What is wrong with me? It seems like I have a lot more nightmares now then good dreams. I used to dream about her all the time, but when i waked up and realized it was just a dream it depressed me even more. Sometimes I almost feel like i want to suffer more to prove my love to her or something. Like if i can't have her than i don't want anyone else. And i made this impulse decision to join navy ocs, and my plan was to use my hatred for her to motivate me to make it thru ocs, but by the time i got there i lost my hatred for her, and did not have any motivation to get thru the program, and I dropped out of the school, and the navy. I want to murder her one minute, then marry her the next.
