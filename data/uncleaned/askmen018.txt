Business Lingo/BS Talk2014-05-30, 12:32 PMI work in the business consulting industry. My current engagement features a very competitive environment with several other companies and firms constantly jockeying for influence and position. I was in a meeting the other day that included folks from other companies, as well as our client, and I swear this one broad was talking so much business/corporate jargon you couldn't even tell WTF she was saying. She even used the phrase, "we haven't solutionized that process yet." Solutionize? After that I started paying more attention to her speak I and swear she used the word 'solution" more times than I could freaking count. I then stumbled upon the following link which I found very amusing:[url]http://www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html[/url]Anyway, do you tend to follow the herd and use these sorts of words or do you just get straight to the point when speaking in your business establishment and has it helped you "wow" the higher ups? I have to say, I am guilty of some of this crap but as I have become cognizant of it, I try to avoid it as much as possible.DC Rising!
