I am feeling really low. This is the second nursery ds has been at, and he has been at it for 9 months. I took him out of the first as it became clear he it didn't suit him and he hated it. I was delighted when his current nursery offered him a place as it just seemed like it would be a really good fit for him and the staff are all lovely. It took him a long time to settle at drop offs, he got better, then worse for a long time, then seemed to be doing okay at drop offs, clearly a bit perturbed but not crying. But what with the Easter break and him being ill he has been off for two weeks and he is now hysterical at the mere mention of nursery. This morning his dad was going to take him to nursery. I was explaining that he was going to nursery, he was crying and gripping onto me as tight as he could. His dad managed to get him in the car seat, but he was sobbing, screaming and reaching out to me. He has been like this every day since Easter,ÊI would be a sahm in a heartbeat but we can't afford it and dh's job is very insecure.I'd he doesn't like this nursery he won't like any. I don't see that a CM would help as it seems to be the separation that is upsetting him. Nursey say he is ok in the day, but at home time now he runs to me and wants to leave straight away.I hate this. I just want to cry.ÊAnyone else been through this?
