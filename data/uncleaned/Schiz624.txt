ÊHallucinations getting worse :/i am an a schizophrenic and for a small amount of time my hallucinations had gone away, or not bothered me as much. Now my hallucinations seem to be getting worse, when in my kitchen i heard a phone ring, though there was no phone anywhere, and it couldn't have came from any phone in another room, because the ring was so loud. Like it was right next to me. Then when walking i kept feeling a presence like someone was following me though no one was there . it became very difficult for me to think, and in the same time my speech became impaired. i became very agitated, and any little thing spoken to me could set me off. me being agitated and not wanting to be around people at the moment. i went to my room and every time i would turn my back to the door or -my room- i felt like something was standing over me, at that time i started to get rather paranoid.and when i finally got some sleep and woke up in the morning i was fine. i know this was long, but i just don't understand what all happened.
