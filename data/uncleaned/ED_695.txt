I'm so scared of relapsing

I feel like I'm starting to relapse.

I've only been out of hospital since 19th September, after 5 months there.

I've lost what they say is a 'significant amount' (although it is only a small amount numbers wise). I've started skipping some things, reducing calories in meals/snacks, eating really slowly again, putting off eating. I struggle so, so much with dinner at the moment, I just can't bear eating. And I'm so anxious and ashamed if I feel like I haven't burnt off enough calories.

I'm so scared of certain foods and my head's starting to tell me I have to give up other foods up again because it's greedy, it's unhealthy, it's bad, it's unnecessary.Ê

I've self-harmed again this week, I feel so, so low and I just need to isolate myself and withdraw. I just want to go to sleep and not think about food, I just can't bear to think about it.

I'm back at uni (commuting), meeting my supervisor tomorrow about my dissertation and I have done nothing. I can't focus, my concentration and motivation is just gone. I'm so scared of ending up back in hospital and having to intermit again, but this place in my head is so awful and I don't know what to do.

Sorry.
