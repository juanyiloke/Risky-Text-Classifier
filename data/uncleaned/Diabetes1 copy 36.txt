Bruising After Blood TestHaving been diabetic now for around 6 years I am no stranger to blood tests and they have never bothered me in the past and only rarely in the past have I suffered a small amount of bruising but I had a test last week and I could feel an ache from my elbow to my shoulder while the blood was being taken and I remember thinking "this is going to leave a bruise" but then forgot all about it.A day or so later a bruise did indeed appear and got worse over the next few days, and even now 6 days later it still looks like this!!I cant ever remember having a bruise like this before and up until yesterday it was really quite sore and itchy....On the bright side I had been a little apprehensive about the results as it has been 12 months since my last blood test but I just phoned and got the results and they are all excellent still despite my not even testing myself more than a couple of times a month recently.The only slight negative is my trigs have risen to 1.4 mmol/L but theyre still in range, just higher than they have been in the past.So a great result but definitely a badly bodged blood test!!!
