Feeling frustratedHaving a more difficult time lately with Jamie having lows in the 3's, at pretty random times. This has made it difficult to work out adjustments to his insulin.Yesterday morning he woke up with a lovely reading of 5.8, having been in the 3's at bedtime and given something to bring him up. The same thing happened last night, in the 3's at bedtime so identical snacks given. This morning he was 9.8 and despite low carb breakfast and usual insulin was just over 12, 2 hours later. We just seem to have lost the patterns that we had. Luckily we have had our email from Abbott and will be getting our Libre shortly so hope it will answer some questions. Just can't tell at present whether morning readings are a re bound from being low during the night, despite snacks or Dawn Phenomenon due to getting up to pee about 6am or just one of those weird things. He continues to be on 2 injections daily which I know is not the preferred regime but our Consultant felt that it was right for him as he has learning disabilities and had an Hba1C of 5.9%. But wondering whether we might need to reconsider. Want to keep his injections to a minimum and wonder if we might persuade them to give us Tresiba as his background and then have injections for breakfast and dinner and keep him low carb at lunch. Any feedback on this idea would be gratefully received.
