Which master should I choose?2013-09-10, 03:37 PMHi!I'm having trouble deciding which master should I choose. I have a degree in Communication Science and I can't decide between Master in Communications or Master in Information Technologies.ÊMy main worry is how will I get a job with education in communications (there was a little bit of programming, media production, advertising, PR) - I love advertising and PR also newspaper/magazines work.ÊIt would be much easier to get a job in informatics, but even if I have basic knowledge of programming and web design I would still have to work and study very hard... and I doubt I will enjoy managing web pages and programming for the rest of my life.
