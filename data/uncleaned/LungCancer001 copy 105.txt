scared for my lifeMy girlfriend is giving me so much lip for posting here and swears im overreacting and a hypochondriac. Maybe I am, but I feel like talking about it here will help me tons.Now I know that being my age, 23, having lung cancer is very rare. I went to the doc for some chest pain, and they found something the size of a golf ball in my lung. After a ct scan, he told me is was most likely just a calcified lymph node and not to worry. He wrote me up for acid reflux and sent me home. I have smoked on and off for the past 5 years, less then a pack a day. Should I go to get a second opinion? I lost my mother a few years ago to cancer and im driving myself crazy.Its not that I dont trust the doctor.I just cant wrap my head around him "thinking its most likely just a calcified lymph node". The fact that he couldnt tell me for sure thats what it was scares the hell outa me. What side effects would I be experiencing if I did have lung cancer the size of a ping pong ball? Thank you all for taking your time to read and reply.
