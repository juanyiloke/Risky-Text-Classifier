Experiences of colposcopy / biopsyJust said I'd start a little thread on this issue as I was searching the net for peoples experiences on Colposcopies as I have had to go for one and I was terrified. If anyone has their own experiences on this please feel free to add as their is a lack of this subject on the net.it started with three abnormal smear tests and my GP referred me to Colposcopy clinic. I am 29, with no children and have Never really been in hospital for treatment before this, so I was petrified.ÊI took a Xanax before attending appointment as instructed by my doctor, and went into waiting room surprised at how many women were also waiting. It put my mind at ease a little knowing it wasn't just me experiencing this. I was also worried I'd have a male Doctor, as I'd never had a male before . I luckily had a female but I was soooo nervous I don't think I'd have cared in the end!!I got asked questions about my health ets and then unddressed from waist down and up my legs went onto the stirrups. My doctor inserted speculum which was uncomfortable...then some cold liquid, you get quite a chill. Unfortunately I did need to get a biopsy which I had to cough for so I wouldn't feel as much pain, and not trying to scare anyone, I found it really painful as she took 4 samples. Speculum removed and I was done.I felt really weak , faint and shaking like a leaf so I had to lie down for 20 minutes in the hospital and the nurse brought me sugary drink.I felt cramped up and sore afterwards but feeling a little better this evening.I'm awaiting results which I'll get in 4-6 weeks and I'm worried about them but will update about this if interested.at the end of the day this can save lives
