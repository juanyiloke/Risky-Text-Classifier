Continuing saga; complaint over Neil's care ! I dont quite know how to word this I am so livid ! Those of you following my story will know that in Jan 2015, Neil's daughter and I met with various representative of the local urology dept and hospital managers over our serious complaint about his atrocious end of life care.We felt we had really accomplished something, the hospital was deemed negligent and we settled back to get the meeting minutes and evidence of the action plan the department was supposedly going to have to implement.Four months later and no sign of the minutes.. Neil's daughter continually chased up the Safeguarding people to be contacted recently to be told.... the guy who took the minutes failed to record anything meaningfully. He was told to sort this out and then quit his job.The Trust management asked who was at the meeting and who had a list of action points and they refused, saying it was the responsibility of the Safeguarding people.The Chair of the meeting has pieced together the minutes and asked Beccy and I to add to or amend any inaccuracies. I am worn out with all this but at this stage, I feel we have to consider wider media involvement or indeed, legal involvement as this whole thing has been one lot of incompetence to another.Has anyone on the forum any suggestions as to how or where to proceed with this. It is bad enough coping with the grief I feel daily over Neil's death. I doubt I will ever trust the NHS, at least the local set up, ever again . Fiona.
