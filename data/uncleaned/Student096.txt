Being *underage* at uni (Pgs: 1 2)by MinaM8So I'll most likely be attending uni starting this October and I haven't really found a thread that matches my situation I'll be underage this year, and I mean fully underage, I'm turning 17 this June and I will literally be spending my whole first year at uni underage.Also I'm an international student which doesn't really help because as much as I'm super excited to go to uni, and have never had problems with being a year ahead of what I should be, I'm worried that it will stop me from having the full uni experience / that I might have some problems with stuff like rent and jobs...Any advice? Did this happen to anyone?
