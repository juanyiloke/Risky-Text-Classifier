ÊForgotten everythingHi guys... I am doing pretty well recently...my psychotic episodes are less frequent.... but I've recently realized that I have forgotten everything that I had learned in my school... I have started college again but I am finding it hard to concentrate, understand or even remember stuff. What can I do? I feel like I have lost a part of me to the illness. I feel like everything I had learned is now gone. I can't understand what the lecturer says most of the time and I find it hard to comprehend what I read. Is it a side effect of medication (olanzapine) or will it come back as I get used to the medicaion? I am really frustrated as I can't learn new things and can't remember old things. I feel so stupid....
