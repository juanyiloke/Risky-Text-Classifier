Sub-cut herceptin¥	Woohoo! Just had my 5th dose of herceptin,  and the first by injection.  How easy was that??!! So much better,  I was in and out in less than half an hour and that included extra "resting" time as my whole leg started to tingle and the nurse wanted to wait for it to stop before letting me go. I'm suffering from peripheral neuropathy anyway so one cup of coffee later I reassured her my feet were already  tingling  before I got there and my leg was now fine, and I was on my way! No more sub-cut envy by me now!! Xx
