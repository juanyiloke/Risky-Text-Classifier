I am a medical education researcher and am fielding a survey to patients or caregivers of individuals suffering from moderate-to-severe asthma to understand their specific challenges. The purpose of the research is to develop a report/publication to inform supporters of patient education of the real-world needs within the community. I am offering a $10 Walmart or Amazon gift card for complete responses to the final survey (should take no more than 10-15 minutes). Your responses will be considered confidential and not linked back to you in any way. If you are a United States resident, 21 years of age or older, and are interested in participating in this study, please follow the following link:
