Contract trouble________________________________________Not sure I'm posting in the right spot but here goes. My employer has my contract on file but has the salary wrong. I was on probation for first six months and my starting salary was34k going up to 36 k. They changed that figure after the probation period to 39k. Employed there since 2007 and recently asked to see my contract which they had on file. This contract had the original salary on it I. E was not updated to 39k. Lost my own copy of contract during recent house move. Where do I stand??? Hope someone can shed some light. By the way, was paid at 39k rate but affairs now they might say I was paid more than what it says in contract
