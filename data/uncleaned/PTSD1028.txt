About a year ago (when I was almost 20 years old) I had, what I would consider to be my most severe anxiety attack. I was already susceptible to anxiety attacks at that point but I had never experienced one like this. It began with feelings of deja vu after smoking weed with a friend in his car. I felt my chest become tighter and experienced a choking feeling in my throat. I asked my friend to take me home. Once I got home, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop the panic until I came down from being high or eventually falling asleep, so I turned the lights off and tried to sleep but I began to have these weird flashbacks of sexual abuse. I don't know if they were real or not... it just seems really odd to me, because as far as I know I don't think I was ever molested as a child. But the flashbacks were from my perspective, as if it were happening to me. I haven't had these flashbacks since, but it just has me thinking about it because I used to have a terrible problem with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in the past. I also exuded inappropriate sexual behavior at one point when I was eleven that I can remember. I've been thinking about it and wondering where my anxiety as a child came from. I also used to wet the bed often (well into elementary school).... I just don't know how it could be real without me remembering or without any of my family bringing it up if they knew or had suspicions... I was never left alone with anyone that couldn't be trusted when I was young that I could recall either. Has anyone else had something similar happen to them? I don't feel comfortable asking my parents about it because as far as I know, they didn't even know about my issues with depression/anorexia, etc...
