Is it depression?Hi, I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia almost 2 years ago. My first med(olanzapine) didn't work.. I was sleeping all day and my speech was slurry. Now, I am on new med (Sizodon plus/Risperdal)... I was also prescribed Lorazepam, but I am not taking it because I am afraid that I will become dependent on it but it does make me feel better though. Anyway, after taking Sizodon for a few days, I am having less intrusive thoughts and I am less agitated and worried. But I am still having problem going out in any social situation as I constantly think people will think I am stupid or unworthy of their time. I can't concentrate, I also always feel low, stupid and worthless. I can't enjoy the things I used to enjoy like watching movies, playing video games or reading a books. I also avoid any social confrontation, I fear I will have nothing to say and that people will think I am weird. I wasn't like that before my diagnosis. So,my question is,am I suffering from Depression ? will SSRI help (I tried Flumod and it made me restless and agitated)? or should I ask my doctor to refer me to a psychologist for therapy.
