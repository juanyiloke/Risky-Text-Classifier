Wood smoke Affect of burning wood and solid fuels on air quality Hi, just wondering what the view of asthma UK is on the recent proliferation of wood burning stoves? These give me a real problem. Two years ago I lived in an area with good air quality, now most every night is like bonfire night and I use a mask to go outside. It’s been known for many years in Scandinavia that these stoves cause pollution, and the science is well known, so I personally can’t understand why the government allows them in cities where people are living cheek by jowl and there is already enough pollution anyway. Just google “PH10” particles to see why they are a bad idea. I am not keen on cigarette smoke, and excessive amount cause me problems, but at least I can remove myself from its influence. The trouble with wood burners is that there is no escape, I came in last night after twenty minutes and my coat smelt like I had spent the evening in a smoky pub before smoking in pubs was banned. I am struggling to keep it out of my house. This is a problem that is getting worse. So, if anyone has any top tips on how to smoke proof my house please share them. Also, if anyone has any advice on if there are air purifiers be glad to hear it. Also, I think I remember years ago you could get, I think they were called “neurogena” or something that absorbed odours but I can’t find anything like that. I am hoping to “clean” the air, not just spray stuff around to mask it as I do not do well with air spray type products.
