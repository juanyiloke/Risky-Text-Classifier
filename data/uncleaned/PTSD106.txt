Facebook Upset Me

so i'm being nosy on facebook and i see a status update from a relative saying this "thank you (my abuser) for being such a pesty grandma!! i hope i become just a good as you one day. 20-30 years from now i will REALLY thank you. thanks for looking out for you grandkids. love you". this woman who has abused me, my other adopted siblings, and her own biological children is being thanked! meanwhile i'm over here all messed up in the head from this woman and seeking therapy. how do the rest of you handle this? seeing your family be all happy around your abuser(s) and you off in the sidlines with PTSD and other mental illnesses?
