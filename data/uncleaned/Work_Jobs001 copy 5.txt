In bits________________________________________I'm a registered user of boards, going unreg for this.I'm unemployed at the moment. I've a load of CV's out for a lot of different jobs and am hoping to hear back from a few soon. Basically, my problem is this.I worked for a few years in a semi state company on contract. I loved my job until I was bullied by a number of higher level management to the point where I attempted suicide. I went for counselling and its helped to a degree. Now I want to get back into the workforce but I'm terrified. I'm actually so nervous of working in an office environment again that even the thoughts of it make me vomit. My therapist says I need to just get back in the swing of things and nothing can be as bad as it was before. But what if it is? I was very, very good at my job but yet I was still treated like crap. How can I get over this fear? Social welfare are breathing down my neck and I'm sure they won't take what happened to me previously as an excuse not to look for office work. Does anyone know how I can conquer this fear?I don't know whether I should have posted this in PI or here. If I've posted in the wrong forum, mods please move to the correct forum.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!
