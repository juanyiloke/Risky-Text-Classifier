 What's up Anyone? Not going to sleep tonight to avoid nightmares.Started have bad dreams a while back but the last week has gotten SUPER SUPER BAD!!! After 2 hours and back to back things i can't stand, i just stayed up. T said my 'system' is trying to do things but it has to stop because we can't work on anything for a couple of months because of my job. Grrrr I'm NOT going to sleep again until i get to the doctor tomorrow to see if there Are any meds out there to make this stop........ oh geesh, i sure hope there is. If anyone bored or there, i will be on and off all nite! !
