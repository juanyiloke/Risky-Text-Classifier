Anger- Not For The Easily Offended.It's been a while since I've posted anything, largely due to the fact that my depression was mostly due to my situation.  Sadly the lingering issue I have is that I tend to get very angry about things.  The other day a situation arose and I no longer was able to hold it in and I lost it.  Keep in mind, I never hurt anyone or myself, no matter how angry I am.  I was chatting with my brother about some sensitive topics and it was enough to trigger my anger.   I blew up at him and after wards I felt so much better, a little bad about going off on him but I was shocked by how much better I felt after a  little venting.  The goal of this thread is to vent, scream, yell, and just get it out of your system.  If your upset and just want to go off kicking and screaming then by all means please do but before you do please use some discretion and common sense.NO ATTACKING OTHER MEMBERS-no matter what another member is saying DO NOT respond with critisizm or harsh/snappy come backs.NO ARGUING-Please do not start an argument because you've been offended. NO RACIAL SLURS or HATE WORDS.Remember, we are all here for a safe place to share our thoughts, worries, troubles, and triumphs. With that being said I'll get us started. My parents are claiming that I am an unfit parent and are now trying to take my daughter from me......I AM A GREAT FATHER!!  WHERE DO THEY GET THEY NERVE TO SAY I AM UNFIT!!!  IS IT BECAUSE I NO LONGER ADHERE TO THEIR RELIGION? OR MAYBE BECAUSE I THINK FOR MYSELF?  DOESN'T MATTER! ITS WRONG AND I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE BACKSTABBERS EVER AGAIN!!!!
