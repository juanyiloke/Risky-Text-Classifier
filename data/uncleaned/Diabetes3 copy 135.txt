Tips for a hospital stayApart from diabetes I also suffer from other long term illnesses, the major one being brittle asthma! This asthma is quite a rarer form of asthma which is severe and uncontrolled which means I spend copious amounts of time in hospital from it! The problem is that every time that I am admitted I start off with high blood sugars but then I always seem to end up having hypos, this happens every time. I think this is because to start with if I don't take my own insulin in it can take up until the next morning for them to acquire it, and also the hospital food is disgusting, I don't get a lot on the plate (being a steroid dependent asthmatic I eat quite a bit lol ) and the food for some reason makes me sick! And also the last meals in the hospital is at 5pm. Last time I was in I asked if I could have a sandwich or something to eat at supper time to prevent me going into a hypo and the nurse just told me no we can't get you anything at this time of night or I got (when my blood sugar was just 3 at bedtime) and??! This made me feel as though they were only interested in my asthma, but unfortunately as I've other medical problems I come as a package!!!I was wondering if anyone else has had any problems with their diabetic care when being in hospital for other issues and any tips of how I can combat hypos in hospital? Thank you all
