Drug reactions??Posted over a year agoI am in my late 50s and have varous health problems - I have just posted in another forum re the physical ones!!  However, I also have a post traumatic stress problem - NOT a disorder according to my therapist.  I had a 3 year battle with an employer which ended successfully for me, but has left me a wreck.  I had been taking Cipralex for the past three years but found in the last few months that it didn't seem to be working.  My doctor has now put me on Fluoxetine.  I started it two weeks ago.  The depression has lifted, but I can't concentrate, feel totally disengaged from life in general, have terrible mood swings and am constantly exhausted.  I have type 2 diabetes and Hashimoto's Syndrome, so take buckets of drugs.I wondered if anyone else had these reactions to Fluoxetine, or if you know if this drug has reactions with other drugs?  I want to get back to some sort of normality, but I feel like I am drifting through life.
