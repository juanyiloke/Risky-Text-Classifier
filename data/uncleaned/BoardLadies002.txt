Is Dianette any good form my hair problems?I'm in my early 30 and my hair started thinning last year. I have no kids yet. I have never been on a pill (only use condoms). I have some red acne scaring on my face and some facial hair growth (mostly on my chin and upper lip) - I had this problem for many years. For my thinning hair (which is main concern) I'm taking Viviscal supplements and I use Nanogen hair line (shampoo, conditioner, serum). There is improvement in regards my hair loss but no improvement in hair regrowth.My GP recommended me Dianette - this suppose to help with acne and hirsutism. So what does it mean - my hair on my chin will magically stop growing? What about my scalp? Would that affect regrowth of my hair on my head?BTW, I have done pelvis ultrasound test which went ok - there no cysts on my ovaries.I have also done blood test - my hormones level: Total Testosterone 1.5 nmol/L, SHBG 30.8 mol/L, Free Testosterone 28 pmol/L, FSH 4.8 IU/L, LH 5.1 IU/L, Oestradiol 614 pmol/L, Free T4 17.5 pmol/L, TSH 1.30 mIU/L, Iron 17 umol/L. Everything basically is in norm except my Cholesterol which is 5.2 nmol/L high.What do you think guys about my situation - is Dianette the answer for my hair loss problem?
