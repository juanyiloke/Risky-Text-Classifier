 Bullying at Universityby DannyDualscarhello! i'm going to bournemouth uni this september, which i'm very pleased about. however, at both school and college, i've been severely bullied, and i'm frightened of it happening again.i have anxiety which means i'm a really shy person. i just don't really know how to fit in or communicate with other people, and i know university life is full of parties and drinking. coming from a strict religious household, i've never done either thing, and i'm scared of not fitting in. i have no idea what to do in these situations! i'm looking just to make friends, by the way.does anyone have any hints and tips for me, for fitting in with my housemates and the people on my course? anything would be really helpful. thank you in advance!
