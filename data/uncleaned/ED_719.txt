Been sick. How to keep eating ok?I've had stomach cramps and been quite ill in my stomach since Christmas. Thankful for Christmas foods that I've been able to make my calorie intake but my stomach is still quite delicate and objects to fatty foods- I feel ill even thinking about them and have been quite gassy which doesn't help. I've been really struggling with eating- I feel sick. I'm going to try eat what I normally would tomorrow in an attempt to try get back on track. Any suggestions on how to keep from building up aversions to foods. I'm already getting quite scared of a lot of things I've eaten but trying to push against that. I'm only just starting to try new things as it is
