My DS is coming up to 2 and is deep in the hitting phase. Pretty much every day he will hit me, his dad, friends etc - then he will immediately come up and say sorry and kiss whatever body part he hits (he also does this to flowers he has stepped on )Every time he hits we always say "No hitting - that's not nice" or something similar. Yesterday he hit his little friend over the head with a toy car. I took the car off him, picked him up, said "No hitting - poor friend" - then he said sorry and they had a hug.All very good in terms of him saying sorry but it doesn't stop him from hitting in the first place! It's as though he thinks he can hit then just say sorry. Any tips or will this phase die out soon? TIA
