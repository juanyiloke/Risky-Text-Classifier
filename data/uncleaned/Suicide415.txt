when I die, I know it wipl be on my own accordGus HoskinsI want to kill myself at night and a for a few hours during the day. Then I have moments when I don’t want to. It flip flops. And I never have a reliable method when I want to. I dont have access to a car but I want to drive to a railroad and put my head on the rail when a train comes.Nothing can convince me not to kill myself, because I know I will one day, and the longer I wait the harder it will be. I will hurt more people if I wait any longer. I just want to do it know before I’m in too deep.I’m afraid of taking medicine because I don’t want to be blinded from the truth that life is meaningless. I don’t want to be told any more lies. I just want to be gone, to never have to think about anything again. Please help me, tell me the easiest way. I dont care if my body is destroyed I just want a guaranteed death that is fast.
