Spacers - volumatic v aerochamber? I've been having voice problems for ages (ie NO voice) and got referred to ENT etc They did biopsies a couple of weeks ago and at my follow-up they said i've got necrosis on my vocal cords.The ENT consultant wants me to come off my seretide cos of the high steroid content and the fact that the inhaler coats the vocal cords as the stuff goes past. I tried to tell him the seretide is the first inhaler that's actually calmed my asthma so i'm reluctant to come off it. He did say he's not respiratory so can't actually advise on inhalers / asthma, He's going to write to my GP and i've got to go back to see him toward the end of next week when he should have the consultant letter.Anyway i was thinking i currently use an aerochamber spacer with my seretide and wondered if anyone knew if it would make a difference if i used a volumatic instead? Would it make the particles any bigger / smaller, would it be more / less likely to coat my vocal cords? Basically could i get away with just swapping my spacer? As it's the preventer i'm not bothered if i have to use a huge device to take it, it's not like i might HAVE to take it while i'm in company!!!
