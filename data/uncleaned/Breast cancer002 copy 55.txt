Herceptin side effects¥	I was wondering if anyone else suffers with herceptin side effects. I finished chemo at the end of January and radiotherapy at the beginning of March. Still having herceptin 3 weekly and also on hormone therapy. I thought I would be feeling more myself by now. My joints and muscles still ache a lot especially the week of herceptin I still suffering with a metallic taste, runny nose stinging eyes and numbness in tips of my fingers. My arm swells slightly at times and is quite painful I just wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Now on top of it work is putting pressure on me to return because it is putting a strain on other staff! I've been off nine months now but the thought of coping with the job overwhelms me. I feel so down and overwhelmed by it all . Does amyone else get side effects from hercepti
