ÊPTSD QuestionsHow does one know if they have it or not? Can it also be very minor as in symptoms only occur when a certain sound or image bring on a flashback meaning a veteran won't go off when he hears a gunshot unless it is fired by a specific gun model? I keep wondering if my time and the emotional and verbal abuse I endured for years from her has given me some PTSD because I tend to not like my apartment to be too clean beacuse she'd force me to redo things over and over again until it was to her standards which it NEVER was.
