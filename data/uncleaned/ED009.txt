Giving InI was supposed to get married this weekend, but I lost my Fiancée because of my ED. What should have been a time of excitement, joy, and anticipation is instead filled with feelings of inadequacy, self-hatred, and hopelessness. What's more, I have started to push away a good friend (who also suffers from an ED) because I feel like I no longer want help in my recovery, and I cannot give her the level of relationship she wants. I have been lying to my treatment team, my family, and my friends about my habits. It is only a matter of time before they too see the futility in keeping a relationship with me.I am not strong enough to fight this. I am losing hope and have given in to many of my old habits. I enjoy seeing the numbers on the scale drop again (though they aren't moving fast enough). I want my control back, and I don't want to feel. More importantly, I want to disappear, and I know how to do that.
