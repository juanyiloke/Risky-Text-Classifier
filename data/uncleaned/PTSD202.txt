Coping without Diazepam?by CoconutIce » Fri May 29, 2015 4:58 pmHelloI'm new to the forum and hoping to give and receive support and advice. I have bipolar disorder and stress and anxiety following cumulative traumatic experiences. My mood is stable but I'm crying daily due to what I have been through. I'm trying to save my Diazepam for severe emergencies but had to take one yesterday as for three days I had been shaky and dizzy. My body was trembling and nothing would ease it. I'm starting to feel panicky when outside and don't want to go down that path. I'm frightened of losing it and ending up drunkHelp! Coconut
