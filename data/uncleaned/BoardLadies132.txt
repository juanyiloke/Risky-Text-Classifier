When your fellow single best friend finds loveHad to go anon for this...just in case.Title says it all really. Best friend has been in my life for years, she's been single for past 5 years, me for almost as long. Yeah there have been dates on and off but nothing serious. And so we've done girly nights in and out, trips away..the usual stuff.So I found out at the weekend she has met someone special. I knew she'd been on a few dates, didn't realise they were with the same person. I can understand her keeping it quiet until it got serious, she's been hurt before.I'm thrilled for her of course, but it feels kinda weird too. Like someone's taking her away from me. Anyone got any hints for how to adjust to no longer being the sidekick?
