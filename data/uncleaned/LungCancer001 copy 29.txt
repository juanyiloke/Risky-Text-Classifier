Very worriedHello. My name is Bethany I am 26 years old. I recently had a ct scan done which showed a 6cm mass in the lower lobe of my right lung. My doctor is concerned that it could be cancer. I am getting a pet scan done this coming Tuesday. I am terrified. I know there is a chance it isn't cancer but I can't stop myself from worrying. I have always been anxious and this is making everything so much worse. I can't seem to stop breaking down in tears, I can't sleep at night. I started to cough up blood yesterday and was admitted to the hospital overnight. Luckily I haven't coughed up blood since and was sent home. I am otherwise healthy so this is a huge shock. Does anyone have any advice on stopping the worrying? Even some kind words would be nice   thank you
