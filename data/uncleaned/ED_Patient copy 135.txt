I have been diagnosed as having anorexia, i became ill i...I have been diagnosed as having anorexia, i became ill in may 2004 and was at the time 16st 8lb and have always been overweight. I now weigh 8st 3lb and when i look at myself i still feel really fat even though i look at photos of me last year it doesnt make any difference. I am 45yrs old and suffered a lot af abuse as a child, sexual, physical, verble and emotional. and it was like a volcano errupting. i find it really hard to allow my self to eat even though i really feel hungry and fancy food i just cant be weak and give in to it. I have a fantastic husband who has been my rock and is supporting me in every way he can also i have 4 daughters aged 18, 17, 15,13. they have been brilliant but are all very scared of me dying. which then adds alot more pressure on me. i am being seen by several people which is starting to help but it does feel like a long and lonely uphill struggle, but feel sure i will get there eventually. they were going to put me in for a daily programe which meant i would have to go in to a local hospital 4 days a week and they help you eat meals and support you through the anxieties, But then was told i couldnt as i dont drink milk and they said i would be expected to eat certain foods and that would be one of them so i said i couldnt as it makes me sick. which seems quite bazzar when i cant eat foods i love yet they would expect me to eat foods i never eat. so as i said i wouldnt be prepared to eat milk, cream, yogert,cream cheese or custard then they said i couldnt do the programe, but they are still supporting me with help as i see someone once a week and we are slowly working through my cognative behaviours.I hope this will help other sufferers
