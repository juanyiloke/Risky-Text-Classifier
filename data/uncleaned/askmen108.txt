Trying to get a job2012-08-03, 10:09 AMI was wondering what some of you would do in this situation.ÊI worked at Best Buy as a seasonal employee for the Thanksgiving season and at the end of the season the GM of the store told me to reapply in 6 months and if anything opens up we will be glad to hire you.Well I reapplied awhile ago and recently found out they were hiring again. However, when I called to follow up on my application one of the employees told me that managers were not taking calls and would instead prefer people to come in. I went in that day and talked to a manager, I told him I used to work there before and he took my name and number and all that.It was not til I got home that I realized that my application had expired( they usually only last around 45 days). I quickly resubmitted it. My question is:ÊDo you think the manager tried to pull my application that very same day or would I be okay seeing as how I got the app resubmitted that night ?
