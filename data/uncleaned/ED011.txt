Fast Relapse...Well I started recovery on Wednesday and by Thursday evening I relapsed. Now, I don't even know if I can call it a relapse because because less than 48 hours after I started I began behaviours again...but I was sooooo recovery focused. I went grocery shopping - something I haven't done in months. I bought a plane ticket to come and stay with a friend so that I could have meal support in a new environment. I told my friends and my family and they are supportive. I want recovery really really badly.But I can't do it. Wednesday and Thursday were good, really good. I was eating. I wasn't even anxious, and I was doing okay. But then edema hit, then I found myself alone, wishing I was at home..and well I gave up. So now Im back into the lies and sneaking around. Everyone thinks Im still fighting for recovery, but nope, I'm back in the game...I don't want to be. I want to recover. I need to recover - but i can't deal with the weight gain that comes with recovery. I can't.My body feels so gross with the edema swelling. This is worse that anything the ED did to my body. I don't see the point of recovery. I'm in a dark place.That said - I do, desperatly, want freedom from this...
