How do you know?....¥	Hi All, hope your all well and any treatments are not too rough for you, but I have a question. I am now 7 months past end of treatment and am now just on Letrozole, but my question is,,, how do you know if any cancer has returned.? I have just had my first surgeons check up after a year, and all was fine, and my first mammogram after treatement is on 11 May, but they will only be checking the boobs obviously. No blood test or anything was taken and im just wondering how  would you know, I only found out this time by accident, but this question is the only thing that bugs me really now from time to time.xx
