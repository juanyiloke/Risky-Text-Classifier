ÊDoes anyone else have hallucinations that are very "simple"?I often see a lot of really simple things that I feel don't compare to what is usually described as a hallucination. I see small swirls of smoke, shadows, bug-like dots flying up close, things moving in my peripheral and often just brief flashes of dots/lines/lights. I went to the doctor and checked for floaters in my eyes and stuff like that, but she said I was fine.ÊAre these still considered hallucinations despite being more "simple"? Do you think it's possible that they will escalate in time?ÊThank you.
