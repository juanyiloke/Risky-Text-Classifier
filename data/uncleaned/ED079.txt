Lowest PointI have recently hit what I feel to be rock bottom and am about to begin partial- in patient treatment as a part of my recovery. I have never felt more ashamed and terrified in my life and I don't know how I'm going to manage my recovery. I am so afraid but I am so determined to get better and beat the disorder. If anyone has any tips on how to deal with the struggles of beginning treatment and recovery ANY advice would be appreciated because I don't know how I'm going to do this.
