  A success - who me?Emotional stabilityfeels good . Self-love feels good. Self-acceptance feels good. Ifeel good . Like I've grown into myself and my abilities, into who I am. Like I can finally stop wishing I was a different person. Like I can let go of the past, and finally appreciate the gifts that I do have.I don't know why things are clicking for me now when they didn't before. There was no magic thing that I did. I wasn't on medication , I haven't changed anything radically in my life. Perhaps it was visiting with my mom over the holidays, learning more dark secrets in our family history that show just how unhappy generations of us have been... and the futility of that mindset sinking in, finally. The knowledge that I do not have to be another link in that chain - and what better time to change than NOW, when I am still healthy  and capable ? What am I waiting for?Nothing, anymore. But I slogged through the swamps for a long  time, and I'll never look down on anyone who'ssuffering  in that place. It's a misery, and a soul-stealer, and if I have a chance to help  someone else out of that shithole, I'll be there with arms outstretched.So, you know, I'll see you around and stuff ;)
