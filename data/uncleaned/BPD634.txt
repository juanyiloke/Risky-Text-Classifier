I Have Borderline Personality DisorderSo an interesting thing was brought up to me... We tend to focus so much on the downside of BPD we don't often see the positive things. We're passionate, creative, to the point, individualistic, protective of others, empathetic, forgiving, full of love, loyal, and never boring. Of course each of these may not apply to everyone, but I think it's a good ground to start on. It does often feel like those good points are bad things because of the degree to which they're applied to whatever has our focus, but when you get to the heart of it, these are great qualities to have.
