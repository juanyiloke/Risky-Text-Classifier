Fancy Dress at Age UKWe have a load of students in the shop most days and especially at this time of the year, all hoping to find exactly what they want for their latest theme parties, today was no different. Having noticed they were all going for clothing way beyond their years the theme wasn't difficult to guess - Geriatric Halloween (!) There is also a do going on at the weekend, themed Demented Barbies and we got shot of loads of kiddie type jewellery, and anything featuring net and spangles, etc.Moral of the story is folks, please don't chuck ANYTHING away, it could be the passport to a fun evening for uni students, and make Age UK a few bob as well.
