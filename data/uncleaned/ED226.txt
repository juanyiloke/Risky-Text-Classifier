 Been doing better :)
I decided a couple of weeks ago to have another bash at eating 'normally'. The anxiety had been getting lesser which helps.
To start with it may as well have been Christmas, the lack of self control, but it's calmed down and I've been doing better. I've not counted (much), and eaten more. I have been weighing myself though, not every day, just when I feel a bit worried (I am still worried about putting on weight, but I don't want to lose any).
I'm still having some anxiety, especially by the end of the day and thinking 'I'll diet more starting tomorrow' because I feel I've eaten too much, but so far I haven't done that. 
It's a work in progress.
I wonder if I would actually like how I look more if I did put weight on? I can't imagine it as I've always hated how I look, but hey ho.
This is healthier. I just have to remember that and stop harming myself. 
Just wish I could exercise more at the mo.
