ÊPlease help! I don't know what to do (potential trigger for some people)I'm not sure if I supposed to put trigger warnings so please read with caution.ÊThis time last year, when I was depressed, I managed to get down to the lowest weight. Since then, as my circumstances improved, I went back to a higher weight and was okay there. Over the last few months, I've been relatively happy and as a result, haven't been obsessing over calories and have basically 'let myself go' - I've been overeating regularly and have gained some pounds in the last month.ÊWhen I finally weighed myself and realised this last week, I though it was going to be sick. I'm disgusted with myself and hate myself for gaining the weight. But I managed to start eating healthily again (and I mean healthily, not starving myself) and was feeling like I could cope. Then today, I went to get some juice. I drink a lot of this juice because it's sugar free so doesn't impact on my calorie allowance but I looked at the bottle today, and it turns out I bought the wrong one (not sugar free) This means over the last few days, I've drank some calories of this stuff and so, my calorie counting has been wasted and I've probably gained more weight.I feel like I've been thrown off a cliff - twice. I'm sat here crying, hating myself and my greed and I feel stuck at this weight. I'm convinced I'll end up being overweight again like I was a few years ago. I really can't deal with this anymore and have no one to talk to.
