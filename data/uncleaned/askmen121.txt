Sent the IM to the wrong person...2012-05-10, 01:15 PMBasically something happened this morning between myself and a coworker (a VP at my company) that was just ridiculous....he pretty much never pays attention to anything and he once again, proved that he doesn't.So I went to IM my coworker that I carpool with, typed out my vent, and by mistake sent it to the VP that I was venting about!ÊI didn't realize until he responded with "are you talking shit?"I tried playing it off like I was just giving him a hard time, but I think it's pretty obvious I was talking shit to someone else.What do I do? I'm not in any danger of getting fired or anything, people are allowed to vent, it's not like I called him an idiot or anything.....but now I feel completely awkward at work.ÊDo you think it's best to drop it and give it a few days to blow over? Or have I doomed our working relationship? (I don't directly work with him, so it's possible to go a few days with no contact with him, just seeing him around the office). Do guys take this as seriously as girls do? Do you think he could just forget about it and move on? Or will he harp on it..."Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't."
