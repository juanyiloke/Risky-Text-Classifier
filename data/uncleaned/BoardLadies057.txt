here for something..not sure what though :/The awkward moment you're 25, single, working in a job you didn't go to 4 years of college for..Is it bad to have not had a proper boyfriend, a first love?Is it bad to still be living at home at this age?Somewhat stuck in a little rut. No self esteem to meet the opposite sex. No desire as such..though sometimes..it gets lonely!ÊI defo need a kick up the arse. I've turned lazy and unmotivated. Don't really know where I'm going or what I'm doing with my life.ÊI'm pretty sure I was put here for something..but I can't seem to discover it :/
