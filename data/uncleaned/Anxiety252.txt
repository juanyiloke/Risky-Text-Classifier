Always thinking....?Hi everyone, I always think the worst is happening to me. it's weird, if i got a pain in my stomach I think I have appendicitis, if I get a headach I think it's a brain tumor, etc.. I told my psychologist about it and he said that we are going to start the therapy my next appt which is in like 3 days, does anyone no what this therapy will be? I also have a fear of being alone, Mostly by myself I fear but also when my mother goes away, I think it comes from when I was a child my mother was my protecter and once I started feeling this way I feel like I need to be sheltered again. I was wondering if anyone has had these feelings or these fear and how they overcame them. With the slight thought that I may have appendicitis or something else can put me into a horrible panic attack aswell as my mother or my boyfriend saying that they are going away. any ideas?
