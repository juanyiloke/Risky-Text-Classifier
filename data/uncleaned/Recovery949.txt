personal progressI feel so cocky posting this in motivational messages but I couldn't figure out where else to put it. Its more motivation for myself than anyone else but I guess I will stroke my own ego a little bit lol I'm sure after my long silence and several name changes no one has any idea who I am but that's ok. Here are some personal news from a complete stranger that will not affect you and probably seem pretty unimportant lolIn 2010 I dropped out of high school and didn't do anything for pretty much 2 years. My feeling of self worth had never been so low, almost completely nonexistant. You might be surprised but I had not expected to feel like such a piece of shit and to hate myself so much for my decision. Very recently I have finally gotten my GED now and enrolled in college yesterday   that's big news for me. I've looked at the catalogue many times and thought about what classes I would take, now its actually realistic and I'm gonna do this now. I also might be going on having fulltime status at my job. Health insurance would sure be nice to have. So yeah, you could say im a little excited
