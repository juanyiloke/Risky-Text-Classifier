I Feel Like My Whole Life Has Been A Mistake   GoldenOne , 26 Apr 2015So only about an hour ago a guy from my elementary school posted an old picture of the local football team from 2004, which I was a part of (I am 21 now, I was 10 back then).  Seeing this picture fills me with a lot of sadness. When I look at the picture, I feel sad because when I see that kid I was back then, I feel like it's so sad how I ended up. During the past 10 years, I started isolating myself more by playing video games, I have always been quite shy with the girls, and I probably developed a feeling of not being good enough over the years. When I see that picture, I just think "what happened to that cute kid?". Today I am thinking about suicide daily, I have all these terrible thoughts and feelings. I feel like I have wasted my life. Like when I see that picture, I see so much potential in that boy I was. But then I turned out to be a guy who played video games all day, didn't really enjoy socializing as much, never really felt comfortable with the girls even though I probably didn't have and don't have still. I just feel like my life has turned out so bad, and I wish I could've done it all over again and kept being a social guy and believed more in myself. It just makes me feel so sad and bad inside that it almost makes me want to cry, and nowadays I rarely cry due to lack of emotion...
