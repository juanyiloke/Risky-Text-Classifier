Hi, need some help with what is wrong with my baby. She seemed to have trapped wind at the weekend and start of this week. The past couple of days seem to be worse with crying during and after feeding and she has been sick more often, not a lot of sick at once but just small amounts after been fed. She seems to be in pain and doesn't always feed for that long, and is getting tired from crying and not going to sleep as she is still hungry.ÊSorry if I have not explained it very well, but I am tired. Does it sound like she could have reflux? I think I will go to the doctors tomorrow or ring the hv.
