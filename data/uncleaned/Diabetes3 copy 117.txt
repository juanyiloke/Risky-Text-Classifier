Beta BlockersI've been getting palpitations and pains through to my back, which my GP thinks is down to my stomach issues. Last night I was up most of the night so saw my GP this morning and he said that my pulse is too fast so has prescribed beta blockers. I am nervous about taking them, although have taken my first one as I have today off work so thought best to start them whilst I'm not doing much. I have BP monitor and it says my pulse rate is 77 so not particularly high at all. Hoping they will help but not keen really. They are not a permanent thing, just until the stomach/heartrate issues settle down.Any advice/experience of being on them?
