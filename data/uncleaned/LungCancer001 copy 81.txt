HelloDiagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC last January. Advised that I was terminal and that the only way I might possibly make a change in that status was to do Chemo and Radiation concurrently, although they wouldn't advise it because they didn't think my body could handle it.I am more interested in the quality of life than in the quantity and suggested to my onc that I would be more receptive to the radiation, alone, than to anything that might include Chemo. Received 13 radiation treatments last March, current status is one tumor growing, two tumors stable.Pathology Report indicates Invasive Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated, with sections showing small fragments of an invasive malignant neoplasm with metaplastic squamos mucosa.I was initialy given six months to live.I am currently seeking out alternative treatments and have begun making dietary changes and taking supplements. It is only the beginnig for me with Vitamin C infusion and possible Cannabis treatment being the next course of action being considered.Thank you for "listening".Flips
