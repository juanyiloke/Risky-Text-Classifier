Am I Overreacting?A little background story: I have PTSD from having been raped by a guy I was dating a few years ago. My parents and a few of my friends know about this. My father is currently depressedand has been unemployed for years. My dad has always been a guy to make a lot of jokes, and I like that about him. But lately he's been telling me jokes that make me uncomfortable and I don't really know what to do. I have told him that I don't want him to make jokes like that around me, but he just gets annoyed and tells me I'm a prude. Today he sent me another one of those jokes that I find inappropriate for a father to tell his daughter, but maybe I'm overreacting. Here's what he said:"Today a lady came to me in the parking lot. She said, 'I just had to stay and watch for a while, because wow, you have a big one!' . Turns out she was talking about my car." Am I being prudish or overly sensitive not liking him to make jokes like this? If I am, I want to know because I don't want this to stand between my dad and me. So if I need to change something, I'll be happy to do it. Especially since he's already struggling with depression and feeling worthless. I don't want to hurt him. Side note: my father has never and would never be (sexually) abusive to me in any way. He is a good guy and I know he means well. Personally, I think he is just trying to make me 'one of the guys' because he doesn't talk to his friends very often.
