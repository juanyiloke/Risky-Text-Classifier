DS1 is 10yrs old (just). He's got a happy circle of lovely friends. One close friend has recently moved to another country and he's missing him lots. So currently a little wobbly on friendships.Yesterday he told me that 'John' one of his close mates, said that there's no point in asking my son over anymore.ÊThe reason: Because I am a fun crusher. I won't let my DS1 play or watch games that have an 18 rating. John apparently has Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and some others that I don't know of. John loves computer games.ÊTherefore there's no point in my son going to play with John. It wasn't said with any malice- it's just that John wants to play these games with friends.DS1 is sad. I feel sad for him. He's now feeling excluded.ÊDS doesn't have an Xbox or Playstation. He has younger siblings so stuck with an old wii and the Lego games!I just don't want him to be playing or seeing these games especially not GTA.Yet it hurts to know he's left out.I get on very well with 'John's' parents - do I mention something to them or leave well alone?
