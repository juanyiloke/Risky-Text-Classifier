ÊMirtazapine Munchies ÊPhezzz,Ê2  Hi guys,Been on 30mg Mirtazapine for a while now with good results. Doc increased my dose to 45mg just to see if I'd reached my peak.The thing is, THEY MAKE ME SO HUNGRY. ALL THE TIME. I've put on tons of weight (I needed to - I was underweight). I'm a good weight now, but I don't really want to put any more on.ÊIt's not like going on a diet or anything would help, because it's just insatiable hunger that I was to get rid of, or attempt to reduce.I was wondering if there are any tips you guys might have? Or is there anything the doctor can give me for this?
