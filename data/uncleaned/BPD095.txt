Fitting in hereby jabberwocky » Fri May 22, 2015 9:52 amI'm finding it difficult to find my place in this forum. I can't really seem to connect with the people here, save for one or two. My BPD doesn't appear to manifest in the same way as most here and I find myself at a loss as to how to respond to most threads. There are threads that I really want to respond to, but can't figure out how without sounding like a complete ass. I think I'm more aggressive in the way I deal with things and far less depressive. As I've said before, I think my brand of BPD is tempered by my other disorders and maybe that's the difference. I've always been more comfortable in the AsPD subforum, but discussing BPD issues there is just setting ones self up for ridicule from a bunch of wannabes. Anywho...this is more of a rant of frustration than anything. I am in the process of trying to make changes in my life regarding my BPD and really would like to be more active here...just not sure how.
