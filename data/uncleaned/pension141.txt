Counterfeit £1 coinsDid you see the TV prog. on tuesday morning BBC1 "Don't get done. Get Dom".One of the subjects was the fact that the UK is swamped with dodgy £1 coins.They actually found one site where they were made. Showing hundreds of metal plates, with £1 coin sized holes punched in them.The researchers then went to five different high street banks, and withdrew a thousand pounds from each one.Out of the total of £5000. around 168 coins were found to be counterfeit. And these were issued by banks.Only yesterday. I had a £1 coin, that the Tescos automatic till refused to accept, even after about nine tries.When I got home. I compared it with other £1 coins. The writing around the edge of the coin, was very crude and rough.Another way to tell, apparently, is if the top of the 'head' and the 'tail' are not in complete alignment.As for my dodgy coin? Well what's a guy supposed to do? I, ahem, spent it, elsewhere.
