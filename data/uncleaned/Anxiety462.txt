Do big bouts of anxiety come in waves for you?Greetings, all. I have a question for those of you who have lived with GAD and/or hypochondria for a long time, but who also generally have it "under control" through therapy/CBT/medication, etc. (but of course, it's always present, always lurking). I place myself in this category.ÊMy question for you is...despite the progress you've made and the success you've had, do you nonetheless have extended periods of time (weeks, months?) where it gets the better of you and you begin to feel back at square one, or at least...overwhelmed by the anxiety and thus "off your game?" This happens to me -- often touched off by a health scare or illness -- and I'd like to hear if it happens to you.Ê
