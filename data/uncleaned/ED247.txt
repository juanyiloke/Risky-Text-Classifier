ÊAnorexic tendencies...??Back in middle school and high school I was anorexic. Now I am a thicker girl and I am extremely ashamed of my body. I feel like I still have tendencies of being anorexic. I still eat... Sometimes. I go days without eating and then I'll have a day where I eat three meals. I try not to stuff my face because of how self conscious I am. No matter how much I avoid eating I don't seem to lose weight, which is probably a good thing. I beat anorexia for the first time for a reason. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I wrote??
