Anxiety when trying to sleep and phantom painsApologies if this has been posted before or is not actual anxiety, when I described this problem to a friend they suggested it was anxiety. I have a problem that occurs very frequently, see I am very squeamish about eye gore and almost every time I try to sleep images of that pop into my head despite my best efforts to push them out and even thinking or talking about it or seeing it like in a tv show for too long makes my left eye hurt and I truly do not know what to do about it most of the time this happens when I attempt to sleep but it also happens when I try to relax as well.
