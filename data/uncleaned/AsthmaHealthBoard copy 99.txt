Scared - what do I do?________________________________________I have never had asthma before that I know of. I got a weird virus a few weeks ago and after coughing for days finally went to the doctor last Monday. She diagnosed me with bronchitis and gave me 2 inhalers, cough meds and antibiotics. The inhalers were samples. Advair and Ibuterol. She told me I could use the ibuterol up to 4 puffs every 4-6 hours. The Advair is twice a day. I mainly used the Ibuterol 2 puffs Monday Tuesday and a couple of times yesterday. I noticed today I only have 3 left on it so called to see if I could get a refill. I feel like my chest is tight and when I breath out I cough and wheeze. My dr wasn't in so the other one had a nurse ask if I could wait until mine is back tomorrow. I said no and told her there is only 3 left on it. They basically refused to call in a prescription for it. I have been trying to not use it but seriously the tightening in my chest is getting worst and coughing and wheezing worst too. I used one puff and it did not help much. What do I do? It is scary having this breathing trouble. I can breath but it just feels so tight. I have never had a full blown asthma attack so would not even knowhow to tell if I was going to have one. Any advice is much appreciated!Karen
