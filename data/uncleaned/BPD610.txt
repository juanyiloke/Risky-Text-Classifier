I Have Borderline Personality DisorderAlone With Bpd I was just recently diagnosed with BPD after a third suicide attempt. I was diagnosed as Bipolar considering my father was Bipolar and shot himself a few years ago. I am 26 years old and so far my life has been filled with pain no matter how much I try to fight it. I have been on over 24 different medication including lithium over the past five years. Almost all of the medications made the situation worse. I was sexually abused at a very early age by my father and had a chaotic childhood. I am very self destructive, even though I hide it well, and fear abandonment with all boyfriends. I am successful on the outside but experience a loneliness that there are no words for. When I am not in a relationship I have no idea who I am or what to feel. It is a struggle to make it through each day and I feel absolutely alone in my struggle.
