Being afraid of telling people what's in my headPosted 7 days agoI have had PTSD and Post natal depression for a few years. Over the last few years I have stayed out of hospital, managed things quite well...stayed safe ( no attempted suicides etc) but I have such bizarre thoughts in my head that I find it hard to tell anyone who won't just think I am mad ! For example...when someone talks about having sex I think of germs and bodily fluid exchange....if someone talks about eating particular foods ( eggs etc) and they are runny I want to wretch and be sick....I have a history of self harm ( not recently ) but do like to think that I will return to it as I like to lose blood and body parts so that it lessens me as a person...let me just say that I am well at the moment so not in any danger I just would like to explain the stuff in my head and see what others think.
