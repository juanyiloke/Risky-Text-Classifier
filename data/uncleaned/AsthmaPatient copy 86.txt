In those days of the sixties the usual reply to mycondition was &quot;Snap out of it!&quot; to &quot;It's psychosematic or he's faking it to get out of work(or play)&quot;. I went through the weekly allergy jabs and chest exercises. In my teens and early twenties I would be admitted to hospital with an attack, because I had run out of inhalers or did not manage my condition properly, several times a year. No one, except other asthmatics, could appreciate the psycological fear of expecting an attack and the distress of the physical experience of going through one and the utter relief of the nebulizer or puff of an inhaler. What amazes me today is that so little has changed and that apathy, ignorance and downright indifference is still shown by the non suffering population to this disease and that today, on a Sunday, I cannot get an emergency inhaler from the only chemists open without being on deaths door even though I bring proof of prescriptions, empty inhalers and identity documentation. I try to explain that although I am not having an attack at this very minute, I know through long experience that I will have one tonight and end up at the emergency dept. of the local hospital where I will suffer in a corner while anoverworked intern deems me bad enough to treat. Why am I told it's my fault that I have let it get this bad? How many times do I have to explain that I have tried every other option not to let it get this badbut no one takes any notice of my own personal knowledge of my condition and that I am not faking or trying to pull a fast one, I am deadly serious. Deadly being the opperative word. :headhurts:
