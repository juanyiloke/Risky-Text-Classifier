I dont want to go through this againI have been crying lately over stupid things and imagined things im on 20 mg prozac and dreading having to increase it. I have been yawning non stop (yawning fits) at times that it leaves me breathless and just dunno out of it.at times my pulse throughout my body is intenseive been worried about heart problems again what happened?? i was doing fine the only thing that i have pms like symptomsmy body has been aching all day todayi have felt really short of breath today.my anxiety comes from the fear of dying to young and leaving my babies all to themselves and its something i see pop out a lot, and to top it off  right were i live there have been a few mothers passing away on their kids and they were all young.i see it as its going to happen to us, these fears were gone but the last few days its been bad.my breathing hitching has been a concern and all my neck at times feeels like its getting scratched from the inside around the collar bone and lower throat my back has been cracking and painful to move.jaw clenching that i just cant to seem to snap out of it and its starting to cause problemsim starting to believe my body really is trying to give up on me.im starting to loose my patience again and energy it makes me think if i will ever get out of this or will it kill meyes  i know the anxiety cant kill you but its all to much and feels like my sanity wont be able to handle this anymore. (kill my spirit)i fear this is all part of something big.and the fact that i feel like i cant really talk to anyone around me about this makes me feel all shut in imprisoned by these thoughts i want to stop the tears i want to be able to be happy again. i need something to give me the hope that there is a way out that it wont lead to me being hospitalized or going crazy. who else feels this way??
