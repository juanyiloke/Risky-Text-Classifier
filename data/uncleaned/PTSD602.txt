Doctors appointment, please help!Posted 7 days agoHi, can you help with any advice? I'm back after 4 agonising days after a row with my husband over children which he's for and not realising how much he's hurting me over! I'm 42 and ready to throw in the towel over having kids, I'm one of the unlucky ones, I will have failed my marriage, as a woman and wife and human being! I'm fed up of the pressure, I'm going to see my doctor to find once and for all IF I'm doing the right thing, has anyone else been assaulted and given up hope on ever having children due to their past? What do I say to my doctor and how to I break this to my husband that our marriage hasn't succeeded because of me? I'm scared to death and I don't think my husband fully understands what this feels like, no child no marriage is basically what he said on Monday! I've lost my dad, lost my grandmother to Alzheimer's and now my mum's moved away, I barely see my friends and am going to lose another one if this is not sorted out properly!  Please help I just feel so alone!
