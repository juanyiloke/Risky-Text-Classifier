I Have Borderline Personality DisorderA lady I used to do a program with 3 years ago saw me again for the first time since. When I last saw her, I was in the midst of a major mental health mess.Now, three years later she says "I didn't even recognize you! You've lost so much weight, you look so much happier and healthier"This happened shortly after I started to get down on myself for my looks and personality and everything. God bless the people in this world who make it easier for us instead of harder.
