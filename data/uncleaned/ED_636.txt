group therapy makes me feel worseI have started in group therapy and i feel alot worse.My social anxiety is huge. I feel wrong and different and feel like i am less than the others. And i cant handle that we talk about food and weight. It makes me feel so much worse. All my self hatred explodes inside of me.ÊI feel so huge and i get triggered by looking at the other girls.ÊIt just makes me wanna loose weight, even more.ÊI dont feel like this is helping me at all. And i feel like i have to pretend that i like it. I cant make myself be honest about it to my team. They insisted that it would me good for me. And now i said i like it And i dont. I really really dont. Dont know what to do
