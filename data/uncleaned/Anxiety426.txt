GAD severely taking over my relationshipI have been suffering from GAD for nearly 5 years. Jumping from everything to hypochondriac, obsessing about the world ending, religious anxiety. Recently it has got really bad and making me ill, butterflies in belly, cant sleep, legs like jelly etc. Ive been going out with my girlfriend for nearly 5 months, everything has been perfect apart from me worrying she might be unfaithful, worried when she doesnt text back in like 3 seconds etc. However recently it has reached another level, we usually text all day and see each other about 4 times a week. The past few days she has been really dry with her texts, not replying to some etc. I asked her whats up and all I got was im fine. Shes usually very talkative starting the conversations. Now my anxiety has kicked in big time and im believing and jumping to all sorts of conclusions eg. Shes going to split up with me, she doesnt love me (even though she tells me she does all the time until these last few days), she might be cheating which I know isnt true. Can someone help me out here...im worried sick and dont know what to do. I feel so needy sending her messages hoping she replies and constantly checking when she was last online. Is she going through a rough patch, pms? I don't know. Advice would be greatly appreciateappreciated. Thanks
