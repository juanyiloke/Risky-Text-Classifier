Multiple "attacks". For some reason I woke up yesterday morning feeling awful with my chest which didn't really seem to settle all day. The tightness would ease off then come back with avengeance bringing along with it "Mr Cough" which'd settle down with salbutamol. I feel slightly better today but I keep having these repeated attack type of things with awful chest tightness and coughing, at the same time it feels like I can't breathe in or out properly which makes getting salbutamol in properly rather difficult. I had 8 5mg prednisolone tablets left from an old course which I took this morning but doesn't seem to have done much (usually helps with tightness within a few hours in previous experience.)I intend on going to see my GP tomorrow, in the meantime is there anything I can do to help myself out when my inhalers don't fully seem to be working but I don't feel unwell enough to need the hospital at the moment?Many thanks,Emma.
