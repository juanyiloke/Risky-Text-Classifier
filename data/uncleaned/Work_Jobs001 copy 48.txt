P45________________________________________I have just landed a new job and will start salary negotiations next week. However, when the recruiter asked my current base salary, I upped a bit from my actual salary (as I assume most of the people do).Now, it's a small Irish company and I've started worrying about them finding out my actual salary from my P45, which will put me in a very awkward position.Is there any way around this, can I deal directly with revenue or do I have to submit my P45 to my new employer?
