And MRI Head and Neck.Been offered antidepressants although I don't feel anxious or depressed I do feel constantly edge. And feel that I might of develop health anxiety due to the symptoms im experiencing.

I'm starting to feel insane..I am enrolling in counselling with my first session starting on Wednesday evening to expore and to give rationale towards thought process. Thank you for reading commets would be greatly appreciated.
