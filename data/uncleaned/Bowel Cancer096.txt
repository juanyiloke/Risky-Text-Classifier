Finding it hard - anyone else?I'm sorry I haven't been posting for a while. I do come along and read the posts, so oddly I feel up to date with all the goings on on bbc.The reason I haven't been posting is because I have been finding all this bowel cancer a load of bollocks. It's been so hard lately. I come on here and find others going downhill or worse, gone, and I guess it makes me remember that I'm not that far behind on the road. I hate that this stupid cancer takes people I have conversed with on here, liked, thought well of, then suddenly they aren't here anymore.I apologise, behind my words I have a deep sense of sadness about all of this and I don't know where else I can vent where people will truly understand. My inclination is to wrap myself up and try and disappear. The old, if I can't see you, you can't see me thing children do. I need to shake the feeling as it is digging into my everyday life, and my youngest son (age 12) gets affected by my moods too easily.But all I can think to do is write, 'this sucks' over and over again.
