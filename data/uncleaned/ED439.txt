ÊI don't fit into these categoriesI'm diagnosed as EDNOS. At least that's what it used to be called. Now it's OSFED. Anyway I couldn't find a section to post under so I made one. Within the last couple of weeks I have been having a bit of a setback I guess you would say.(trigger)I have been craving cold liquids and not food. When I saw that I lost several pounds in doing so, I purposely started to go back to restricting. Basically my main nutrition comes from diet pop, 1% milk, apple juice and water. With a little fruit thrown in. I'm supposed to spend this weekend with my boyfriend and he doesn't like when I restrict so I'm stressed out cuz I don't know what I'm going to do. I've grown quite accustomed to the way I eat now. I don't wish to cause a fight or worry him or my best friend who will also be there. Logically I know I should just suck it up and eat for two days. It won't kill me. The ED part says "it might as well". I'm totally stressed out and yet, I somehow miss the craziness. I don't know what I'm going to do yet(/trigger).
