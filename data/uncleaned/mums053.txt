I'm really lucky in that there are a large number of baby classes at community centres and libraries where I live. The issue I have is that they all run from 10am or 11am and my 12week old's 'routine' is to wake/nappy change/feed around 6:30am (give or take) and then a nap again until 9:30-10am (so I get a lie-in too...!!) but makes it difficult to get to the classes in time.Should I be foregoing my lie-in to be up, showered and breakfasted in time for her 2nd feed so we can head out as soon as she's finishing feeding? Why are there no afternoon classes? Grrrr!!
