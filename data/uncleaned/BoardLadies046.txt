Preventing CystitisHi LadiesNot looking for medical advice just for some personal experience.So as the title suggests I have a big problem with recurring cystitis :/ I am in a relatively new relationship which is long distance. As you can imagine we enjoy our time together but by the end of it I have terrible cystitis which seriously kills the mood! I've tried the usual hygiene and peeling after sex but I always end up having to take antibiotics/cystapruine.Im seeing my boyfriend next week and I'm just wondering do you gals have any tips on how to prevent this even happening? I'd love to be able to prevent than have to treat. Thanks in advance!
