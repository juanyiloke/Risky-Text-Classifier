mobile phone while drivingI note that the Chief Constable of Gloucestershire has called for a driving ban on people using a mobile phone while driving ( my pet hate ), it was met with a poor response from ministers, instead of accepting that they have done absolutely  nothing to grips with the increasing problem, he has blamed the police, saying they should be getting out more and catching the culprits, but is it not them that have cut police numbers, this is so typical of the sloping shoulder brigade.
