Surgery over, verdict is in :(I had a left upper lobectomy 12/9/2013 via VATS, the 2-3cm lesion is adenocarcinoma and an adjacent node is positive. Having said that the cancer that was confined to the chest is GONE, the surgical oncologist recommends I have adjuvant chemo and possibly radiation in 4-6 weeks when I am recovered.She presented my case last week at the tumor board, found 2radiation once who also had patients with cancer mets to the EYE, one from prostate, one from breast, these cases are very RARE not sure how much they know about it. Seeing medical onc soon as well as radiation onc, hoping they can work together with ocular onc I have already seenHome yesterday after 5 days in ICU with " burning knives" aka chest tubes, doing much better since.Nancy
