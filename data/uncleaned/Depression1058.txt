unstable...hey so I don't know how this works but I just need to talk to someone...I'm feeling downright useless, I don't know why I wake up in the morning and have been thinking dark thoughts lately. I'm frustrated and angry with myself and my lack of motivation or direction. I find myself bursting into tears at the slightest emotional prompt. I was seeing a psych for awhile but stopped going because he didn't even listen, just stared at me blankly and put me on more medication... I don't know who I am, who I want to be or what I want to do with my life. guess I'd like some reassurance that it's not all pointless
