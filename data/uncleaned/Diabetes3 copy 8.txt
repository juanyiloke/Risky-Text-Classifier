ToenailsHello allin around 6 hours I shall be a few ounces lighter...at lastSadly not by dietBit the bullet and agreed to have both big toe nails removedMay be partial which was part of the deal to allow `them` to do something as I at first refused to have anything removedHave come round to he idea of losing the whole nail, the thinking being that with me if anything can go wrong IT WILL, so get rid in one goSo will advise them of change of mind to their first option and see what happensQuestion isWho has had nails removed in fairly recent years as told methods have changed, and how did you get on with a return to normal foot life ?More good news, NOT  All this after my GP downgraded my foot care to low risk just over a year ago
