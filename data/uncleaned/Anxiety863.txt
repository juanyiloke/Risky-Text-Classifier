ÊKalmsAs I have said on here before I tried anti-anxiety meds (beta-blockers?) but these sent me into depression and I literally couldn't get myself out of the bed! The Dr then prescribed anti-depressants, but I have chosen not to take them as I genuinely don't think I have depression (apart from when I was taking the other meds). My next appointment is not for another 2 weeks so today I bought myself some Kalms to see if this will help achieve anything. Can anyone give me any opinions or experience of these? Thanks x
