it's out of control ... help I'm desparate please________________________________________I've been having breathing problems all this year but the last 3 weeks have been horrible. I have trouble breathing 24/7 and have asthma attacks everyday. I'm on an inhaler, prednisone, antibiotics , and clariton and nothing is working. I'm very affraid and anxious and worried that this is so out of control that its going to kill me.Why isn't any of this helping at all? I startes my prednisone 3 days ago and my antibiotics yesterday. I've also have blood work, a ekg, and chest xray that came back clear.What should I do? I'm at my wits end.
