 Tuition fee trouble...by YanyulHi, everyone. I am taking a gap year (currently working as a volunteer to gain working experiences) and going to study year 1 this coming September. This morning, I have looked at the general election result and found out that Conservative has dominant. This makes me worry because with Conservative being dominant this means the tuition fee will stay as 9000 pounds. Honestly, I come from working class and my family does not earn much. With the conservative being dominant, my family will not be able to afford the cost for my tuition fee if it is too late for me to apply the loan now. Just thinking about I may not able to study at uni because of the financial issue, it gives me an invisible pressure and stress.I have no idea of how to calm myself down... because I cannot stop myself from crying. Therefore I would like to ask: 1. When is the deadline for applying the loan?2. Is the procedure difficult?3. What should I do if I already pass the deadline?
