Acoustic Guitar In Dorms?by HassanDI want to start playing the guitar but I am worried about not being able to play it at university because it's too loud and might disturb people (for the first year at least).Now if I go with an electric guitar I can just use headphones and that shouldn't be a problem but if I go with an acoustic guitar, it's just loud... and I am leaning more to it at the moment.Would people mind if I use it at dorms? I will be sensible and not use it after 7pm or 8pm but it could still disturb people if they are studying in the afternoon/early evening?Has anyone took a musical instrument with them to uni and what were your experiences in terms of your flatmates?Also, has anyone had (or has) a flatmate that would play the guitar (acoustic) or any other instrument that you cant use headphones for which ended up annoying you or your flatmates?
