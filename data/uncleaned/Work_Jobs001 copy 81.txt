Re - Probation Worry________________________________________Hi All,Looking for a bit of advice.I am in my current role 5 months, a new manager started 2 months back & took an instant dislike to me, always commenting walking by etc, I asked for a headset 4 weeks back & I was called a 'tart' for wanting one.Back in the middle of December I was given a list of objectives to complete within the department and the manager would test me on it, all went well, he also 'noted' my internet use and asked me to sign the company internet & IT policy which I did, I did not in any way ever abuse the internet , mainly used during breaks.2 weeks ago I was moved into a different role than 1 I was hired for, my position was advertised within the company & filled, I was literally told on the Friday & moved on the Monday.Fast forward to Monday & I was brought into the office with said manager for a meeting with himself and a company rep (happens to be a person who would be very close to my manager, she was just taking notes) I was told my internet usage is still the same and that my manager himself said he 'spied' on me from behind (my desk is onfront of a door, so if ppl are going canteen etc they can see my PC, you can look at my PC via this window) I was sent home & told 'I would be contacted by letter'I was told by 1 of my colleagues yesterday that the said manager sent an email to all staff saying I was no longer with the company ? even before another meeting.I got a letter this morning asking me attend a meeting tomorrow with my manager again and the same company rep.I assume that because I am on probation they will fire me ?
