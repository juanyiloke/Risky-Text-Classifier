Ladycare magnet¥	i went for herceptin today and was given a ladycare magnet to try. I was highly delighted to get the chance to try it out while saving myself £30 not having to buy it.¥	i got home, attached it as per the instructions, then sat back with my laptop for some surfing time.¥	Big mistake! The magnet trashed my hard drive so my freebie is going to cost me far more than £30 to repair my laptop.¥	My husband then came in from work and expressed disbelief that I didn't know 'magnets do that to computers'.¥	just as well for him I was having a good day!!¥	Hoping there's nobody else out there as clueless as me.
