ÊI think I have made a mistake!My old dog had to be put to sleep last monday. She was a collie/lab cross nearly 13 years old.Over the worst of my flashbacks and depressions she has been a great help to me in helping me through the many panic attacks.ÊWhen I was at the vets, they asked me if I wanted to be present when she was sent her to sleep (forever) and I said yes.So I held her head as she died. Unfortunately for me part of my PTSD relates to the death of my boyfriend in front of me 40 years ago.ÊI am now getting depressed by my fucking mind mixing these 2 events up and the flashbacks have returned.ÊTo keep me from killing myself when my boyfriend died, I told myself that by staying alive I could honour and remember him, so I lived on during even the worst of my depressions. Then I found out in 2011 that seeing him die was a false memory which came about as a result of brainwashing in 1972. This took away my reason to live.But luckily I had a dog. When I have been near to despair over the last few years I told myself it would be awful for my pooch if I were to leave her permanently, so I lived on for her.ÊNow I am on my own again ( I am definitely not getting another dog for a while, if ever, again, I can't afford it) I find myself thinking more and more about having nothing to continue to live for.what is the point of continuing?
