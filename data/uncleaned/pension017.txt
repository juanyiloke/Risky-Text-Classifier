Child Poverty is everywhere!This subject has been raised by the Teachers union, almost all of whose members have seen many instances of it! 4 million children - one in three - are currently living in poverty in the UK, one of the highest rates in the industrialised world. A sad inditement of our Government who is happy to send millions on supporting it's international image at the expense of its own people!I had a child, 8, pass out during a visit to us the other week. As a First Aider I treated her and on asking what she had eaten for breakfast was told "a slice of toast" and that was five hours before the visit!
