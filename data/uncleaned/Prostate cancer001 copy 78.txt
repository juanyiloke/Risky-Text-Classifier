BICARBONATE of SODA Thoughts on Bicarb please for reducing acidity levels and increasing PH. John accepts that his acid levels are probably higher than they should be due to his love of acidic things. We did actually try the litmus test this morning and although his wasn't drastic it was less than the neutral level.I was already investigating bicarb for myself when I saw an article on the net this morning referring to it as a cancer treatment and I followed a few links.I'm NOT suggesting Bicarb use instead of conventional medicine. We are already addressing our general diet plus the extras like Turmeric for John and I just wondered whether there were any members who have already tried simple Bicarb as anaccessory to their cancer treatment
