Some do - Some don'tThere was a brief discussion on another thread about who low carbs and who doesn't. I personally have benefited by lowering my carb intake, I'm not perfect and there are some days when . . . . . . . I'll be the first to acknowledge that not everyone does the same thing. In my case I was able to ditch Gliclazide, Januvia and Atorvastatin and lost 4 1/2 stone (work in progress), but I know that's not for everyone.There might be 120,000 members, but I reckon there's maybe only a hundred who post regularly, I have no way of telling. My question is "how many carbs do you eat daily".For me, it's 80gms. How about everyone else?
