You guysI have no idea if this is in the right place,I'm not even sure how to start but I just want to thank everyone on here that's ever taken the time to talk to me, and just let you know that you're all so valuable to me as people, and without you, I think I'd be a mess. This is literally one of these random, mushy outbursts. I've been having a lot of emotional feelings for the people around me lately, it's probably annoying. I want everyone to know that I'm here for them at any time, and that I'm proud of you all
