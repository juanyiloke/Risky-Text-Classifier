Has anyone else experienced this feeling?by Aeli » Mon May 04, 2015 3:51 amI've just been wondering this, so I'm going to ask you guys this. I am fully aware that psychosis is terrifying and is deceptive to the sufferer, but I have a question to those who have a psychotic disorder or have dealt with it.Has anyone who has it ever felt a strange sense of wanting the psychosis to come back? Because I've been feeling a little like this for some reason, which I find strange because most of the delusions and hallucinations I've gotten are very unsettling to me.I'm currently still taking my medication for my psychosis and depression and haven't made any attempts of stopping my doses, as a side note.
