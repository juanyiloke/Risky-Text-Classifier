Struggling today!Finding today tough going food wise, not sure if it's because I didn't eat much yesterday - had a big breakfast out, a spoon of sugar free jelly and total yogurt for lunch as I was still full and then half a cauliflower base pizza for supper. This morning I had a couple of slices of bacon with scrambled eggs, about 12pm, a couple of 'oopsies' with ham, butter and cucumber. Then about 1.30pm, a piece of Brie, a piece of ham and some pepper and cucumber. About 3pm I was starving again so had a couple of oopsies with a spoon of chilli on them, once spread with butter.Had been managing so well, proper no real carbs since Wednesday and only a slice of low carb toast on Monday and Tuesday major carb wise. Thought I had the LCHF thing sussed, but obviously not!!!On the positive side all my glucose readings yesterday and today (before food and 2 hrs after) have been sub 7, much better than the 32 I was hospitalised with two weeks ago!
