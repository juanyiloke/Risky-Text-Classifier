Changing symptomsby cupoftea22 » Fri May 29, 2015 6:35 pmSomething that's been really bothering me lately is my change in symptoms. I started off with the typical symptoms, Identity problems, splitting, pushing people away, intense emotions and relationship problems. The in the last year, Ive been dealing with a lot of anxiety and I noticed the BPD symptoms change, almost as if I wasn't even BPD anymore. (Was diagnosed 4 years ago and literally fitted classic BPD). I started to think I was getting better as no more identity problems, I know longer get obsessed with new people and things, I stopped splitting with my partner, I didn't hate then love him everyday, I stopped being overly upset and instead seemed to just block out all my feelings. I used to feel over the top sadness and worthlessness but now its mainly just anger. Is it possible I could cover all other feelings wth anger as sadness has always been a primary emotion. Ive been through so much this year, and I feel totally confused over the fact I no longer fit the BPD categories so much. My symptoms now are just constant anger/irritation, intense anxiety, and maybe occasionally creating issues in a relationship. I don't feel im 'cured' at all, I'm just wondering if anyone has had symptoms stop for a while or change and why this might be?
