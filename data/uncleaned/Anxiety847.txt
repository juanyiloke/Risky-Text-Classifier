OCD monster is back again.Hi, I'm a newbie and to be honest have never really discussed my biggest fear in 'public'. I have an enormous fear of asbestos, to the point where I am actually in the process of moving home as I have become so scared of the stuff. My friend recently had her kitchen done and discovered the blasted stuff in her tiles, she has since visited my home and I've had to deal with continuous and religious cleaning of my home. To make matters worse I was convinced I had the stuff in my bathroom and called a local surveyor to have a look, it turned out not to be asbestos but my mind is now working overtime as I'm convinced he left asbestos dust from his previous work all over my house. It gets worse, I hoovered as soon as he left and am now convinced that the dust has been blown all over my house, I am in an absolute state and refuse to leave the only room I am sure has not been contaminated.ÊMy OCD is destroying my marriage and my mind is in absolute turmoil. Is there anyone else who has/is going through this hideous obsession?Apologies for my rant.Anxious OCD sufferer.
