A great work environment2013-02-06, 09:57 PMThis is more of an appreciation thread than anything else.ÊIt's been quite a while since I've worked in a great environment. Looking back, it's probably the first time I've experienced it since I graduated college years ago. Sure, there's a lot of work to be done but it certainly lightens the load when my efforts are recognized and appreciated. Tomorrow's my last day (in a way). Long story there. But I just wanted to voice out the relief that comes when one is surrounded by nurturing people. It makes me want to do better and definitely pay it forward.Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it's inspiring.
