Depressed about my partner, being diagnosed with bowel cancer Here is my storyMy partner was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer (not curable) in october 2014, he had an op for remove the primary cancer and now has a stoma. after a few weeks for recovery, he started chemo (8 rounds of chemo). After that he had a break from chemo, as it did what it suppose to do (according to his oncologist).ÊA few weeks after that he was suffering pain near his kidney, so he was admitted to hospital again, had some test and found that the tube that connected the left kidney to the bladder was obstrusted by a swollen lymphnode. so the doctor had to connect a bag that drain the kidney.A few days after the procedure, he was discharged from hospital as he was to restart his chemo this monday. But he is in so much pain so he is now in hospital again.I feel that i cant sleep, not eaten a proper meal for daysi cant concentrate.I cant even watch TV without getting lostI feel like i cant support my partner through thisI feel guilty for my partnerWhen this all happened, i went to see my doctors, but they referred me to Mental Health Services in Leeds, but i never do past the first stages of an initals questions. As it was "too early"Will i be able to bypast seeing my doctor again, and go st8 to ringing the Mental Health services?I think i need help, with coping with this?Thanks for reading this!!KC
