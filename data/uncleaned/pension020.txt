data for saleThe government should come down like a ton of bricks immediately  on the people selling our details, but will it happen,? NO, there will be endless questions in the house, committees set up to find out how it happened, lots of tut tutting and it will drift on and on, NOBODY should be allowed to disclose ANY of our details to anybody other than maybe the police under certain circumstances. but government have stood by and allowed the DVLA and I believe councils to do  this for years.
