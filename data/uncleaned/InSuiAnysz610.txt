New to this..I'm an 18 year old sophomore in college. I've had depression since I was 13. I've never told anyone I have depression. I've always been a shy, soft-spoken easy going introvert. In the past I was always able to cope on my own. However, over the past year or so I seem to have taken a turn for the worst.Êthere isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about killing myself. Every single day for the last 12-18 months I've thought about leaving this world via gunshot wound to the head. I've even contemplated the place and time. I don't really want to die because I'm afraid of the uncertainty that follows death. I also don't want to put my parents in the same agony that I'm in.ÊBut I'm tired of crying when I wake up in the morning and when I go to sleep at night. I'm exhausted, drained, empty, and lonley. I love to help people and see other people happy but I always feel a void inside. I've grown distant from most of my friends and family so I really don't have anyone or any medium to vent to (hence why I'm here). Even though I've never told my family about my depression I know they are aware that something's wrong with me. I don't want to tell them what's going on because I don't want them to think I just want attention. I don't want any pity either because nothing that has transpired in my life is anymore traumatic than what the average person deals with.ÊI feel trapped and cornered. Either I live and suffer until my inevitable death. Or I end it now and run the risk of regretting my decision forever. Either ways it's a lose lose situation.ÊI apologize for writing so much. To be honest I don't care if no one reads this. Like I said before I have nobody to talk to and I just needed a place to vent anonymously
