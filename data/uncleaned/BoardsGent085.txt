Ways to reduce itchiness after shaving pubesI did a stupid thing, got carried away and ended up shaving pubes when I should of just trimmed the. It's 24 hours and the itchiness is already unbearable, can anyone recommend products/methods to reduce itchiness as much as possible, and how long does it commonly last for.. as long as it takes for the hair to grow back? Don't think I could hack even another day without some kind of relief, I shaved it close enough to the stub. Have tried a loofa to exfoliate so far, wearing loose clothing, have used vaseline and moisturerzer (does it matter which one) and hoping these will have some affect. Help
