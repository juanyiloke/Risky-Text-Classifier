The Broke Child's Guide to Affording Universityby shirlz2808Hi Darlings!This is my guide and attempt to save you money. 1) Dedicate a little bit of money every week to buying what you need - So you could use a spare fiver to purchase a utensil set and so on. By September, you should have enough things to go.2) If it hasn't got a brand name, then you may purchase. What is the difference between branded dish washer liquid and non branded? The wonga you'll save.3) Apply for all the university scholarships. They will say something like "Why is this place the sexiest university on earth?" and you will use your academic terminology, gorgeous essay writing skills and BS to get your self some money... Ensure this essay is honest and not plagiarised.4) Embrace every single aspect of minimalism and banish consumerism. This is a good way of life, you will afford better but fewer things.5) Seperate your student finance current account, your bills current account account and your spending current account. So you can set up a direct debit order for bills and your spending accounts. This way you never get yourself into trouble.6) Lidl, Aldi and local markets are very beautiful places. Not just for food.7) If you are an impulsive shopper or walking to the shops are too much work, consider ordering your food online. You can always *roughly* know how much you're spending.
