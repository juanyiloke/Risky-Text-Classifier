A Year On...Completely slipped my mind that October 15 th was my one-year diaversary (Is that the correct terminology)? which I suppose is a good thing as it means diabetes is just a normal part of life for me now. Don't want to go on about how much different I feel now, that's all well-documented here, but for anyone reading these pages who has just been diagnosed, I wanted to say that it might seem all doom and gloom now but armed with the information you need to make the right choices, a diabetes diagnosis can be a chance to get much, much healthier. Think of it as a new start, rather than an end. And you have a new best mate for life to bond with who will never lie to you and always, always tell you what's best for you- your meter. Thanks to everyone here who helped me then and continue to help me now with posts and interesting links. Here's to many, many more diaversaries for all of us xxx
