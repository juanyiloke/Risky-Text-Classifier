What is your view on this?Did anyone see the paramedic programme at lunchtime today?ÊThere was woman driver aged 89!!!!!! in an accident in a KA. She was very fortunate NOT to have been killed but it was her airbag that saved her, although it broke a bone in her chest, which the announcer said inflated at 150 miles an hour.She was only just getting over an operation on her chest but finished up back in the hospital. Personally I would have thought at that age she should NOT have been driving anyway.Ê I am not being vindictive by saying this but as one gets older you cant grip things like you could when younger and reflexes are not so agile.Ê I have NEVER been a driver but all those that have driven a car in the family plus friends and neighbours all seem to give up driving well before they got to 89 because they knew their limitations.Ê
