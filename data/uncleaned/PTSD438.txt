ÊFaking itLately I've been feeling like I'm faking life.ÊGet up and do things, smile when you should, make small talk when you should, laugh when you know you should. When people ask how you are you smile say good - coz they don't want/need your answer of 'I don't know/hopeless'.ÊFeel none of it.I don't think this is something new, pretty sure it's been this way a lot of my life. Maybe the difficulty now is that I know it's happening, and that is worse. You know you should be feeling the feelings of happiness, laughter, sadness but there is nothing - and that is frightening/frustrating.ÊWhy does progression feel like regression? What a sh*tty place to be.
