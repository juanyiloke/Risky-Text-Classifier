Prayer - even if you're not religiousIt feels pretty strange to be posting this since I'm just this side of being atheist, but one of the most helpful resources I've found over the past few years is a prayer line operated by the Unity Church, a non-denominational (and not even necessarily Christian) church.You can call any time, 24/7, and speak with a live 'prayer associate' who will listen to you and then pray with you on the phone...and it's just as much encouragement and positive affirmations as it is 'prayer'. And despite the fact that I'm very far from being a Christian or even believing in god, I've found them more helpful than I can say.Anyways, the number (in the US) is 1-800-669-7729 or 1-800-NOW-PRAY. Give them a shout next time you feel overwhelmed, lonely, or sad. They also have a website and a free smartphone app - just search for SILENT UNITY.
