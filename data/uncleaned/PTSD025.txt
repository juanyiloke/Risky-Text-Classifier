Feeling SafeWe had some severe thunderstorms roll through yesterday afternoon and evening. My 3 year old was scared of the thunder and didn't want to go to sleep at bedtime. I sat with him for a little bit and tried to explain that thunder is just a loud noise and won't hurt him. I talked him into trying to sleep and he said he wanted to "snuggle my hand" (basically hugging my arm like one would do with a teddy bear). Once he did that he fell right asleep.It took something so little and effortless to make him feel safe. I tried to think back to find any memories of me feeling safe like that. I realized that I haven't ever really felt totally safe. Even now the only place I feel safe is in my house (and sometimes it can feel unsafe too when the intrusive thoughts are bad). Even with people, there are a very few people who I feel safe around. My T says I am needy for safety.So...Do you feel safe? In what way? If not, do you know what it would take to make you feel safe?I know it is kind of a broad topic. I am really interested in how others feel safe or get safe and what/how/why. Maybe something will work like that for me.
