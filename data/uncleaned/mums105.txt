My kids really upset me today and i ended up having a few tears ..... this got me thinking...what do other people cry about?I don't mean life shattering terribleness things that of course make you cry but you know - the more 'trivial' everydayish things?Mine are when my hubby doesn't pull his weight and makes me feel undervalued and unappreciated and bloody pissed off and when my kids know how to press every single one of my buttons on days that i just need it to be a little easier...
