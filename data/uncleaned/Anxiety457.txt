constant analysis of thoughts with GADBeing that I have been trying to figure out and overcome my anxiety for 3 years now without meds I have developed this constant analysis of how I think about things and I beleive it's because I am trying so hard to get back to "normal" that I am constantly analyzing my thoughts to see if they are normal or not and if I should be thinking them or not. I know this Is wrong and making it worse but it's automatic at this point I feel so aware of all my thoughts it's driving me nuts. I assume this is common with GAD, it's my name issue, the constant introspection of my thoughts and I tend to get that lost in your thoughts feeling which sucks .... any advice?
