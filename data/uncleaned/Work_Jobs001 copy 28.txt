What would it take to make you move?________________________________________Hi, something has been stressing me a great deal the past few days. How much of an increase in pay would it take to make you move roles?Allow me to expand on that. I think Im going to be offered a job early next week. I had originally interviewed for a role that would have been a promotion in terms of progression from my present role. However, I was not selected for that role, but was invited to go forward for a role they thought I would be suitable for. Effectively, its the same role as the role Im in now, so a lateral move. Although initially I didnt want to go forward for it, after some persuasion from the recruiters, I did. The only attraction I had to the role is that in this company I may have a better chance of progression in future, as in my present company theres little opportunity.The cons as I see it for moving are¥	I really like the place Im in now and enjoy going to work¥	I can see the positive impacts Ive had¥	My manager is fantastic, completely trust he has my best interests at heart¥	My co-workers are excellent and Im well respected¥	Theres a great work-life balance ethos in itWhat my concern is the ability to progress; due to the structure its very hard to see how I could move up in the business. By going to a new business I obviously risk losing all of the above. Im in a new company, have to forge new relationships, start from scratch again, may not be as great a place to work, etc. But it likely means Ive a better chance of career progression. Ive weighed up all of those reasons. The difference in salary (as this would be a lateral move into a similar role) would likely be between 3-10%. Based on the above, would you leave a job where you were quite happy for the higher possibility of career progression and a 3-10% increase in pay? The reason Im asking is because my personal feeling has swung quite strongly behind it not being worth leaving somewhere to make a lateral move, but worried Im thinking short term...
