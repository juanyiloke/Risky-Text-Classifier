DD is 15 weeks and currently sleeps in the carrycot/bassinet part of her pram on the living room floor during the day and a bed nest in our bedroom upstairs at night. However she is fast outgrowing the bassinet, (we have an Uppababy Vista - I'm watching the other thread with interest!) so we need to find something to replace it with. We thought a travel cot might be an option but I am a little worried that they are designed for occasional use rather than daily? Any advice would be very gratefully received! If a travel cot is the best option, any particular brands and models? I realise we will need to replace the bed nest with a proper cot in the next couple of months too!
