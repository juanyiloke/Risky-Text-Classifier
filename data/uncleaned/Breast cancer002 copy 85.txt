Joint pain!!!¥	Hi Ladies!¥	(Me again)¥	Mum has been having  extreme bad joint pain as some of you already know in her knees and ankles. We called GP and they said the codiene (I can't spell it) and cream will be ready tomorrow. My mum is tough on pain but she's struggling a lot. So we called 111 they sorted us an appointment I finally picked up the codein and cream. She took it an hour ago but so far no change and cream either. Shes a bit worried that too many pain killers can be dodgy to her liver. Any other advice you can give? I have been gently massaging her legs and what not but so far it's still bad. Mum would like to know usually how long does this last for ( she knows it varies on ppl) she had her first T chemo on Wednesday just gone.
