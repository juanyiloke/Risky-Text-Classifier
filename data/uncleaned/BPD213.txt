ÊAm I WrongWhen I was young I used to be close to my nan but for the last 5 years or so I've only seen her once a month at most. She's 84 and for the last 3 weeks she been in her hospital really ill we have a pretty big family and everyone been visiting her all the time I live with my mum, dad and brother. My mum and dad been there everyday for visiting hours and my brother has when he's had the chance, but I've felt no need to go, I knew it is her time but I just don't feel any sadness, everyone has been asking me to go see her and I think they think bad stuff about me for not going but I just don't feel anything about her passing away.But I see death has a good thing, it finally sets us free from this hell we call life. Maybe this is why I'm not upset like the other, don't get me wrong I feel sad for my dad because its his mum he is losing.Anyway today everyone had a phone call off the doctor saying she is in critical state and it only a matter off time because she not responding to anything so all the family need to go. So my family been there all day they all know it going to happen at any point so they are all very upset a lot off crying, tonight my dad asked me if I wanted go say bye.I said no I'm okay but I felt like I'm in the wrong for saying this, like all my family just think bad of me for this. I wouldn't of minded going and saying bye but her room is full of family and I know how awkward it would be for me to be around them while they are like this I know they need it but it would bother me so much that I wouldn't be like them so they would just think I'm some freak.ÊI'm just really worried now for when she does die and my mum, brother and specially my dad are going to be very upset and mourning while I'm in the house like nothing has happened how awkward is that going to feel?Êcan't stop thinking about the awkwardness I'm not good with this crap.Am I a bad person or a freak?
