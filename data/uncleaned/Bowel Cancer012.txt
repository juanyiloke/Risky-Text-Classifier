dare i say...Dear friends, just to let you know my scan showed 'no evidence of disease recurrence ,and, no progression of the lung nodules seen before chemo'. We are all on a wing and a prayer, but it will settle my anxiety for a few weeks. They want to put me on 6 monthly Cts too. I'm unsure how I feel about that! I hope you don't mind me sharing my news with you all. There's a lot of people struggling at the moment, but a few have you have said yes, you must post good news!Love to all as always. Angie
