Hey Everyone! I hope everyone is having a good weekend! I'm doing good but my cough that has been here on and off for 3-4 months is back yet again. This time, it is coming with extreme fatigue. I go to bed at around 830pm (except for today) and am soo tired in the morning. I had strep on and off for a month and a half and they just sent in another test (I have to wait until Monday). I'm so nervous that I will have strep again. My asthma is so bad and I use my rescue inhaler daily! Should I take antibiotics AGAIN if it is positive? If it's not strep? What could it be? Why am I still sick? Anyone else had this happen??
