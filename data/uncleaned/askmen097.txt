spinoff: Calling back after f*ucking up a phone interview2012-10-06, 01:06 AMAbout a week ago, I got a call from a guy about a position with a remodeling contractor/handyman company.ÊBasically the job would be fielding calls from customers and potential customers, doing cost estimates, and scheduling the guys out in the field.I kind of got caught off guard. The guy talking to me was walking out to his truck, and I was walking through the quad at UW. The position is a little bit beyond what I could just jump into, and the guy sensed that. Yada yada yada, conversation over.ÊIn hindsight, I wish I'd asked to come and shadow him for a couple days without pay to see if it would be a good fit (I'm more than capable of learning the job). Can I call the guy back?
