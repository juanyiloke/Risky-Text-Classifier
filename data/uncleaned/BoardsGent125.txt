Is it seen as acceptable for women to hit men?I've been following a thread elsewhere on the site about groping and some of the women who have been victims of this were saying they would hit the guy that did it.ÊNow over here looking at it from a male point of view I have been groped in a nightclub but I have to say that there is no way would I hit the woman that did it, and if I did I would be up on assault charges.I just get the feeling that it is not taken as seriously when a woman slaps a man in public compared to vice versa.
