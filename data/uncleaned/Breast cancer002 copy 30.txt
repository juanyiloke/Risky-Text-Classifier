Tight chest while on chemo¥	Hi all, can anyone tell me if they have experienced issues with a tight chest while on FEC-T?¥	I am due my 3rd cycle shortly, but with both the first 2, I started having an uncomfortable feeling of tightness in my upper chest around 3-4 days after my cycle and it lasted for a few days.  With my first cycle, i thought it just might anxiety, as I didn't know what to expect with my first dose, but it repeated again on my next dose.¥	I spoke to my Onc and he said it's not a normal side effect, as this would usually happen when chemo is administered or directly after, not days later.  He has reduced the drug that can cause heart palpatations for my next cycle, but really didn't have any idea what was causing the discomfort.  It is not painful and I don't any sharp pains, palpations, or shortness of breath. It just feels like something is sitting on my upper chest and won't move.
