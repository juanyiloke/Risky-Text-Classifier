Optimum sugar levelI was diagnosed a type 2 diabetic 5 months ago and prescribed metformin 500mg twice daily. I altered my diet and exercise every day and very quickly lost 3 stones and have a "normal" bmi reading. Blood sugars are consistantly 4.5-4.9 (I test once a week before breakfast) and yet my GP has told me I am at risk of a hypo and my sugar level should be 7.0. I understood the optimum reading was 4.0-7.0 and anywhere in this band would be desirable. Can anyone shed light on my GP's comment as he was just insistant he was correct without an understandable explination?
