OAP libidoHi, I'm putting together a piece for a national newspaper on above topic and urgently looking to interview a lady aged 65-70 who has had sex in the last year. We’d pay a £200 fee and she’d just explain how as you get older you don’t have to lose your sex drive etc! Please get back to me asap if you can help! Thanks, Matt, (Contributing Editor)[/font][/size]
