whole departments put on pips________________________________________i have normally see this happen to indiviual people. But i am right in thinking that it is strange for nearly all permenent employees in a business to be told that they are all going to be put on pips when you have reached a years service? Bear in mind its happening to people that are there 1 year or more and nearly all employees are going to be put on pips ???The job role has also sort of been changed to what is was to start off with and each person seems to have different sort of targets set for them.thats what going down at my workplace and I think its strange. It is sort of new company so i dont think it is happening because there are going to close down and to avoid paying redundancy or whatever.
