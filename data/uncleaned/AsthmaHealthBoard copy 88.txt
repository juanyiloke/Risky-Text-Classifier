  Bricanyl versus Ventolin________________________________________I've recently went through a bad time with Asthma triggered by allergies to shopping mall toilet cleaning fluids etc. Last week I had to call a doctor for a home visit while being on Prednisone, other max asthma meds and the rest......and almost ending up in hospital. Home visit Dr suggested I try Ventolin instead of Bricanyl, since I've been taking that along with Symbicort 400/12 for a long time now. So I've been trying the Ventolin for the last few days and find that I've needed to take as much of this initially as I did of the Bricanyl - and then more during the night as the effects of this med didn't last as long as the Bricanyl puffer. Today I've had the extreme shakes and felt really weird because of the side effects of the Ventolin. This is the 2nd time I've tried Ventolin after Drs recommending that I use it and I'm quite disgusted with the after effects of this med. I will not use it again and will go back to using Bricanyl. It may take longer to work, but it's affects last longer, so that I don't have to wake through the night twice (like I did last night)and take more of it. Tonight I've been online researching the differences between Bricanyl and Ventolin and am amazed and somewhat concerned at how misinformed people are about the medications and even more concerned that some would be advising others irresponsibly with this misinformation. Thanks for your attention here.....and stay well!
