ÊDownhillHi everyoneHope you are well.I was just wondering if you could help and possibly over some advice.I don't have an ED but over the past months I have noticed my eating habits have gone down hill....it's like I can recognise the bad thoughts but I can't stop them. I do have BPD and OCD which probably makes it worse.I'm getting married in August. I am 2 stone overweight and I am terrified of not losing weight. I'm so scared of being overweight and not fitting into my dress. I eat healthy, but have started to restrict my calories and if I eat more I get so guilty and terrified and ashamed.Before that (and still) I take [moderated] every couple of days. I know people say you can't lose weight from them but I still can't stop myself.I've told my CPN about them and went through a chain of events. I text her about the restriction of calories as my Husband said it would be a good idea. I guess in a moment of clarity I see how bad I am getting but with the BPD I am very impulsive. It seems if I am not self harming I am doing something else.I just feel a bit lost. I desperately want to lose weight, I think about it all the time. I was made to book an appointment with my GP. I just don't know what to say. All I do is think about weightloss....I just feel like I am going so downhill and spiraling out of control. I'm terrified of eating food today.ÊI just feel like no one understands
