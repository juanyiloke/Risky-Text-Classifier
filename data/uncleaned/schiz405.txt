ÊDisorganised thoughtsI've become to come to terms with the insight of schizoaffective disorder, i realise my thoughts aren't like other peoples i'm not experiencing any type of psychosis at the minute but i've had three bouts of it and i think the medication has brought this on, i'm not a believer in medication yet i know somethings wrong with me. I do take the medication, currently lorazepam twice a day because i want to stay compliant due to my son being relocated to live with his dad which has devastated me.ÊMy thoughts are sometimes unordinary and i think why did i think that which comes into affect whilst i'm anxious or it uncomfortable situations. The thoughts don't affect me because i know they're just thoughts due to my illness, but they don't seem to be in accordance with what's happening, my facial expressions have become quite narrow and my once friends thought i was unhappy or miserable all the time.Where's the best place to make friends with people with mental illness i have a suspicion we're all struggling with one thing or another.Also wondering if any other medication would help my disoriented thoughts, a miracle cure to bring me back to being the me i was a few years back, i was on fluoxetine which i can only blame for my current inbalance, which i again had to take not only to comply with a order but to stay medically compliant for the courts. It'[s really messed me up.I've heard about d-serine and d-aspartic acid which is suppose to not deal with the side affects but completely eradicate the illness altogether, has anyone else heard of his, i was medical research due on mice, unfortunately...
