Clearing up spots "down there"...Howdee all, a bit of an embarrassing or annoying one.I have two spots that keep reappearing in the same place "down there".They'll clear up, then will come back in the same place.ÊIt's definitely not an STD! I haven't been with a lady in a long time.To me, it just looks like, because there are so many hair follicles there, it's hard for them to clear up fully.There is also a vein under the skin, so blood constantly flowing could keep these active under the skin?I sometimes have to pop the hair follicle. It has the potential to look embarrassing the next time I am with a fair lady.As I mentioned, it's in the exact same place, two spots that come and go, come and go.Apart from sever elbow grease, is there anything over the counter or in a supermarket that would help to cleanse this area.....Ê
