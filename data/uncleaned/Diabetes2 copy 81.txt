wrong vaccination   When starting primary school i was given my Diptheria, Tetanus and polio vaccination. Weeks later my mother was asked if she wanted me to have my measles injection and she said yes, I received the vaccination and came out sucking a sugar lump, my mother thought that I had been good and never thought anything about it. Soon after that she was asked if I wanted the measles vaccination, she said that I had already had it and was told I was given the wrong injection. A couple of months later I was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes. Could this have been brought on by this mistake?
