ÊIs it possible to have PTSD from something that I didn't experience personally?This may sound kind of weird. Of course, I am not asking you to diagnose me, it's just something I've been thinking about and I was hoping someone with a little more experience could offer a bit of insight.ÊAnyway, here is my story. Basically, I have a very serious fear of driving. I put off getting my license until I was 18, and even now it's extremely hard for me to learn and practice because I panic when I'm on the road and sometimes have anxiety attacks. Naturally, I avoid it at all costs except for when I'm forced. It makes me feel so useless because I always have to rely on other people to take me places, and I guess it's embarrassing being my age and not knowing how to drive. Anyway, that's besides the point...In an attempt to overcome this fear, I've been thinking about what could have caused such a phobia. Then something occurred to me. See, my brother got in a serous car accident when I was 15. He came out all right in the end, but I guess I've always been spooked because my brother was such a good driver, always very careful. Driving came naturally to him. I can't stop thinking that if it happened to him, why couldn't it happen to me, someone who isn't naturally good at driving?ÊIs it possible that PTSD might be causing my fear of driving, even though it wasn't me personally who got in the accident? Or is it more likely just an expression of my GAD?ÊI hope those of you who actually have been diagnosed with PTSD don't find this disrespectful. I am only trying to size up my fear so that I can learn to deal with it.Thank you for reading.
