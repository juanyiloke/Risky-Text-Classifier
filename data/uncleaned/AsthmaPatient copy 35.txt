Low and Erratic Blood Oxygen Levels  7  (This seems like the most likely forum to be relevant) My wife has been asthmatic all her life but it has always been well managed by Ventolin etc. Last year she had pneumonia (twice) and so we started keeping a regular log of various readings and her general state of being. One thing is we have a couple of little fingertip heart rate and SpO2 monitors - now the very odd and frustrating thing is that when I use it it comes up immediately with sensible and normal readings eg 99 sp02 and 68 hr. When my wife uses it it consistently starts out very bad on spo2 eg low 90s, even 80s, it then tends, within say 30s (even doing nothing), to go up to generally normal levels in the mid-90s but it can alsso waver after that. She doesn't wear nail varnish or anything. We have also had times in hospital where a nurse will try to get her spo2 reading and give up saying the devce is broken! Can anyone suggest why she might be seeing this and if the readings should be disregarded or not - clearly they are well below normal but it nearly always stabilises for no apparent reason???TIA,M
