'Newcastle diet' adviceHi I recently started on my version of the Newcastle diet. I say my version as I swapped Optifast meals for Exante as Optifast were not easily available.1 week in and mixed experiencesBS down from 10.4 to 7.8 but in the week all over the place, some higher then I had for some time, up to 11+. And lots of the symptoms from original diagnosis, 'cold eyes' blurry vision, crinkly tingly fingers and frequent urination?Weight down by 8lb to 14st 13lb, lowest since diagnosis.BP down 145/90 to 119/88So far so good. Not hungry at all, fancied some meat or a beer from time to time but easy to resist. Mind set ok.Any tips or advice welcomeregardsKim
