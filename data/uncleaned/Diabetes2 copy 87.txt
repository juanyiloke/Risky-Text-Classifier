Impaired Glucose Tolerance   I have just been diagnosed with IGT and am so confused. I feel like i am under water and feeling faint quite a lot of the time. I now know this is low sugar. I am a woman of 47 years old was feeling quite unwell for about 6months and didnt know why. I went to the doctors and told him my symptoms and he said i had vertigo. I was at work and felt like the room was swimming in front of me and felt like passing out. I went back to the doctors and he ordered blood tests. My blood wasnt good so he sent me for a glucose test which came back 9.8. Thats when he said i had IGT. Still trying to sort out the sugar levels with diet and exercise and hope it sorts out soon. Its hard work and hard to explain to people who dont know the symptons you feel like your going mad.
