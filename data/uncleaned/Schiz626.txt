ÊAftermath of a psychotic break? Personality changes?There is a lot of information out there about the prodromal phase of a psychotic illness, the psychological and physical changes an individual goes through before becoming fully psychotic. I'm having a hard time finding information about what happens afterward.I still haven't recovered from the initial psychotic break I had when I was 12. This was 11 years ago. I've only had one other severe psychotic episode since, though I've had chronic mild symptoms continuously.That first episode changed my personality. I'm more withdrawn, introverted. I am also more self-focused and concerned with how people perceive me. I am acutely aware of who I am, and that others may judge me for it. And I really do not want to be judged.ÊI had a lot more energy before my first break. That could have been because I was a kid, but I feel like I should have had a lot of energy a few years ago as a college student, and I didn't. When my mood gets elevated, I am more energetic, but not at my baseline.I feel immobilized and trapped in my own head.ÊThis all started in the spring of 2004 or shortly after. I attributed it to depression. However, I didn't get severely depressed until I was in late high school/early college.ÊHave any of you experienced this? Can a psychotic break traumatize someone in a way that makes them withdrawn, self-conscious, low in self-esteem, and lacking in energy? Basically to give them a chronic low-grade depression that becomes characteristic for them, even if they do not identify with it?Thanks
