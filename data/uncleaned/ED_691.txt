How to get the thoughts to stopSo, I feel my eating may be getting a tiny bit better compared to what it was for awhile, but I am still struggling with restricting quite a bit. I've been exercising a lot more, which has made me feel better overall, both mentally and physically. I like how it makes me feel and the "me" time I get. My problem is that ever since I started trying to make an effort to eat more the exercising increased a ton and the negative thoughts about my body have drastically increased. Even though I can look in the mirror and see definition, which I should feel good (in a healthy/strong way) about, all I can focus on is areas I see as imperfect. I can't walk past a mirror without lifting up my shirt to look at my waist/stomach or arms. I feel extremely mad/upset when I do allow myself an actual meal, rather than a few bites of something here or there like normal. I've purged a few times after eating minimal amounts of food, which I haven't done in years. Is it normal to have this sudden increase of negative thoughts/actions when making an initial attempt to increase eating? The thoughts about food and my body are constantly running through my head. Any suggestions on how to decrease them?
