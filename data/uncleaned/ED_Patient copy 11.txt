Hit a brick wall in anorexia recoveryHey everyone! I'm new here, and I've been suffering from anorexia for a few years now and have been in recovery since the beginning of March.I've gained to a bmi of 15.6, but now I feel like there's nothing wrong with that and I no longer need to be in treatment.Though I feel really awful all of the time with I'm sick of and want it to change, and I know I need to gain weight for that to happen.I decided before that If I was To decide I couldn't deal with recovery that I wouldn't let myself go back down the spiral I'd just end my life, as I cannot live like that anymore, and right now I just feel like I'm not sick ebough and anorexia is how my life must be, and if that's the case then I don't want it.But commiting suicide is not what I want to do as it would destroy my friends and family.I'm imagining pretty much everyone hits this place during recovery, how do you carry on? Please tell me it gets easier...?
