Ideal womanProbably been done 100 times but sure there's nothing like a fresh perspective. What do the lads of boards consider an ideal woman? I'll start off. * Similar sense of humour. I curse a lot and make stupid jokes, so it would be great to have someone similar. I'm also fairly sarcastic, sarcasm is fecking hilarious to me.* Not into the usual cliches such as Marylin monroe quotes, disney expectations of what a relationship should be or having a list and comparing you to it. ( I actually went on a date with a girl who told me she had a list and was making mental notes of the right boxes I am ticking ). A "keeping up appearances" type is a definite no-no.* Easy going, happy with staying in with a movie as with doing a bit of travelling.I really find it hard to describe these things as I think any girl has a certain quality that I find attractive. As long as the above is down, I think looks are secondary to having a great woman in your life. I suppose I should mention I wouldn't be fond of going out with someone that had a kid/kids as I've been there and done that. I have been out with some absolute psychos too who I have given the benefit of the doubt to despite having been cheated on, even physically assaulted. So somebody a bit more grounded and down to earth would be good.
