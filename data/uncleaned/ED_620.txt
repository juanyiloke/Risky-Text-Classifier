Communication and anorexiaI've just had therapy and we talked about how I use my body as a means of communication. Very underweight = I'm not okay... Healthy weight = people think I'm fine.ÊI've recently gained a lot of weight and I'm now in the 'healthy' category (this scares me beyond words for many reasons). This bothers me immensely, not just because I want to be thin, but because I'm scared people will look at me and think, 'oh she's better now' when in reality I have a lot of scary things going on.ÊHow do I lean to communicate with words rather than losing weight/cutting/burning? I'm really stuck and all I want to do right now is lose the weight I've gained. I need to learn to communicate in different ways but I don't know how.
