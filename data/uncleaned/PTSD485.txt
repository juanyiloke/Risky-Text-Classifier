ÊHappy BoxSo I've been in the crisis center for a total of 20 days over a period of a month and a half. Flashback was and is one of my biggest problems at the moment, to the point my therapist has recommended exposure therapy.One of the intervention workers recommended I start a Happy Box, it's exactly what it sounds like, A real box, mine is wooden with a see through plastic top. inside I've put pictures of people i care about, places i love, quotes, certain objects like a dried rose my bf gave me for valentines day....basically anything that reminds you of happy moments or memories!So far I'm enjoying adding things to my box, and because it's made out of wood i get to draw on it, and design the outside as well.Ê
