GYPSY's (Generation Y Yuppies)2013-09-12, 12:27 PMA friend shared this article on Gypsies this morning. To be honest, I only skimmed it, but I think there's a lot of truth in it.The comments following the article got in to a debate about expectations vs. "structural problems" with the economy. Though I see some truth with the economic problems, I mostly fall into the camp that peoples expectations are too high.I'm not sure about the article's definition of Generation Y. I was born in the late 70s and always considered myself part of Gen X, but I could be wrong.Thoughts on the article?~ The End.
