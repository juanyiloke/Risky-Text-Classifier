I need helpHello. I'm Sky, and I could really use some help. Voices in my head are telling me that I'm good enough. I'm really stressed and alone right now and I don't know what to do. I just want to end it but I know it's not the right thing to do. I need help. I want to be a better person. I don't want to leave the few friends I have. I know suicide isn't okay. I know it isn't the right answer but It's all I have now. I'm really scared I'm going to give up. I don't want to give up. I want to be strong. Please, somebody help me.
