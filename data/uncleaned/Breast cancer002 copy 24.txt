heart scan and oncologist appointment tomorrow¥	Afternoon ladies and gentlemen, hope you are all as well and has happy as you can be. As all you herceptin positive ladies will know, we are sent for ultrasounds on our hearts every three months, my first, since starting herceptin, is tomorrow. Last week, when I went for my herceptin the nurse took my blood for the results to be back for my oncologists meeting which is tomorrow about 1 hour after my heart ultrasound. I'm going to both appointments alone and I'm apprehensive about hearing something bad, can anyone tell me what they are looking for in the blood? X
