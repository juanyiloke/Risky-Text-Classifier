Time off Work / Return to WorkHelloI was diagnosed with T3 bowel cancel in June 2012 and selected to take part in the "Foxtrot Trial" which meant three courses of chemotherapy (Oxy and 5fu) before surgery, followed by a further nine adjuvant chemotherapy sessionsI was able to continue working through most of my treatment (except five or six weeks off for recovery from the surgery in August 2012) until the Christmas holidays when the side effects of the chemotherapy accumulated to such an extent that I was signed off from work, a situation which has continued to date (currently I have been off ten weeks)My final chemo session was on March 1st and last week I was extremely fatigued and without appetite which is slowly improving this week. although I am still very tired and suffering the usual side effectsMy question is, I expect to be able to return to work next week and intend to visit my GP this week to discuss my return to work schedule (I am currently signed off until approximately 21st March)I would welcome feedback from other patients as to their time off work and return to work experiences and suggestionsI know that chemo affects everyone differently and there is no right or wrongs as such, but I do feel guilty having been off work for such a length of time and although I would be doing no one any favours by returning to work when I am not 100% my boss is quite demanding and I wonder if he fully understands what I am going through!Will my doctor recommend a phased return to work or full time immediately or is this something I should suggest? I have no experience of such matters and welcome any suggestionsOn another note, are most employers understanding of such matters? Whilst mine kept me on full pay last year, they immediately put me on SSP when I was signed off in January! Surviving on SSP has only made me more stressed and feeling worthless (this after over five years of service!)Thanks in advance for your feedbackPeter
