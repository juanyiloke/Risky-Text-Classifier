My four year old child has a few problems:- still barely using sentences- nothing complex, just words- doesn't usually say when hungry, needs toilet, cold, hurt, etc.- screams and cries like a baby BUT:- she interacts and plays little games (interactive facial games, even simple verbal ones, like pretending to be daddy's age)- she does get dizzy when she spins around and is afraid of heights- a few other classic indicators for autism are missingI have autism on my side of the family so am possibly hypervigilant.The problem is compounded by the fact that the local children speak a different language, which is confusing for her, no doubt.We are visiting England next week (near St Albans) and will be staying for a month.Obvs NHS is out (we aren't covered, non-resident) but who can I take her to see urgently in order to get a possible diagnosis / help / advice from?Time goes on and the hoped-for advance in development just hasn't come.
