Doing GCSE's at uni?by jamespelibyFirst of all I'd like to apologise for posting this in what I believe to be the wrong forum topic - I wasn't able to post a question via the 'Post' feature on the green header bar at the very top of this page, under the 'Uni courses' tick-box, as the pathetic feature enforces a selection of a course, and I don't want to post my question in a completely irrelevant course's forum-topic.Anyway, I was wondering - are you able to do extra GCSE's (that you didn't do at high school or college) in university?I've been self-studying Spanish for a while now but I want evidence to show future employers that I can speak another language - I'd rather not just sayI'm able to speak it but actually prove that I can speak it by being tested on it.Thanks in advance for any answers!
