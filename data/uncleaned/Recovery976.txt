Thank youI came here back in April, just looking for hope but never posted.Well, the feelings have returned this past week and I've been edging the lines of suicidal thoughts, swaying back and forth across the border. About 45 mins ago I received an e-mail for my birthday and I cannot fully express the appreciation I felt. It was the flicker of a flame at the end of a very dark tunnel, but has rekindled a small spark of hope somewhere deep down inside of me. Thank you, with all of my heart.I needed it, so badly
