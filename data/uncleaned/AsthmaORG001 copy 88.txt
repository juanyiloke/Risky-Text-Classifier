Unsure of how long to increase inhalers for Hi all,About a fortnight ago I had a cold which cause me to have an annoying productive cough. About 10days ago I increased my inhaler, which helped and the cough is finally on it's way out now. I don't have an action plan and last time I saw the nurse she told me to increase it as I needed to. I doubled the amount of puffs as this is what I've always been told to do in the past, but I don't know when I should drop back down to normal. I'm still struggling a bit with exercise, but only intense exercise, other than that I'm fine. I tried dropping it this morning and have been fine all day. Should I be ok to keep it at normal levels now? I'd rather not go and see the nurse, she'll just tell me I'm fine and moan at me for increasing it (I seriously can't win!).
