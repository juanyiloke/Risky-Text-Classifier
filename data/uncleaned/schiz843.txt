Hi I'm 29 years old and a mother of a 5 month old son. His daddy suffers from schizophrenia and manic depression. He was doing really good when I was pregnant and when I turned 6 months pregnant he started going down hill. He lives in Florida and I'm living in Tennessee for the time being. He called a couple days ago and he sounded really good. He was staying at a halfway house and taking his meds, but he messed up and got kicked out on Sun. He called me today and he was talking about how the Marines want him to fight the Taliban and the UFC wants him to do underground fighting. I suffer from chronic depression. I don't know what to do. I want to help him but I don't know how. The hospital said if he goes back there they are gonna put him in a State Hospital. What should I do? Should I give up or should I stick it out and pray that he gets better. I want him better for his sake and our sons. When he's regulated on his meds he's such a good person. I have a hard time keeping up with him. We been together for almost 2 years and I never knew anyone with his condition. So I'm new to this.
