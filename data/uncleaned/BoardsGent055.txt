How much did you spend on "The Ring"?I've reached the point where I want to go ring shopping, - again ;-) and am wondering what a suitable amount to spend is these days. I was married previously almost ten years ago, and at the time herself of the time indicated that nothing less than 5k would be acceptable,(I should have ran at that point) so that's what I spent.Now in drastically reduced financial circumstances, but still working - just, I want to start again with the woman of my dreams, whom I thought for many years didn't even exist. We are totally on the same page, and happier than either of us ever has been.ÊI have noted which styles she likes, and today saw a ring for 2k which I think I can pay for by the end of this year.ÊSo my question is, - is this enough? What did you guys spend?ÊMy after tax is about 30k, but I have a big mortgage and some debt.ÊShe earns 33 gross, and most of her friends would be in the same bracket.ÊShe does however know a little about diamonds, so she'll be able to roughly guess the value of any ring I produce.
