Êlost and alone when in the best of companyI can't talk to my bf, I don't know how to deal with it.ÊMindless chit chat, debates about the world and all that I can do, but me talking about me, how I feel, what I want and being asked questions is almost impossible, it's like the words all just jumble up or fall out of my head. Its so frustrating because he then thinks I'm purposely hiding things from him. Then he gets stroppy even tho he says he's not, I can feel it which in turn makes me not want to talk.ÊI don't know what to do. I started therapy but only had 3 sessions as I've moved house and no longer under the mental health team from that area and no referral has come through yet, I've self referred via doctors website but nothing yet.ÊAnyone else struggle to talk?
