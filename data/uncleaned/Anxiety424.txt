Feels like my body is giving upI posted something close to this on the medicine board, but wanted to find out other opinions from just a symptom perspective.I am having bad episodes of panic and physically feel like absolute hell currently. There is so much pressure in my head/eyes, horrible neck pain, my vision is out of whack, an I wake up with incredibly obsessive thoughts and depression until I force myself to get up.ÊOne thing I noticed is that I cannot stare at anything. Everything continuously moves around as if my eyes were shaking and adjusting. I had my girlfriend look at my eyes when I stared and she got weirded out because my pupils keep going from completely dilated to constricted rapidly. I learned that my eyes have been doing this all day, leaving my eyes feeling "exhausted" and me being unable to focus. Driving is over-stimulating because there is too much coming at me at a quick pace, so my girlfriend has been a big help.I really need some advice on what to do. I've got to get better. This is miserable. I feel like my body is deteriorating, as is my mind. I am afraid to go anywhere but work and home because of fear of random panic attacks and just miserable levels of exhaustion and head/eye/neck pressure. I feel so ill all the time that I am not doing any of the things I used to that made me feel great. The only thing that has helped in the past was medicine, but currently it is not working at all. These symptoms are 24/7, not just episodic. I feel like nothing will get any better. What do I do?
