Starting treatment on 26th Due to start my radiotherapy  end of this month....Low residue diet starts the week before and  last time I found the laxative I had to take at night was too much as it really made me go if you know what I mean....anyhow they told me to decrease from 45ml at night to 35ml and it did help....However talking to others that have had the radiotherapy they say you get similar needs to use the toilet at any time during the day.....my appointments will be between 11am and 12am and I have a ambulance car to take me to hospital and bring me back every day....I think I'll be ok going as I'm up early and will have had a chance to use the loo before I get picked up at 8am but I'm really worried about the return journey.....it's between 40 and 50 mins drive back and I'm worried about getting caught short.....it's not my car and I'd hate to have an accident and there are no public toilets en route.....Could anyone shed a light on this....what do you  do if you need to go urgently......I'm panicking now
