Backpack for the officeHi, I currently use a messenger bag for the office. It's getting a bit shabby and worn...it's OK for carrying files, tablet, paper etc....but if I throw in a bunch x or anything bulky...it doesn't work.So I wanted to get a backpack but one that looks good for the office or a bigger style messenger bag.Not sure if this is the right forum...if not Mods feel free to move it.Any advice or recommendations?
