Why do people get embarassed about public breastfeeding?I have no children yet but I am totally ok with public breastfeeding. Many of my friends / family do it. However, they all were subjected at one point or another to comments such as “no one wants to see your tits”, “yes it’s natural but so is peeing, you don’t see me doing it publicly” and my personal favourite “do I whip out my di**?””. I must point out that criticism comes as much from women as from men.So what’s the deal there? Did such people really forget that the main purpose of breasts is to feed a child and not just for sexual entertainment? Funnily enough, the same people aren’t so shocked when nudity is used to sell you a perfume or when you see women wearing very revealing clothes to go clubbing. Double standards, much? I must point out that I have my own body issues and I am not the type to be super comfortable with my own nudity but I don’t get offended when I see other women’s flesh. I am pretty sure also that when I have kids, I will breastfeed them whenever they need to be fed, being in my own home or in public. I understand that going to the bathroom, having sex etc are also natural things pretty much everyone (me included) would expect you to do in private but I still think they cannot be compared to feeding a hungry child.In a society such as ours, where nudity became so mundane, I find that hard to understand why some people get offended for catching a glimpse of a breast and therefore expect a woman to hide to feed her baby.What are your thoughts?PS: this post is not about promoting breastfeeding. I won’t lie, I personally believe that breast milk is the best you can give to your child and if I can avoid bottle, I will. But at the end of the day, it’s a personal choice and I don’t judge people for not doing it. It’s your opinion on public breastfeeding that I am interested in.
