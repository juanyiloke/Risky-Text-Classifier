New Pension Increase - "The same for ALL"The Prime Minister, David CAMERON, stated that ALL State Pensioners would be paid the same and In Line with Related Earnings!ÊBut, are these statements TRUE?Because it seems that from 11th April 2011 my Pension will be Limited to £137.35±, whereas in certain parts ofLondon and/or The Southeast some Pensioners will be getting an Extra £400.00 per week!Surely this is just another example of the North/South Divide or a different set of Rules for London and The South East, as to those that apply to the Rest of the Country (UK)!Just think, withis increase(?), I could pay off yhe rest of my mortgages in about two (2) years instead of thge nine (9) years that they=re are left to pay.George, Billingham
