interesting article about the dietary guidelines advisory committee (US)Came across this article* the other day, dated Feb. 10th. discussing the newest revision of the US dietary guidelines not having a recommended amount of cholesterol. Nothing new for many of us, and the committee still falls short of addressing the (non)link between cholesterol and heart disease. But I thought it was refreshing to see that this much, at least, has gotten through.But what I really found most interesting about this article was the commentary, very good I thought, about all the conflicting data that's out there, the flip-flopping nutritional advice and how this is normal, expected and even desired in most science fields but the nutrition field gets criticized for it in part because of the attitudes of nutritional-advice-givers. All very astute observations if you ask me! Nice to hear that the people on the scientific community (note that they don't make the actual policy, they are the science advisors to the policy-makers themselves) are more aware of these issues than one is led to believe, given the policy outcomes and the "advice" we get on the ground!(* Note that the Washington Post has a paywall after the first 5 articles you view on their site each month; homepages, section pages, direct links like this one and links from search engines aren't counted though, so use that to your advantage if you browse other articles on the site!)
