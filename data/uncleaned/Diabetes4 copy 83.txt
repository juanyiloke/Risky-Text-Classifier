Have I missed something?I must have missed the announcement, there's a change in appearance and you know how humans hate change. I couldn't come here using my favourites, had to google first. Obviously I set up another favourite, but did I miss something? Quite possible, got lots on my mind, just three and bit weeks for my TKR and the PruHealth have started playing silly whatnames by only paying bits of invoices. I wish they'd do this after the surgery, I spent the best part of three hours trying to find out why only parts of invoices were being paid and why they were allowing surgery to go ahead by withdrawing approval. As somebody who was involved with Organisation and Methods as part of my career in IT, I can say with a fair degree of accuracy that their procedures are appalling. Customer support is good, just as well really. Onwards and upwards.
