I want revengeby cubs » Tue Jun 17, 2014 7:54 pmI am a nurse who is helping other people being abused and it is making me have such a hard time with my past... I am only filled with hate and rage right now. It’s so hard for my mind to see sunshine and happiness. I want revenge. I want them to die so I can celebrate with cake. I want to make sure their graves are covered in piss and $#%^. You see my father drugged me and molested me. His wife would beat me, torture me, not allow me to go to school, told everyone who would come around I had STD’s (this was from age 5-13, maybe even before but I can’t remember) She would call me a @@@@@@@ and a slut. I understand the fact that her husband was having sex with me would make her hate me, but I will never forgive them. I never wanted my father to touch me. It makes me sick. It makes me vomit. I cry thinking about it. I ran away at 13 and was into prostitution and living in shelters until 4 years ago when someone came in my life and showed me I could be better, I am 27 now. I am a nurse who is advocating for abused children now. but its not enough. preventing other kids from my life inst enough. I want revenge. Me not speaking to them isnt giving me satisfaction.. I want to rip out their fingernails I want to hurt them!!!!!!!!! I feel like its the only way I can stop hurting and hating. It isnt fair I cant hurt them like they hurt me.How did you stop feeling this hate for people who have raped and beaten you???
