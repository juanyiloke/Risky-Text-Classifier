Flushing - help please!!!I've been diagnosed type 2 for just over six months now - take sitaglyptin and metformin daily and stick to a reasonably low carb diet with a 5% limit on sugars and saturated fats imposed by my DN.I get the most awful flushes accompanied with a metallic taste in my mouth - both lasting for about five minutes, sometimes during the day and predominantly at night, making me lose sleep as I wake up boiling and prickly hot, throw the duvet off and then ten minutes later really cold and have to cover up again! Its exhausting me and my husband is suffering from my grumpiness!! Does anyone have any solutions please? My DN says the symptoms are not drug related and has no suggestions as to what I can do, but I'm beginning to get to my wits end! HELP!
