Thought of losing my best friend - anxiety getting worsehave struggled with anxiety most of my life (21 now) but recently it has got worse.ÊWe have been best friends since school, eight or nine years and I love her like a sister, her boyfriend is also best friends with my boyfriend.ÊWe go on holiday every year together and have done for probably about four years now.ÊBut recently she's gotten a lot closer to this other girl and it's really worrying me. My anxiety got worse when this couple asked them to go away with them next year. We might still be going away with them too but I felt like that was something that meant something between us that doesn't anymore.ÊWe spend most of our time together and we could go on for hours but now this other couple is asking them to do things all the time.ÊI understand that we have other friends (and I do too) and that's completely normal but i don't think this girl just wants to be another friend, she wants what we have.ÊChange has always made me anxious and I think that's the problem, i've lost the certainty I had before. I always had certainty that on special occasions we ALWAYS do something together but now I can't assume that they'll do something with us. For example, we always do something for new years but this new couple kept asking to do something and my friend said that "we asked first" so they did something with us. I don't want to feel that pressure, as before it wouldn't have even crossed anyone's mind that we wouldn't do something together.ÊI know this may sound childish, it does to me sometimes but it's getting to the point that these thoughts are constantly going round my head and I don't know how to stop them. Whenever something new happens or even just when I'm on my own I feel my heart starting to race, and my stomach is turning, sometimes it feels like someone has punched me in the stomach.ÊI hope this doesn't sound too pathetic to everyone, I just hope that there is someone who has been through or is going throug the same or something similar that may be able to help.The only person I've spoken to is my boyfriend and he is so understanding and really tries to help but as he's never experienced anxiety before it's hard for him to completely get it.ÊI don't want to talk to my friend about it because I know it'll come across sounding ridiculous and may just push her away and make her feel lik she has to hide things from me.
