15.1 this morning and diabetic clinicI'm dreading my diabetic clinic this morning - BGs are all over the place but only when I eat out/gastroparesis plays up or I'm crying, and that's happening a lot because of how I feel about Susie passing away. I'm also not testing as much usual - testing four or five times a day but not as much as I normally do. I'm dreading that the clinic today will want to mess about with my basals but I know that they are ok because when when I don't eat BGs are fine. I know why the BG's are high at certain times but the new consultant is very sarcastic and doesn't listen to me (or my friend who also has him as a consultant). For example, this morning's high BG because was because I was absolutely hating being in the house without Susie last night so we went out for an Indian and I miscalculated the carbs.
