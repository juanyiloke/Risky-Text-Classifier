physical side effect?i've been struggling with anorexia for about 8 years now, but for the last year or so i've had unexplainable eye pain. my eyes ache and feel like there's a lot of pressure behind them, and sometimes i get a sharp, stabbing sensation in them as well. the doctor said my eyes are physically healthy, and i've had several mri's that showed that my brain is physically healthy too, so there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this pain. i've tried EVERYTHING to get rid of it with no luck. could this be a side effect from the 8 years of anorexia? has anyone else experienced this? help!
