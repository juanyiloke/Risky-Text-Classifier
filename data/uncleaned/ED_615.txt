How do I accept my body?Hello, I feel like a bit of a fraud posting here as I consider myself completely recovered from anorexia for a couple of years and am very much a normal healthy weight now (woo go me!). But I'm still constantly struggling with my weight and my body. I feel really fat and incredibly large and I don't know how to accept my body. It's obviously great that I'm healthy now and I never want to go back to where I was, but that doesn't stop me from hating my body.ÊI constantly wear baggy clothes and cover myself up because I feel disgusting. On really bad days I struggle to shower because I can't bear to look at my body. I recently went summer shopping with my friend who pointed out I only liked clothes which were baggy, whereas she liked the clothes on me which were fitted and was quite forceful with me trying on fitted clothes and I had a bit of a breakdown. I realise this isn't a big deal, but it upset me a little because I just felt so overwhelmingly fat.ÊAlthough I'm recovered, I keep going back and forth from restricting to binging/purging and it's awful and although I don't necessarily consider this disordered eating, I feel like I'm constantly battling with myself to eat like a normal person. I have so many contradicting thoughts in my head that I don't know how to deal with.ÊI guess I'm just wondering, how do you accept your body? Is it always going to be a constant struggle? And how if you're recovered do you stay recovered? Any advice or support would be very much appreciate, thank you all so much for reading.
