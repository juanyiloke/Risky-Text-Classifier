Relapsing, Im scaredSo I've been having trouble with eating again...it had been better but about a month or so ago I had to get weighted for a medical exam and although Im still clearly below my average weight expectations, I felt really bad because I had gained about two kilograms. So I started counting calories again and not eating enough :/ÊI try not to think about it much but the truth is that I do miss seeing my ribs and collar bones and everything, and it worries me that I will get to a bad point again. I have been 2 weeks free of self harm and although that's good I feel like it might be contributing to the eating issue, since I guess now Im taking all the feelings out that way...I dont know what to do :( I dont want to make anyone mad and I dont want to get into trouble again but I feel lonely and tired of fighting
