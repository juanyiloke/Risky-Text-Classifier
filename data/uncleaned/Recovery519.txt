  I love you all and I thank you greatlyI cannot thank you guys here enough for all of your support andadvice with the many things I've been going through. I've been going through a rough time but the storm is slowly but surely passing and I see brighter days right around the corner. I've been dealing with not having hope or the will to live and there have been days where I wish I just wasn't alive and that this was all over but your loving support has helped me a lot. I'm thankful I found TTL. This is the greatestcommunity  on the net and the members here are becoming like a family to me. Big hugs to everyone  You guys are awesome!  Making some progressHello everyone :) It's been a little while since I've posted anything so I thought I'd make a smallupdate  on how I've been. Things have been ok. Not thebest  but that's expected sometimes I guess but things are improving. I am back in college. Right now, I am just taking general education classes and some prerequisites to a few programs I'm interested in. My daughter turned 1 a few months ago and is doing very good and recently started walking. I'm also about to start doing freelance graphic design and will have a portfolio site up soon.As of right now, I am still working on getting my own place. That's proving to be quite difficult at the moment but I'm seriously tired of living with my parents. I'm not blaming anyone and I do love and appreciate my parents but I do feel living here is one of the biggest reasons I am unhappy. There's sometimes a lot of friction here especially between me and my mom and I think it's best I just find my own place so I can live my life  the way I want because I still have a lot of child-like restrictions here. Other than that, I'm ok. I hope everyone is doing good
