Asthma for 40 years then a spontaneous remission Living in the Thames Valley (Byfleet, Surrey), I was diagnosed with Asthma aged 8 years which was treated for 10 years with Franol Plus (theophyline) Over the next 30 years again in the Thames Valley (Maidenhead, Berkshire) it was managed more effectively with Ventolin and Becotide. Then divorce and move to Frinton on Sea in Essex for 4 years After 2 years my Asthma disappears! I'm in so called Remission but was warned that my sensitivity to exercise in cold weather followed by warm air would never leave me. Baloney! I'm now a Postman and cycle up steep hills in all weathers (Cold &amp; Dry, Cold &amp; Wet, Cold &amp; Snow) that leave me breathless but still no Asthma. Beyond the knowledge that the Thames Valley is a Respiritory Disease Hotspot and 25years ago a doctor told me to move house preferably 100 miles away. He was right! I'm now Asthma free in Bournemouth 80 miles away from the Thames Valley.How come? Don't know. Nor apparently do the Medical Profession.
