My 11mnth old dd was poorly 2weeks ago and stopped eating completely (took milk though) she is now back to her normal self and was eating fine again (she eats absolutely anything)The last 3days she has been taking her porridge and yoghurts fine but when it comes to her lunch/tea she will take it in her mouth then literally spit it out across the kitchen ננI've always home cooked everything fresh for her which she loves so nothing has changed. And today I got so worried she wasn't getting enough vitamins etc the only way she would take it was by giving her a yoghurt with some of her fresh fish pie on ננ (oh no)Still she sucked off the yoghurt and spat the lumps out (devil) ננThough she did eat majority of it this way!Now she has been her usual self but keeps rolling her tongue (constantly) so wondering could it be that she is teething (currently has one bottom tooth) I'm going to see the health visitor Thursday but just wanted to know if any other parents have had this with food? I'm so worried as I don't want her not eating! Shes a very good well rounded baby (HV words) and very healthy and always has been so this has just kind of confused me. My sister told me to not mix it with her pudding as she will get used to it and keep pursuing with it and she will just 'get used to it again'Any help would be much appreciated ננ
