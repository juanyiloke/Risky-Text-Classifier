stepping down ....yeah! Hello everyone, haven't been on here for some time now, lots going on and no time for myself!Anyway, since my last bad chest infection in April time, where the gp was contemplating long term steroids, my asthma has been brilliant. I've only had symptoms 3-4 times and therefore barely used my ventolin. So I skipped off to the asthma nurse to discuss reducing my medication. I was originally on montelukast and seretide 250, 2 puffs twice a day but had reduced this to 1 puff once a day already (had the flexibility built in with the Gp some time ago to allow increase / decrease dependant on symptoms)I've now been advised to stop montelukast, and have started seretide 50, 2 puffs twice a day with a view to reducing that to 1 puff twice a day.however, I forgot to ask how long I should wait till I reduce it? Any suggestions? What would be my next step after that? My only concern is that I haven't actually had time for much vigorous exercise in the past 6 months with everything that's been going on, and exercise is a trigger for me, so when I start I don't know how my lungs will react. I've also managed to escape any coughs colds etc.
