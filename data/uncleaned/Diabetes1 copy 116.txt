Diabetes and the eyesHi all,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 11 days ago with a fasting glucose level of 13.2 and had a finger test done which was 14.3. The only symptoms I had a the time were migraine headaches and a thirst.The doctor has put me on Metformin, firstly at 500mg but now up to 1000mg per day with diet and exercise. I have managed to lose 8lb in weight in this time. Can I ask if it's normal for my eye sight to deteriorate since being diagnosed and taking the tablets and will it get better once my diabetes gets under control?The reason I ask is for the last 5 days my near vision has become very blurred and I'm having trouble reading and using a computer because of it. My distance vision is fine though.
