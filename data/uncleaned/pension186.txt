For carers of dementia/Alzheimer's sufferersYou may know this but I had missed it until someone came to help me with some other forms for Mum.Under our council rules there is a Council tax discount/exemption for the severely mentally impaired which includes anyone with a dementia/Alzheimer's diagnosis.Ê If you put "Council tax discount/exemption for the severely mentally impaired" and the name of your council in google you should find out about it in your area.A diagnosis should mean the person is exempt from council tax.Ê This makes a spouse, in effect, a single council tax payer so they would get the single discount of 25%.Ê A person living on their own should get complete exemption.Ê If other people than a spouse are living in the house there may still be some discount.
