How would u feel.????So I have been looking for a new job for a while. Finally found one and I applied. I told a few people obviously and told a few mates in work. One asked for the link and some details.Anyway long story short, he applied for the job as well. There is only one position, but the money is excellent and a lot more than we are on now.So I am pissed, but interested what u guys think.ÊIs it fair game.ÊWould u do it to a mate.
