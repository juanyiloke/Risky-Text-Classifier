A few years ago i made a mistake. I was mentally unstable at the time and i did something that i will never forgive myself for. I was arrested, charged and sentenced for it. I never recieced a prison sentence but i wish i had. Instead a news article was put on the internet, on facebook and everyone i care about now knows what i did. My friends want nothing to do with me, my boyfriend broke up with me and cant stand the thought of me, i lost my job and i was run out of my home by my community. Ive lost everything. As far as i am concerned i have nothing left to live for. I will never be able to let new people into my life without the fear of them coming across that news article and placing me right back to square one. I can only see 2 choices ahead of me; either kill myself or live the rest of my life completely alone
