Why is my boyfriend so distant?Ever since I told my boyfriend I have type 1 diabetes (I'm newly diagnosed), he's been acting distant. He was always so chatty and couldn't wait to see me, always making plans, and talking about the future. We're been together for 5 years now, he used to talk about getting married and having children all the time. We're still kind of young, but it never stopped us from dreaming. But, ever since I got back from the hospital (diagnosed with DKA), he hasn't said much and hasn't even asked me out once! I don't want to bring it up because I don't know what he's thinking and would hate to look foolish. Does anyone know what he might be thinking? I know only he knows, but if anyone's had a similar experience, I would love to hear how it turned out.
