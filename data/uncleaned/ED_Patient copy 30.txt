BulimicIm a male who has been bulimic for 11 years and this is the first time ive been on a public forum and just wondered if anyone out there can relate and help me with some moral support? I feel so low with my illness (I hate the word disease) which has been described to me year in year out, but I just feel so lonely and need some support/help as I have tried doctors/counsellors/psychiatrists but ive had no joy as it seemed I was another person on the assembly line. I waited 3 months for an appointment and all he said was "are you still bulimic" "how many times a day?" "ok I'll up your dose of anti depressants" I have been prescribed loads of anti deperassants but I dont take them as I dont want to rely on them as I tried them and they made me feel so sh*t and I couldnt sleep which was horrible as the only time im happy is when im asleep as it makes me escape the need to put my fingers down my throat...its embaressing a grown man has to worry so much about his weight to feel part of this world. I was bullied for being fat and I lost so much weight so I could 'fit in' and I have lost my weight but ive paid the biggest price of all by having this illness that restricts me from eating normally and enjoying food like a normal person and also going out for meals in public which I cant do as I dont want to embaress myself even more by going to the toilet after. This life sucks and I wish I could swap it for anyone else's but saying that I wouldnt wish this on anyone else. Can someone please talk to me and be my friend on this subject as Ive lost a good few friends due to them not wanting to associated with 'someone who makes themself sick'Anyways rant over and my email is ______
