Hi,DH and I have been living in the UK for almost 10 years now.... We have a 2.5 yo DS. My parents live in India and are currently here to spend some time with DS.... The last time they saw DS he was barely a year old and one of the reasons I wanted them to spend some time here was because I wanted them to bond with DS....I love how close they have become in the past few weeks... And it makes me very sad to think that they will be gone soon and may not get to see DS for another year. I try and go to India every year, but that is just a short holiday and my parents will not get to spend a lot of time with DS when I'm in India....So lately it's got me thinking if I should move back... Because it is important for DS to have that bond.... But both my parents and DH don't think it's practical to move countries just because I'm being emotional..... And frankly if you asked me, I am happy here.... My parents are the only reason I would ever consider going back.... I am very close to them...When I see other kids around here spending weekends with GPs, I do get envious....I am not even sure what I'm expecting as an answer to this post.... I guess I just wanted to share this and get an independent view.....Sorry about the long post....TIAÊ
