1 year has passed, thank you all!At the beginning of this month, a year since my diagnosis has passed. I wanted to thank everyone on this forum, you've done so much for me, have been such a great help! Thanks to all of you I have not listened to the ridiculous of the advice from my hospital team, read "Think like a pancreas" twice, was lucky enough to be able to get myself a CGM, reduced my carb intake and lowered my HbA1c from 112 mmol/mol (on initial diagnosis) to 31 mmol/mol (last month). I managed to rebuild muscles I lost before diagnosis, got 2 cataracts operations and a laser correction. After a year I think I can say that I finally feel like myself again. It's been a tough year and I got through it thanks to all of you! I'm not sure if I could have done it without the great help and support from this forum. My partner keeps saying how surprised he is how good I handled all that came  So, once again, THANK YOU ALL. You probably saved my life (literally)!
