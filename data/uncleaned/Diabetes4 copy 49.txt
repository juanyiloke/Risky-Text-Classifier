Hello Darlings, holidays and BG and all that jazzHaven't been on here for a while. Got a dressed crab for my xmas dinner. Took it out of the freezer. Behold a large insect! Couldn't face it. Chucked it on the fire. Couldn't even deal with it enough to give it to the dogs. Ended up with an omelette for xmas dinner. I made a low carb lime syllabub for pud. Managed 2 spoonfuls.  Revolting!, just cannot stand the taste of splenda.Now..... sugar has only 4.5g carb per tsp and I don't have a sweet tooth, why don't low carb recipes use it in small quantities? Ditto cheese sauce using a little flour for thickener? Why do we have to have industrial chemicals in our food? Low carb recipes have gone too far in the other direction.We need a new recipe concept.Have lost over 5 stone now. Not stopping for xmas!! Allowed myself an extra 10g carb on xmas day and boxing day. How obsessive is that?!!Are you all in carb hell at the moment?
