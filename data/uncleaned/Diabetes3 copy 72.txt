One step nearer insulin. :)Had my meds changed around a month ago to come off gliclazide   as I was not doing to well on it. I was back at the docs again today as I have been hitting the 20's again not good  As the new meds are not working I have been put back om gliclazide along with metformin and sitagliptin. Got talking about insulin and may be a chance of switching on to it, as I am now maxed out in the DN's opinion due to my intolerance to medications on before switching to insulin.She even disscussed the difference between mixed and bolus / quick acting insulin.   Even agreed that the mixed insulin was not the option for me.Only snag is she was a locum nurse and might not be here in a month when she wants me to return for another check up.So near and yet far away from being switched over to insulin. Looks like another rough month ahead of myself seeing how I react to the triple load of meds.I just now need to convince the docs that insulin could be the best option for me. Just have my doubts that the docs won't let me switch over to insulin.Is there any further ways to convince the docs I would be better off on ininsulin?
