Quick question as I'm trying to work out how to deal with this while kids are out! About a month ago DS1 lost a tenner of his birthday money. After briefly asking everyone in the house if they knew anything about it, cue discussion about carelessness, money doesn't grow on trees etc. etc. Then this morning, DS2 (12) is getting some money out to go to the shops & - lo! - DS1 recognises his tenner with the biro mark in the corner & (understandably) goes ballistic.ÊDS1 in floods of tears saying he knows he should have spoken up at the time but he knew we'd be cross etc. Clearly, that would have been nothing compared to with how cross I am about it now!How would you handle this situation? I've kind of left it for now for them to talk about it among themselves but I feel I have to do something about it - not only the stealing but the lying. I feel really upset & wonder what else he might have done that I don't know about!Any advice welcome. xxx
