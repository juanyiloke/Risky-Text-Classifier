Êdo I have an ED?I've suffered from depression for around three years now but the last few months things have improved and I've found myself feeling a little more like I used to. One thing has been plaguing me for a while now though and that's my relationship with food. For as long as I can remember I've had an odd relationship with food, calorie counting and depriving myself since a young age. I diet and then end up binging. Purging my food is a more recent occurrence which has happened over the last few months and I'm worried it may be the early signs of some kind of bulimia. Or am I just over reacting? Do I need some help with my eating or is this fairly common. I'm a 19 year old girl if this helps answer my question.
