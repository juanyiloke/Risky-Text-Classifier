Am i Anorexic?I have checked my BMI and it says im at 16.12, im 22 yrs old, 5ft7 and weighing just under 7 an a half stone. I have been told im under weight during a check up a couple if months ago due to another health problem. Nothing els was said about my weight. I have metnioned it to doctors in the past when seeing about other medical issues but the subject seems to change. I get hair loss and have noticed i have been eating less due to feeling sick after eating or to the point i cant eat alot due to feeling sick. I get cold very easy. I can stand outside for an hour and my whole body shakes and its come to the point once where i have gotten chest pain from feeling so cold. If its summer i still get cold skin even if i feel hot. I have been tol my hands become freezing even if its summer. Anyone think i have anorexia? I would just like peoples opinions before taking it further. thank you
