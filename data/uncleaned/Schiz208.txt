The way you use this forum,is it helping you or stopping you to move forward in life??Last Friday.i message a friend and posted a link to this forum,my intention was to let him read one of my post and hopefully he can read it and give me some suggestion and advice.He got angry and asked me to move on and said I should stop visiting this forum.I was suppose to visit him in Singapore the next day,but he messaged me and said I should only visit him "when I think I am not ill",so we cancelled the meetup/meeting.He is a guy whom I knew when I go to the support group at the hospital,not from the online meetup.I still had the very habit to go to this forum,maybe he is right,i might not be so ill if I didn't visit this forum very often...
