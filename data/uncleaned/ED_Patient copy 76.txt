Anorexic binge, please help. am 23 and for the past year I have been battling with anorexia. In the last 2 months or so it's gotten really bad and I have become totally obsessed. I only eat a couple of apples/raw carrots during the day and then a salad or something for dinner. If I can't make it to the gym I freak out to the point where I feel sick with anxiety. I have become sneaky with my food and lie to my family and friends about how much I've eaten. I have always been slim but people around me are getting increasingly concerned about my drastic weight loss, and are encouraging me to put on more. Tonight I have just binge eaten to the point where I physically want to hurt myself. I am completely distraught at what I've eaten and my stomach is in bits; ice cream, chocolate, cake - you name it, i've eaten it. I can't move from my bed - both frozen in disgust and because i am physically in so much pain from my bloated stomach. I am crying and absolutely freaking out. I know this isn't normal behaviour and has made me realise how completely unhealthy my relationship with food has become. I don't want to be this person anymore....but neither do I want to gain any weight. I have no idea why I am posting here but I just need some help/advice....(and for someone to tell me that this binge won't have ruined everything I've worked so hard for) Please help.
