Foreskin back or not?Howdy all,I tried searching for similar threads but couldn't find anything.ÊI went to get a routine STI check recently and the doctor said I should keep my foreskin pulled back as its more hygienic. I'm 32 and never had any problems with hygien down there, I always pulled it back and washed it everyday etcJust wondering what's the general consensus and what do ye guys do? I'm happy with it forward and don't really want to change.ÊCheers.
