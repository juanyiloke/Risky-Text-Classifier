Moving forwardFeeling very depressed today.  But reflecting on all the things I want to change.  I wrote this the other day, for personal inspiration (sorry I'm no poet)May this be a time of positive change, of renewed strength and personal growth.Of letting go and moving forward..Of forgiveness, compassion and a new found love of life.Let this be a time of inner peace, mindfulness and gratitude.May you open your heart and mind to all the beauty that life brings.May you have the wisdom to seeand the passion to beall that you are.I hope this year brings positive change for everyone. :)
