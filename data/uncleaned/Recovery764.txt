writing helpsi have had depression for a long time but after a marriage break up 20 years ago the depression really peaked. i was eventually hospitlised. it was then one sunny morning while leaning against a colum in the hospital , thinking i have only got 20 cents in my pocket and yet previous i ran a business and turned over a quarter of a million dollars per year. strange but i started to laugh and thought i have to write about this. so off i go i asked the nurse for an A4  sheet and a pencil. that was the start of my writing and boy did i give the pencil some work.. this would lead to me publishing a book in 2008 and having my photo in the paper in the north and south of western australia.even if you start writing about your life and dont want to publish give it to your grand kids or someone close so they would know your feelings and what you got up to in your life .?  a lot of comedians and famous singers have suffered depression. cheers . les
