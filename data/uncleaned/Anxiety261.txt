Suddenly visible veins??For the last 5 months or so, my veins have been very visible at times. The first time it happened was after I was sitting still working for 10 hours. I noticed it in my hands and had an instant panic attack. Every since then the veins in my hands, arms, and legs have been showing more. The veins in my hands bulge while the rest do not. I am not sure if it is in my head or not, but i get pain in my hands as well.It seems to be worse after a shower, sit for awhile or first thing when I wake up. I am worrying and I know this isn't helping my anxiety. I am 27 by the way and other than my blood pressure running lower than the average person, everyone tells me I am healthy. I do have skin flushing, like I have slight rosacea and kertosis pilaris on my legs.ÊMy question is, can anxiety cause this? Or maybe not moving enough? I am not fat or skinny, I am probably 10 pounds heavier than I should be but I carry it in my butt and legs so my upper body, specially my arms and wrists are small. I drink enough water most days and eat pretty healthy. I don't drink soda or anything with caffeine. I don't even use over the counter pain meds or cold meds. I am very weird about what goes in my body.ÊOther than probiotics, vitamin c, and vitamin D3, I don't take anything. When this first started, I wasn't taking anything though.ÊPlease someone ease my mind with this. I have been waking up feeling short of breath from either anxiety or acid reflux, which either was is do to stress.
