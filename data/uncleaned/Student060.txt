So Unhappy.. help/advice needed!by hker96I've posted not too long ago about my 'friends group' leaving me feeling isolated and alone. Things have not gone any better - in fact, they've gotten worse.Found out that several of the girls in the group are not true friends (strategically planning to upset me, leaving me out, trying to ruin my relationship, etc) and I am so confused about what to do next.I've signed on to live with them next year in self-catered. I'm trying to pull out of the contract though and plan to live somewhere else (in self-catered with random people.. although it's so late now so I would be lucky to get into a flat at all.. have heard bad things about late applying), however I'm not too keen on this either because I have met nobody at my university who seems like a true friend, so it's hard to be enthusiastic.This situation really makes me want to change universities and although it seems like I'm running away from things, it's been a terribly long time, I'm not just in a few petty arguments, I know that these people aren't my friends. And from experience trying to make new ones hasn't gone well either. My course is nice but I am not enjoying it as much as I planned, so it's not like I can just fully immerse myself in it.Sorry for the mouthful. Any advice would be appreciated! Ta!
