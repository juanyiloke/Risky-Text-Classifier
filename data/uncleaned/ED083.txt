extreme hungerhi, I'm a new member and have only started to eat for weight gain in the last week. I have only had anorexia for a year but had dropped to a new low last weekend and knew that i had to get it under control. But i have noticed that i have this kind of extreme hunger and i only describe it as sort boredom eating. i don't know whether to indulge and just put on weight faster and that it will disappear when my body realises that i won't starve it again. or if this is just a type of binge eating?? have any of you guys experienced this? please help :(
