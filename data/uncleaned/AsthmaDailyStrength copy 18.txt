I have been searching for diagnostic answers and relief since mid-August when fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pressure hit. I had been healthy with no prior lung issues. To suddenly never have a full breath of oxygen despite O2 levels being fine and heart checking out okay still was scary. Lung function tests were near normal and I never wheezed or breathed quickly. I had deep slow inadequate breaths. Eventually my dr tried me on Advair and I got some better in first month. Based on improvement, he wants me to stay on it for now. Does this even sound like asthma. My knowledge is limited with no personal or family history. Smells have always bothered me--- like cleaning products and some sprays. I think I am allergic to dust and smoke. But I just avoid stuff that bothers me. Does it make sense to suddenly not be able to breathe with no exposure changes? I might have some other stuff going on with me, but dr is calling this my first asthma flare up---at 49?
