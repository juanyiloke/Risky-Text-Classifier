Visit to DSNWell duly turned up armed with determination.  Nursie was in a good mood today and I didn't need anything like the amount of determination I thought I'd need.Yes, cholesterol 5.4  HDL 1.7  LDL 3.2 Trigs 1.2 so a bit higher than usual.  Started the statin talk and I said she would have to pin me down on the ground and force feed them to me and then I'd spit them out.  She thought that was quite funny and actually said 'Colette, don't take them'.  I assured her I wouldn't.All results good.  HbA1c was great according to her at 50.  Told her it wasn't great in my eyes and that I would be going back on Metformin and that I was considering upping the dosage a bit.  She was adamant I shouldn't do that.  We agreed that it was really up to me to look after myself in the next year while I'm in Spain.  She then wanted to do a test for the probability of heart problems and I came out at 20%.  She said that was impossible;  all my results pointed to far lower percentage of probability.  She thought it might be that there was heart problems in the family and that I had once been a smoker.  Either way she  said the result was ridiculous and not to pay attention to that one!!!  All in all a good visit.  Didn't have the heart to talk about strips, that was just my fall back which I didn't need.Aw well, off the Espagna with all my bits in working order.
