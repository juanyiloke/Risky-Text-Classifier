GastroparethisHi all, been to see DSN today for insulin review, started it in November. Whilst there she mentioned a problem I had told her about a while ago, ie, nausea, bloating and at my worst, passing out and vomiting. I have been tested for coeliac and that came back negative. She has done some research and spoke to my GP and they are now thinking gastroparethis. This is probably due to the surgery I had to remove 2/3 of my pancreas 7 years ago (hence being diabetic). I am going back in 3 weeks and I may have to see a specialist or they may try me on some drugs. Has anyone on here any experience of this? Many thanks, Elaine.
