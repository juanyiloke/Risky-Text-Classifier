  I'm doing so well, financiallyI'm not here to brag about stuff but I just wanted toshare  this. 2013 kicked off on an awesome note. I'm not going to share details here but by the end of January, I might be looking at well over $400 per month.I'm in college right now and where I live, I can live a lavish lifestyle  with that kind of money. It is all legit and I plan on paying taxes too. :)Moreover, I have felt like a failure all my life  because of my failures academically and it was one of the things that triggered my depression . But I tried very hard and things have finally started to pay off. I'm so excited!Wish I was in a better place emotionally and in life so I could celebrate it and just... feel as big as I should.Anyway, thanks for all the love and support. Hanging on...
