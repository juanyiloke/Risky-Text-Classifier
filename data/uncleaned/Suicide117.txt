No one would careThe only person I care about is my girlfriend. And I don't think she'd care if I killed myself. I mean she'd feel bad because then she wouldn't have anyone to hang out with any more. But once she replaced me I think she'd be totally over it. My friends, same thing, and anyway, I don't really care if they'd miss me or not. I'm just a burden on my mom. She'd be thrilled to get rid of me.ÊI desperately try to get people to like me, but I'm never anyone's priority. Like yeah I'm okay to talk to if no one else is around but they don't think of me as a real friend. I'm not important to them.ÊI have to go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and I'd rather murder her than sit through another appointment. I hate her so much. She's so arrogant, she refuses to listen to me when I say what's working and what isn't. She doesn't care if she helps me as long as she gets paid. She gets pissed off if I dare imply that she doesn't know everything.I try to go out and socialize but I'm too shy to talk to anyone. I'm fat, ugly and on disability, and I live with my mother, so, you know, I don't make a good first impression when you realize I'm also awkward and not good at conversation.I'm going to end up alone and be alone forever. No one would miss me and I don't want to live like that.
