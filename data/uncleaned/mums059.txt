My 3 week old doesn't feed well and I'm loosing my mindHe didn't latch onto breast so I expressed for the first week and then my milk started to dry up so I put him on formula (aptamil)ÊHe feeds, but doesn't sound comfortable then after feed he looks like he's straining but he does pass loose stools so it can't be constipation ?He grunts,cries and struggles until he vomits/projectile vomits and then he'll sleep for about an hour and then it's back to square one. I'm worn outHelp
