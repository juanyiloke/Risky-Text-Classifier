  Brick by brick, step by stepI wasn't sure where to post this, but yesterday I made an important step in my life : I told my mother I neededhelp .I told her about my anorexia and depression, how several others things could be wrong with me and that I wanted to be tested. She agreed to make an appointment with our personaldoctor  and took it all pretty well. I felt relieved, but also anxious. It was my first time opening up, but now the door has been opened to a better life where I can feel well about myself.
