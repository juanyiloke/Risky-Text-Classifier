Newly Diagnosed - Confused on Prescriptions Just been diagnosed and unsure about repeat prescriptions Hi Everyone,I've recently been diagnosed with Asthma. Been given a Clenil Modulate 100 preventer and Salbutamol Reliever. I take 4 puffs a day of the Clenil, which will run out just before christmas. My asthma nurse has told me to stop taking the Clenil if I don't have any symptoms after 6 weeks to see if my Asthma is just effected by pollen, as suspected. However, the 6 weeks end just before Christmas week and if I do need a new prescription of it, I'll have to order it a week or so before to ensure I get it before I go home for Christmas (I'm at university).Could someone explain to me how to get repeat prescriptions of inhalers? Do they come as just the canisters when it's a repeat? I'm a bit confused and over-whelmed by all of this.Also when does the Salbutamol inhaler run out? I can't find an expiration date on it anywhere.Any help would be greatly appreciated!Thank You!
