what exactly is wrong with me?I feel depressed but I don't know what's wrong with me. I have no energy no want to do anything, I'm so tired, I eat way to much like I'm never actually full. I need some help from anyone. And I'll also give you more of a story. I moved out of my gmaws which is who I consider my mom cause my real mother verbally abused me and everyone else. I was always called worthless am when I tried to date I was a whore and she wanted money and blah blah. Then I meet my soul mate, and I got pregnant, and then my real mother destroyed us. As soon as I hit 18 I left her house and me an my son moved in with my soul mate, a few months later we were married. One of the happiest days of my life except my son being born. Then I got pregnant again and August 2014 our daughter was born. Another perfect angel. But I have always had depression for as long as I can remember I have had it but it get worse and worse, my husband is never home he works out of state 10 days and only home for 4 days, I don't have my license so I stock up before he leaves and I don't go anywhere for 10 days and barley go outside, I feel trapped, I'm trying to get my license but I suck butt at parallel parking a truck. And the past week I don't even want to clean the house. I want to lay around and cuddle with the kids, I don't want to move. But of course I force myself to cause no matter how sad I get I won't hurt my kids. So if someone could help me get a little energy I'd greatly appreciate it! !
