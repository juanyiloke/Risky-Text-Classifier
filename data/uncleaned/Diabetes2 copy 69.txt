New to the forum and metformin   Hello all. I am a 57 yr old woman with a range of health problems.Until 2 years ago I was as fit as a fiddle and then i stopped smoking. Just after that I was diagnosed as having arterial sclerosis, and Sleep aponea (severe - I stopped breathing on average 86 times an hour) - I sleep with a CPAP machine now, and about 6 months ago during a routine hospital visit my arterial specialist mentioned that I have a glucose intolerance and was "pre diabetic" - but dont worry about it". I went to my own GP who did blood tests and I was diagnosed type 2. Foe the last 6 months it has been diet and Exercise but yesterday they put me on metformin 500mg, 2 a day - one at breakfast and one with my evening meal.Soooo, What can i expect from this wonder drug?
