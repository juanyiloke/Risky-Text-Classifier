How effective is my revision technique for law?by RatachI have 4 modules to revise for, each having 25 lectures and 9 tutorials. I have attended most tutorials but my lecture notes are rubbish. Here goes my genius plan:- Listen to 6 lectures per day to be done with all of them in two weeks, handwriting notes in the process.- Skim through assigned tutorial reading on corresponding lecture topics and write model answers to all tutorial questions (consulting resources if necessary)- Rewrite lecture notes again and again and again until my hands literally can't take it or I can recite the whole thing like a parrot- Make flashcards on key cases nearer the exam period- Pray for the best even though I'm non-religiousWhat do you think?
