Sugar Daddies and sugar angelsThere was a feature on last week's Late Late show about a variation of dating agencies that facilitated where wealthy men could basically "buy" beautiful girlfriends who are happy to be with these men as long as they are lavished with gifts, money and all sorts of material things.ÊI'm just curious about the mindset of men who have to buy love. I'm not talking about hiring a hooker for a ONS - I'm talking about having a long-term relationship with someone who you know is only with you because of your financial generosity. Even outside of the extreme example above with this sugar angel thing, there are many men across Ireland who are known to be with "gold diggers" and these men know their partners intentions where it's very obvious but are still happy to accommodate.ÊSurely something must not ring true, knowing the only reason that person is with you is because of the money? Does it suggest low self esteem on the part of the man or is it that such issues as esteem don't matter as long as you're getting the action on tap or whatever? Is it the way different men are programmed as I could not look at myself in the mirror if I knew my partner wouldn't look twice at me if I wasn't loaded?I'm sure there are role reversals also of wealthy women and attractive male opportunists so I'm not trying to be sexist or presumptious here.Would love to hear the opinion of a gent here who knows this is the set up of their relationship and why they do it....or would their silence confirm that they acknowledge it's all rather pathetic really?
