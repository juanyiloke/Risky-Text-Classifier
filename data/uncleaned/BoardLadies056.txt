What's it like to date an only child (boy)?Have you been in a long term relationship with an only child man?ÊHow do you deal with the family dynamic when his parents are very dependant on him emotionally? There is also an element of his mother seriously mammying him which he gets somewhat annoyed with but doesn't object to because he doesn't want to hurt her feelings.ÊIf it's any information, the mother wears the pants in this house and the father has a mental illness, hence no voice in the house.
