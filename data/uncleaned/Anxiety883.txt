Anxiety and PanicHi All.I've had to come home from uni today after suffering the longest bout of panic / anxiety I've ever experienced. It started totally out of the blue with me feeling a bit too hot and spiraled from there. My heart was racing, I felt sick and I was terrified that something awful was about to happen to me. I can't get an appointment with my gp until Tuesday and in the meantime I don't know what to do. I've got Mirtrazipine here but im scared to take it. I feel like I'm going crazy. Can someone please help me ?ÊThankyou so much x
