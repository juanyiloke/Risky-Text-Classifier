decisions regarding surgery¥	 Hi all,¥	I am nearing the end of my chemo ...woohoo!  Now I need to decide about my surgery. I met the consultant today who spoke to me about the various options. I have been told that I will have a mastectomy. I will also need radiation after the surgery. So now the big decision is about reconstruction. Do I want to have it along with the mastectomy or at a later stage. Both options seem to have their own pros and cons. Can people who have had it either way please tell me about their experience? I feel I don't want to have two surgeries but at the same time I don't want the radiation to cause any damage to my new breast. ¥	Thanks¥	Ramya.
