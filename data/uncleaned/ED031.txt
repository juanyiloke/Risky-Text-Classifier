Terrified-- starting IOP next week, need reassuranceHey, all.I've only recently accepted that one of the things "wrong" with me is an eating disorder.I've basically always had trouble with food, generally highly restrictive behaviors with a few other features, but since I've always been overweight, I figured it wasn't a "real" eating disorder, just someone who didn't know what was good for her.Anyway, I started with a new therapist, and both she and my partner came together to help me understand that what I'm doing is disordered eating of a pretty severe level. Even -if- I'm over weight, restricting to the point that I don't have a period is classic behavior.At any rate, the point is that they've worked with me to go through the process to start and IOP program at a local recovery facility, and I'm scared out of my mind.I'm looking for reassurance-- it won't be that bad, it won't be what I think, it won't make me worse.I'm specifically terrified of a few things1) Meeting with a dietitian. All the ones I've known have been basically terrible people (I work in the nutrition field, of all things, so I've met quite a few). I'm really afraid of what she'll say to me.2) Eating meals in front of other people. I don't do this, if I can help it, even with my partner, but it's part of the program. If anything makes me consider NOT doing it, it's this element.3) Being the only clinically over weight woman there. I know this is a silly, stereotypical response, but I can't -help- it.Reaching out here. Someone tell me I'm psyching up for nothing, that it will be good, anything...
