cancer awareness

There appears to be a Women's craze gripping my Facebook Homepage at the minute, girls taking selfies...wait for it...with no make up on.
Why oh why are such extremities being undertaken I hear you ask?
Why it's all in the name of breast cancer awareness see.
A noble idea but I didn't see any mention of a donation anywhere.

So here's my thinking...
We men put on a hape of make up, take a selfie, put it up on Facebook, and tag every lad we know encouraging them to do the same. We can then rest soundly, safe in the knowledge we're doing our bit to promote testicular cancer awareness.

Daft?
