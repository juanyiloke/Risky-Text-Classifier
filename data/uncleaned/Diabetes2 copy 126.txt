Accu Chek mobile stripless bs monitorI have received the above this morning.  Anyone any experience of using this one.  I chose it for my husband as it had good reviews and is stripless however I did not realise that the lancets and cassettes needed are so expensive.  I have had to order more lancets as it only came with 12 which are single use only.  My husband had difficulty in getting a drop of blood out but did eventually and and got a reading of 11 just before lunch which I think shocked him a bit and he is talking about changing his diet. So far so good.
