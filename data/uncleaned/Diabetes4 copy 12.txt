The Truth About Low Carb DietsI have just bought Jenny Ruhl's 2012 book "Diet 101: The Truth About Low Carb Diets". (Amazon £9.25)  I came across this website: http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/sp3index.php  I found it very helpful up to a point and then saw the book "The Truth About Low Carb Diets" advertised on the site and thought it looked even more interesting.  After debating whether I should buy yet another book on diabetes, I decided to send off for it from Amazon, as I still have a lot of unanswered questions relating to my diabetes.The book came yesterday afternoon and I am gradually making my way through it.  The only downside to the book is that it is written for people in the USA so I have to convert mg/dL to mmol/L.   The author does say to divide the mg/dL by 18 to get the British figures!  Methinks I will find it easier if I had a calculator to hand. Having so far only read the 11 page Introduction and the first chapter, I can see the book will be exceptionally helpful and should answer all my queries.  It is quite technical in its content and does have a lot of facts and figures.   I wondered if anyone on here has read this book and I would be interested to see your comments about it.   I would certainly recommend it.
