puzzled! !!¥	Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting to question my treatment for bc since I joined this site  (bit late now ). Most, not all, seem to have chemotherapy first to shrink their tumour which negates the need for mastectomy which seems like a good idea to me, however I had surgery first then chemo  (masectomy ). My lump was only 2 cm and at that time only knew i was estrogen positive. When my pathology report came back I was found to have multi focal tumours, 2 of them, both non invasive unlike the one that measured 2cm which was picked up via a mammogram, also 1 lymph node involvement and herceptin positive hence chemo, I'm not saying mastectomy was the wrong decision for me, in light of the 2 multi focal tumours, it was probably a good thing, however when the consultant advised a mastectomy he didn't know all this, so I'm left wondering why he made this decision on what he only knew at the time to be a 2cm, estrogen positive tumour. ¥	Next concern is that everyone here seems to have had a different regimen of chemotherapy than me. I only had EC chemo and herceptin was not introduced until four weeks after treatment, unlike all you herceptin positive ladies who had yours towards the latter end of your FEC and TAX chemo. ¥	Think I need George or misty on this one, so if either of you are out there in cyberspace please shed some light if you can, I'm a bit worried that my hospital have done things on the cheap and maybe they are of the mindset 'if in doubt chop it off ' sorry for this super long post x
