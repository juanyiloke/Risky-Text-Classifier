She was just 22 year old, slim (size 6-8) she struggles to keep her weight up to 7st 10lbs, she is 5'4&quot;, she keeps very fit by walking to university each day - 2 mile walk each way, swims and fences. She has never smoked and eats a VERY healthy diet. She was feeling very ill, had weight loss and finally kept fainting. Eventually she was admitted to the wards for tests - being a medical student she was well attended to. It was a long time before she was diagnosed with IGT and low blood pressure. She manages her condition by keeping all sugar out of her diet, eats things like porridge and brown rice for slow release carbs and walks at lunch time to keep her blood pressure up. She has fantastic self discipline to manage her diet and life style. She does not seem to follow the usual profile of being overweight and unfit - in fact quite the opposite. Are thee others who have a similar profile?
