Stage 4 Lung Cancer 1 metastasisI've been diagnosed with stage 4. A PET Scan cinched it. I have one metastasis to the upper part of my breastbone. I'm being treated at Duke Raleigh Hospital. I started treatment on April 21. They have prescribed 6 weeks of radiation with 6 days of chemo at the beginning and end of the radiation, the chemo days being concurrent with the radiation.I just finished the first round of Chemo. The nausea now is a problem. when I swallow everything, food or drinks, seem to stick in the back of my throat and nothing feels like it's going down. It might be the feedback from my esophagus lacking since I was told the radiation would likely mess up the esophagus which is right under the breastbone. I tried a coke today hoping the bubbles would kick it loose. So far it hasn't. I still feel like there's a wad of stuff at the back of my throat that simply won't go down. This is new. While doing the chemo I didn't have serious nausea. I just finished the first round of Chemo yesterday, Day 1 was CISplatin and Etoposide. days 2-5 were Etoposide with day 6 being CISplatin again, alone. During those days I didn't seem to have as severe nausea. They were feeding me several IV bags, some being called "pretreatment" Perhaps I still need those?I was prescribed some pills, Morphine 15 MG ER for the bone pain in my breastbone taken 2X per day, Lorazepam (AKA Atavan) and Ondansettron for nausea, 1 every 8 hrs or as needed. So far the nausea meds haven't seemed to help at all.Several friends have suggested marijuana but I have no trust, faith or belief in that so I refuse to try it. I have no desire to die as a junkie. I am looking for legitimate, medically accepted methods. One friend did suggest nausea patches. I'm open to that idea as well as herbs known to help digestion that might help.Your thoughts, suggestions?
