ÊAnxietyHi all. I was diagnosed as having DID 20 years ago. I am now 63. I went to therapy for a few years, but decided to stop a number of years ago. I would have severe anxiety when ever I saw the therapist. I still have severe anxiety and don't know what to do. Even writing on here is causing a lot of anxiety. Another 'symptom' I have has to do with my eyes. Almost every day my eyes will shift like a slide show. I call it flipping frames. Does anyone else have their eyes do this?
