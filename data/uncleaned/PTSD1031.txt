Hello everyone- I'm wondering if anyone has tried Clonidine for trauma. If so, i was wondering if you could share the side effects and success (or failure) that you've had with this. I am suffering from severe hypervigilance. (There is a trauma expert who treated the kids from Waco (the Branch 'Davidian's') and many others and he has used Clonidine with some of his patients/clients). I have an opportunity to try this med. but I am always leary of new medications as I'm pretty drug-sensitive. Would love to hear from anyone who has tried it. Thanks
