Need some advice - Starting a business, fiancee wants to be a "partner"...2013-11-11, 09:08 PMI have a pretty cool fiancee. She's a great person. Very trustable, submissive yet smart. We are in our 20's and I am ready to start my first business. My basic problem is this:I have done the logistics. I've done the research, planning, funding, making of contacts, and overall dreaming of the business i plan to get into. The business has great profit potential and it could be the springboard in need to start more stores, thus achieving my dreams of a successful (and wealthy) multi-business owner. My problem is She has said, and i quote: "I will always support you but I want to be a boss. I want to be partners because we are partners in life, there will be no hiding money, it'll be a OUR bank account".Luckly this was said over text message, because immediately my inner RED ALERT went off. Firstly, who does this woman think she is making demands? I am the one whos done all the most of the planning and funding. I believe that i, as the investor and breadwinner, should be the one who controls my hard earned money. She can get what i give her. I am a very generous person and would like nothing more to be the provider for her nice things. However, I feel like the man should have the power. And money = power. Im not sharing my power with her. This is my life dream. So how do secure my money without obviously confronting her and telling her no. I believe she is entitled to something, because i do expect her to work long hours until we can afford to hire employees. It will be very demanding and we will be relocating to another state. So yes it will be hard on her.What do I do?
