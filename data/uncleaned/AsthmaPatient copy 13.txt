Montelukast - blue pills  2  This might seem silly, but I'm wondering if there is any difference between that Montelukast tablets I was taking (which were orange/brown in colour) and the ones I have that came with my last repeat prescription, which are blue. Both are Montelukast 10mg. I know that different drug companies produce drugs with different packaging but these blue tablets seem to be giving me a side effect. About an hour after taking them I feel strangely disconnected and I think I might even have had short black outs. This feeling reoccured every few minutes and lasted a couple of hours, I've stopped taking for the time being but my asthma is quite bad at the moment.
