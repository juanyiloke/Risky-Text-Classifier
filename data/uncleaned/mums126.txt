Im really concerned about dd and school. Dd is nearly seven and in year two. She has never had any time off until just before the easter holidays when she was off ill for a week with a nasty virus. Since she went back it has been a nightmare. She starts when she goes to bed screaming and crying she doesnt want to go, this goes on till she eventually falls asleep at about half eleven, then starts again at fiveish the next morning.When we get to school, she cries and refuses to go in, I have to physically take her in, hand her to a teacher and leave.It has started gettting worse over the past few days, it is getting harder and harder to get in her in, and while she is at school she is crossing her arms, pouting and stamping her feet at the teachers and shouting get me my mum now, refusing to engage in activities, eat her lunch or anything.Me and dh have spoken to her extensively about this, at first she was saying things like her friends wont play with her, she cant do the work etc all of which arent true, we have been into school a few times and they have said she has loads of friends she just refuses to play with any of them. She quite behind for her year but always been and it has never bothered her before, they dont make a big deal of it neither do we.ÊA few of the teachers, dinner ladies etc and the head have spoken to her and asked what the problem is but she just says she misses me and nothing else. I just dont know what to do. Ive tried talking to her, taking things off her, ignoring the crying, being sympathetic but nothing works.we are all shattered including ds who is 9 and hasnt had a good nights sleep since the easter holidays because of the tantrums on a night and we are all miserable because of it.I dont know whether she is trying it on or there is something more serious afoot!
