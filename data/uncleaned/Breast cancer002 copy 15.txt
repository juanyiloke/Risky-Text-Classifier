Bit of a shock¥	just returned from my second opinion appt and went private for it. Some of u know my story, unknown primary site but treated as bc. Well further tests now show its skin cancer. Trying to get my head round it, can't believe this, it means all sorts of things about the treatment I've received till now. Thank God I didn't do the RT. I even saw a dermatologist who ruled it out last August. Now I'm being referred on to another hospital whereas I thought I was looking at the finishing line. Feeling numb, like I did at first diagnosis.
