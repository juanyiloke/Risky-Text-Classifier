  3 days okay________________________________________Hello,I've been fine for 3 days now. I haven't had suicide thought. Before that I was in a bad state but somehow all the self help stuff I was doing and with the help of my friend I am living with, friends far away from me and friends here, I got through to the other side. This feeling of being free from depression have been one of the most amazing experiences I've had.This is the second time I'm out of depression. First time was when I was 19. I'm 45 now. These 8 years have been very painful for me. This time was rough as I lost everything I had except for friends. Now, I need to rebuild my life as I really have nothing...no money, in huge debt, and no family to support me through life. I don't know where to post about this as most of the site is to help people get through their crisis. I don't know if this feeling is going to last long term or it might be I'm bipolar. I hope not and with god's help or whatever caused this miracle that it stays. I would like to know how to handle this feeling. I don't think I know how to handle this feeling of feeling good. There are still many outside experiences that will cause stress while I rebuild my life. Huge part of me don't know how to rebuild it because I am in an unfamiliar place. I posted in where to help set goals to get my life together, but no one answered. I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless again. Is there a site that can help me and I can get support? There should be some kind of support for people who start to feel better and how to maintain it especially since we haven't had this feeling for a long time or ever. I really feel like this is the first time I really feel good, clear head and body.I posted here because I feel I accomplish success over my depression though not complete. Please help direct me to the right place.Thank you.
