Name Something You Do Well!Having depression often makes people think very negative thoughts about myself, how I don't think I'm good at anything, etc. I want to challenge that. Please post with at least one thing you are good at or like about yourself. You can absolutely post more than one thing! You can make multiple posts if you think of something else!And no posting you aren't good at anything, as tempting as that might be. I KNOW that everyone had good qualities about them, it's just the depression hiding it from you! I believe in you!!As for me, I think I have a lot of empathy, so I can relate to people easily even if I don't agree with them. I also like the color of my eyes, am an illustrator, can handbind a book, and make a mean batch of chocolate chip cookies.Sometimes Happiness Is A Choice.Sometimes happiness and joy can elude those of us who struggle with depression and anxiety. Sometimes it feels like happiness is completely impossible, unattainable. I know I felt like that for a long time. But when things are going wrong, when all your plans come undone, sometimes... you just need to make yourself smile. Eat a little ice cream, give someone a hug, buy a new pair of shoes, and keep smiling, even when you don't want to. (not to be confused with hiding your feelings, us depressed folk need to NOT bottle away our depression.) Because if you believe happiness is a choice... that smile can become a real genuine smile. I'm just thinking this because I definitely am not walking the easy road in life.. and a lot of my recent plans I was very excited about fell through. But instead of sulking about it forever, like I used to, I'm trying to build new memories and new adventures with what life decided to give me. And my smile, at least right now, is genuine.
