I'm New- Had a question if someone might be able to help.Hello. I haven't been diagnosed with any type of disorder, but I'm pretty sure I have plenty of Anxiety Issues, Concerns, whatever you want to call them.ÊTrying not to stretch things out, about 10 years ago I was put on Lexapro for about year, the doc took me off that and put me on Citalopram-(20MG)SO I have been on this for awhile. Everything been going good, and all of sudden I just Freaking out with uncontrollable crying. I know if doesn't make a lot of difference but I'm a dude. Just saying.The anxiety lasted for about a month, went away and then came back... I talk my Primary Care Dr. and they up my dose to 30MG. The side affects were pretty common, yucky, depressed, crying like a toddler.Well; it went away, got my energy back all was good. Just recently I have been missing my 3 Year Old Son like crazy, I can't keep me mind off him, wanting to hang out and play, just to hear his voice...ÊWhat puzzles me is that I have these Anxiety/Depression/Panic feeling in the Morning (like Bad) in then they will calm down around 2PM or 3PM.ÊJust wondering if anyone has ever had the same feelings??ÊThank you all,Dave
