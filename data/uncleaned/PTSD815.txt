Êgot a new dogHi folks, I am still here. After a long lovely summer on my own I got a sudden urge about finding a new friend. I looked around for rescued dogs at the local RSPCA places and found a lovely 2 year old collie cross. It was love at first sight, well I did have a pocketful of bikkies. I have had him just over 3 weeks. He is very very timid, and scared of lots of things. Not house trained yet, but improving.But the best thing about Timmy is that he is just plain daft, bouncing endlessly around the house, and sitting on my head when I am in bed. I have not laughed so much for ages.ÊI had to do something to help me with my PTSD. I am still waiting for an EMDR therapist, now it is 17 months on the waiting list.
