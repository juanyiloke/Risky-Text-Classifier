DVTAs a result of a DVT tests revealed high glucose levels and....I have type 2 diabetes surprise surprise. I now take gliklicides and metformin (and of course the good old stattin)After 6 months treatment for DVT with Warfarin and regular blood tests I settled into a routine and my glucose numbers reduced to a very satisfactory level.Further tests revealed I had low vitamin D levels so more tablets.My Lichen Planus returned so itchy legs. However further tests revealed not LP but Eczema put down to Varicose insufficiency so more medication and moisturizer.I know I have to suffer but it is very wearing and sleepless nights are not helping.Can anybody suggest anything that would make my life a little more bearable?
