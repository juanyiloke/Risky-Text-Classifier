New and Questions________________________________________So I was hospitalized with pneumonia in the fall, and after discharge, I still was frustratingly short of breath. Primary doc sent me for testing. Pulmonary function tests were normal, but the pulmonologist ordered a methocholine challenge, and I had an intense response to that (scared both me and the resp. therapist doing the test). Saw pulmonologist yesterday to go over results. He put me on Symbicort (4 puffs a day of the higher dosage) and handed me information about asthma. When I looked at my online visit notes, the diagnosis listed was reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Researching that a bit, that seems to be the diagnosis that goes with occupational asthma, and my job doesn't put me at any real risk of inhalation exposure. Doc also noted my history of bronchitis pretty much every winter, and feels that might have been more asthma stuff than a bronchitis. So...is there a difference between asthma and RADS? For people who take Symbicort, does it work well for you? (I had been on FloVent since the pneumonia, and had several times I needed the rescue inhaler.) What can I expect as an adult, newly diagnosed with asthma? One other thing I want to ask my doc when I see him again in a few weeks -- a followup chest x-ray that I had to make sure the pneumonia was gone (it is) noted hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragm "indicative of COPD." I've never smoked...can asthma show up on x-ray like this? Peak flow readings are consistently in the 300-350 range (I'm 48, 5'8"...should be higher) since I've been taking them, even when I feel good. Can this be anormal range, even though the charts show it to be in the yellow for me?Obviously, I'm making a list for the doc (when he asked me yesterday if I had questions, I just sort of stared...getting my head wrapped around the concept that I suddenly have asthma...). What else did you wish you knew when you were first diagnosed (esp. as an adult)?
