Should i quit?2013-06-11, 10:17 AMI got promoted to a management position couple of weeks ago in a fast paced industry. I have about 70 employees and i got more than i bargained for, its a lot to deal with all those people and satisfy the needs and wants and accommodate all of them. Its a big company i moved up pretty quick and i want to quit, but i am worried about how i am letting a lot of people down, my employees, my colleagues, and my bosses. What should i do! I been here 4 weeks and i still have not adapted to it, i am also a college student so i dont have much bills right now i save all my money.Hell is the Impossibility of reason
