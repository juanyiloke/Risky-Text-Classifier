2nd diabetic nurse visitHad my 2nd visit today with the diabetes nurse. He's really pleased with my progress, lost 5lb according to their scales (mine show 8lb loss lol) and thinks coz I'm younger than most who get it, they it was caught early & seem to be responding better to the meds & my levels are lowering that I'm gonna handle it really well. Highest it goes now is 9.9 & goes as low as 6.1! I've joined slimming world which he supports so I find despite eating more fruit it's not affecting my levels. In fact a banana only pushes it up by.6! As I'm back at work next week it's a good sign at least I can eat easy stuff (I tend to forget to eat coz I get engrossed in work lol) so a banana on hand is getter than chocolate or crisps in my mind!Told me as I'm due to increase the meds to 3 a day from Thursday that if I have stomach issues again, to lower back to 2 & see the gp for further advice. I feel better in myself. I no longer feel drained & need to lie down in the afternoon..hopefully it'll continue.
