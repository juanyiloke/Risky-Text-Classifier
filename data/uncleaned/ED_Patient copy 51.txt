please readHi, i'm 15  About 18 months ago, I was border line anorexic.. Now i'm in my recovery and have reached my personal goal.Since I began recovery, I wanted to help other people that have been through or are going through the same thing as myself or even something completely different. There is nothing where I live that allows me to do this, no support groups or anything..  This website is amazing, and I believe we should all work together. Like one big family. Share our stories, help each other out. It's rewarding, i promise  if you agree, please vote and let someone know that there are people out there who care.Thank you,Holly x
