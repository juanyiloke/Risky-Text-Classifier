Nutrition, Hair Loss, First Chemo & Silver Linings...¥	Hi,¥	I have been keeping a blog of my journey so far.... and I know from prior posts that it's helped a few people. As it's been a while - I thought I'd share it again.¥	I loved and lost my beautiful long hair. I used to drink and smoke but now I'm 110% into Nutrition and have not suffered much from the harsh effects of chemo. I've had a lot of good things come out of having Cancer too. Maybe my story can help others to get through this?¥	I am HER2 positive and have had 12 weeks of EC Chemo - now on week 5 (of 12) of Taxol and have just had my first Herceptin injection (which I will have for a year). I will have a mastectomy and all my lymph nodes removed in July followed by 3 weeks of Radiotherapy.¥	https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/¥	Remember - it's a marathon not a sprint. Stay strong - you can do it!!¥	x
