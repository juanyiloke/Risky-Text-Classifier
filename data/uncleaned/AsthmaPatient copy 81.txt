Montelukast Relief from side effects Hello allI am taking Montelukast. The only side effect was I could not sleep at allI recieved an e mail from a professor in a reply to my question of not sleepingHe said in keeping with their guidance to start by taking it at 6.00pm and then move the dose forward by 2 hours every day in order to identify the time that gives the maximum benefits with the minimum effect on sleeping.It works for me ( Hooray) The combination of the medication and sleep, I have improved beyond beliefRegards Alan
