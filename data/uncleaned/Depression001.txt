C111Don't know what to do or sayHello. My partner has suffered with bouts of depression and the last episode was 8 years ago. It was severe and he ended up.in hospital because he was drinking heavily. He isn't drinking now very often now which is good. He has become ill again and the doctor has put him on anti depressants. The problem is he gets so angry with everyone and everything and rants and shouts at me when we try and talk.about it. I just seem to make him angry. It makes me so sad and lonely. He says I don't understand but I am scared of it getting as bad as before. He was very aggressive then and said very distressing things to me. I dont think I can cope if it gets that bad again. I want to help but his anger and shouting makes me clam up and I can't help then. I avoid talking about it with him as I say the wrong thing and annoy him. I don't know what to should do to help. He thinks I don't understand.
