My depression is ruining my relationship I've struggled for depression for years and always managed to get through it. However in the past yesr my life has taken the turn for the worst. Firstly my father was diagnosed with depression & shortly after I was made redundant. This cycle continued and I have since been made redundant in the following 3 jobs I have had. I have completely given up after forcing myself to get up & carry on. All my strength and self esteem has been swapped for depression and anger. My girlfriend has gotten the brunt of it all. In a way I almost emotionally abuse her. I flip out at the smallest of things such as if she doesn't reply to a text message. I constantly end our relationship. Tell her she doesn't support me doesn't understand or care about anyone but herself. She is the most caring person I have ever been with yet I keep pushing her away and destroying our relationship. Taking out the anger I feel on the world on her. Yesterday she left to stay at a friends as I told her to leave. Now I feel nothing but an increased hate and resentment towards her for leaving knowing how low I feel although I told her to leave.I don't know what to do any more. Why am I taking this out on her? All I feel inside is pain & all I can think about is self harm (which I have started again) & ending my life.
