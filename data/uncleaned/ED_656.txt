New member body image question.I am a 35 year old male who has spent the better part of 20 years following a strict diet and vigorous, brutal exercise regiment. Over the last few years My energy levels began to decline due to work, stress and sleeping poorly.This all led to lowering the intensity level I could exercise at. To counter act this I began to lower my calories in order to not add an unwanted weight.I began to lose weight I wanted to keep (muscle).ÊI have reached the point where I know that that approach was counter productive but any time I attempt to increase my calories in order to rebuild lost muscle mass, I feel like I am over eating and will store it as fat.anyone else have any similar issues?
