Is this Asthma?Posted 15 days agoI'm not sure if any of you can help me but I am looking for some advice.  My husband has had a cough for about 4 years now.  At first he was diagnosed as having asthma, but he then went to see another doctor in the same practice who said it wasn't asthma.  He had a chest x ray, which was clear and we had a CT scan done privately which revealed scars on his lungs.  His cough persisted and just before Christmas it was so bad that he went back to the doctor.  She heard the cough and said it sounded like asthma, so he had asthma again.  He was prescribed a blue and brown puffer.  His cough continued to get worse and had now turned very phlegmy.  He was coughing constantly day and night and his peak flows went down to 250.  He went back to the doctor again (the 4th time in as many weeks) who prescribed a 7 day course of prednisolone.  This improved his cough, although it was still there.  He stopped taking the prednisolone on Tuesday and by Thursday his cough was just as bad as it had been and back to waking him at night again.  And now, Sunday, he is still coughing.  Does this sound like asthma?  It's horrible listening to him suffer, I feel so helpless.  If he has been taking his blue and brown puffer, as prescribed, shouldn't he start to feel better by now?  I am worried that it is something other than asthma.
