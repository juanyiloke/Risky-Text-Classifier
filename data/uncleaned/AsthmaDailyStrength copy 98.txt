Hi. I was recently diagnosed with asthma. We aren't sure if it's from my GERD or indoor allergies. Well, my doctor prescribed me Singulair and Asmanex. Here's where it gets complicated. I have really bad anxiety and a HUGE fear of medication. I haven't been treating my allergies,asthma,gerd, or anxiety and my asthma is getting really bad. So, basically what I want to know is, out of the Asmanex and Singulair, which works the best with least amount of side effects? I don't care about headache or nausea. I can deal with those. It's the anxiety (which you can get from corticosteroids) , stomach pain or racing heart that I can't handle. Pleae help!
