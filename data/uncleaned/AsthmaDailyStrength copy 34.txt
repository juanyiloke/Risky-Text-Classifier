I have had asthma since childhood. Usually I will have 2 major episodes where I get sick when the seasons change. Since working my current job of 4 years I have been sick all the time. I have missed so much work because the building has mold and lots of dust. I asked for a transfer a year ago and it was never granted. My doc suggested I take a few months off to let my lungs rest. I did and filed for short term disability. The claim was denied because the insurance company said I can perform the job. I can't because I cough violently and wheeze and become light headed and can barely talk. I am so depressed because I am behind on my bills. I have since gone back to work. I can count on my fingers the number of days I've actually worked due to me getting sick as soon as I enter the building. I am at the point of giving up. I am tired and don't know what to do. 

I am on the verge of giving up. I filed a complaint with EEOC against my employer. I haven't been able to work in the building where I work because there's mold in the building. Since working there the past 4 years my asthma is severe. I am on so many asthma meds now. My job states there's mold but not enough to cause health issues. I asked to be transferred a year ago, my request was never granted. Now I'm about to lose my car, apartment because I'm too sick to work. The job denied my claim for short term disability. I have tried to be strong but I can't keep it together much longer. Lawyers won't touch my case because it's a state job. Please pray for me.
