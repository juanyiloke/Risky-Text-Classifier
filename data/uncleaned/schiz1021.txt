 Need help, various questionsI am a 27 year old disabled veteran woman. I came down with schizophrenia in 2006. I am losing my memory, I have no feelings, physically, emotionally, or sexually. I currently live alone on va benefits. I find myself forgetting to lock the doors, and close the blinds when i use the redtroom, etc. I do not want to live alone anymore. However, I have heard horror stories about mentally ill people being taken advantage of. The healthcare in Texas is really poor. I have searched the internet and most other states, especially in New England, have alot more to offer for the mentally ill. I am going to try to get transportation to schizophrenics anonymous in Dallas. I don't know about community living, or shared housing, or boarding homes....does anyone have any advice? I am going to try to find a ride to NAMI in Fort Worth. At the least I could get a female roomate. I am very alone, and I don't know what to do.
