ÊProgressHello, everyone. I've not been on PC much for a couple of weeks, I hope you are all ok.I just want to let you know that I seem to have made some significant progress recently with EMDR. Three sessions ago, T said that we had got through the whole processing process with the target memory in one session, which was the first time it had happened. Following on from the stuff I mentioned a while ago, I was perceiving one part of myself comforting another. The next session we took a target memory linked with the same event as before, but my mind didn't need to stay there and came forward to something else. And yesterday I could honestly say that I thought that the event we'd been targeting was dealt with.T is going to call me in a couple of weeks just to check, then after a break I can go back for further help with other stuff, if I want to - and I think I will.So I can totally recommend EMDR to help with trauma, and for me it has been fine even though I am on regular (prescribed) morphine for pain relief. Apparently it's needed ten seconds or so extra for the tappers each time but T said the processing went fine.I'd like to thank people here on PC for their support when things were really hard. I hope that my experience brings hope and reassurance to some of you. I know I have much further to go, but I'm glad to have reached this far.Bluegrey
