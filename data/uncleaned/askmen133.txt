Reported for being late.2011-06-14, 07:04 PMI came to work yesterday 35 minutes late because of traffic. This morning I found out a co-worker sent an email to my boss yesterday (who was also off yesterday) 20 minutes after my start time wondering if I had the day off. I have no real contact with this co-worker. The fact I am there is meaningless should be meaningless to her. When my boss came this morning, she forwarded me the email and asked what was up? I replied saying I was stuck in traffic. She never commented. I usually come on time. If I am ever late, it is 5-10 minutes or so. I am salary so do not punch in. No supervisors were in the office yesterday, so I could not give anyone the heads up.WTF, What does everyone think the deal with this is?
