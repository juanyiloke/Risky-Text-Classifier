Graduate Nurse Scheme - Back Pay________________________________________Hi everyone im wondering if there are any nurses out there who have had the same problem as me.I graduated in 2013 and I worked as a fully qualified psychiatric nurse from September 2013 until August 2014. Part of that (from September to October 2013) was my pre reg.I never went for the graduate interviews during this time. And as such I was never under the scheme, I was employed by the HSE as a temporary nurse.I was paid 50% of a nurses wage during my pre reg and 80% during my time as a fully qualified nurse. This years pre reg nurses were paid 80% of a nurse wage for their pre reg time.I believe I am entitled to 100% pay for the entire year I worked for the HSE as I was never employed under the graduate scheme. My classmates who took up the graduate scheme are owed 100 % pay for the months they worked before they signed their contracts.I and others in my situation have contacted multiple unions regarding the situation. The only thing I've been told is "its a matter they are looking into" and it may require a case to be taken against the HSE. I offered to do this but the rep said it would need to be the unions that would take it. I was told that nurses nationwide were affected.I am owed a considerable amount of money as I`m sure many nurses in a similar situation to me are.I would like to connect with those nurses. Discuss this. Maybe take signatures or something like that and put pressure on the unions to follow this up with the HSE. Its my opinion that it is not a pressing matter for the unions. Perhaps as we as graduate nurses have not made it so.I Hope to hear from nurses from all fields affected. Feel free to copy and paste this post and send it on to friends.Thank youhttp://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2057361420Have to leave - is there social welfare support I can get?________________________________________I have come to the end of the line at work and its all happened very quickly.See below the **********'s if you want to skip the backgroundI work in a heavily commission / bonus based role, however over the past two months targets have been doubled and the bonus part of commission been removed. Net result is I am going to take a significant hit financially. Added to this having worked successfully on my own for over 10 years in the company and generating significant revenue and profits I now have to hand over clients that I have nurtured and serviced for years to new staff members and I will only get commission on new clients brought in and managed. These new staff members will get half of what what was my commission, I will get none, even though its my mobile that keeps ringing every time something needs changing.Now as an educated person its plain to see I am being "engineered out". They know what my commitments are and know I am screwed. Others in the office have said as much. It even appears that emails are being intercepted, as I have been contacted by phone by a client after another staff member returned mails sent for me.I've asked why they are doing this to me and been pretty much given a prepared corporate speech. The current business model is not sustainable bla bla bla. These are not your clients they are the companies clients to do with and manage as we please. All of which in varying degrees are true, I'm not that naive to think other wise.What they dont realise is what goes on behind the scenes. I am the one that sponsors my clients kids sponsored walk / swim / charity cycle etc. I am the one that has to get them tickets for what ever big game is on because "we dont want to be seen to do that", I buy the wedding present, attend the funeral do all the things that dont appear on the management accounts. Over 10 years you build relationships, I've been to a clients wedding, meet some socially their business is mine whether I work here or else where in a good number of cases. But my management just see me as a massive overhead that can be replaced by grads, which maybe true - time will tell.************************************************Rather than go work for another company I'd like to try give work ago on my own. If I resign is there any thing that I can get from social welfare to keep me ticking over, I'd be looking at a 6 month lead in before I'd get first paid.Having spoken to a friend there is an argument that I could get a constructive dismissal but my industry is too small, if things didn't work out for me long term I'd be ruined professionally. The office environment is poison, things have been said that there is no going back from and there is now a stand off, they wont make me redundant or fire me and I wont resign. I am stressed to the extent that work is impacting on my health, mental and physical. I'm not alone in what has happened another person here is in the same boat as me. Any advice gratefully accepted
