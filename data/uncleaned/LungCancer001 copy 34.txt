Upper Right Lobectomy...Hi all I have been reading this forum since my diagnosis...done a lot of smiling and a lot of crying at your stories..My story started 4 months ago with a routine X-ray followed by CT scan PET scan and biopsy....I had lung surgery 3 weeks ago Sept 10th...I feel very well, the pain has virtually gone, still feel a bit breathless at times which can be scary!!!. But hopefully will improve..My main problem is the waiting and wondering..my first appointment since surgery is not until Oct 10th..I have no idea how it went ..did they get it all? Will I need chemo? I feel like my head is going to explode I spend so much time crying and feel I want to scream...
