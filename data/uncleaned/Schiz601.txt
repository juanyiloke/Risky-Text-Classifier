ÊMy doctor is saying hospital or bye.I had an appointment with my pdoc today. It was online so I told her everything on my mind, what medicine changes I wanted to talk about and stuff. But when I told her about my shadow, she said that I needed acute care right now. But I don't get it. It's just like every other day. Just new ****. She said if I don't go, she won't be able to help me or continue prescribing because I'm being noncompliant to her wishes. She didn't force me in but she told me to email her tomorrow and tell her my decision. I wouldn't go back to my old hospital. But the new one, they have cameras viewing the entrance to every single room. That scares me but I can't drive to another city for another place.I don't want to go. I don't even know why she's forcing this on me. If I want to keep her as a doctor, I have to go. I don't want to lose her but I really don't want to go to the hospital just because there's someone new behind me.Ê
