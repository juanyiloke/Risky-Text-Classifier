ÊDeprive, Eat, Panic, RepeatI feel horrible. I'm panicking and I feel like my control of myself and my life is gone and has been gone for too long.ÊToday I had way less than usual, and at the end of the day my count was the lowest it has been yet, and I was absolutely starving. So I ate. And I told myself, it's better anyway to get those calories in. Nothing I ate was unhealthy but I'm beating myself up. I ate less than I consumed for my meal today, which makes me feel terrible about myself even though I'm still below where I should be.ÊAnd having eaten so little until about 10:30 pm today, I feel like that is the goal for tomorrow. I feel like it has to be the goal now, and that goal has been getting harder and harder to attain lately.I wish my life was my life again.
