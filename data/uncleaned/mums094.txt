DS is 9mo and does the range of normal things that would be 'bad' behaviour in a older toddler - eg banging his cup gleefully on the table, pulling my hair, taking toys off other babies, etc.Obviously I realise he is too young to understand and respond to 'no', but should I at least be using the word and trying to stop him doing the 'bad' things (taking the cup off him when he bangs it and so on)? Or at this age should I just let him have fun and ignore the idea of 'good' and 'bad' until he is older. In that case, when do you start?Part of me thinks I should start now just to train myself, even if it makes no difference to DS.
