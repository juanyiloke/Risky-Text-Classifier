I have tried to stop smoking going on probably 20 times in the last month or so and I feel so down about it. I was on day one but here I am with a pack of cigs tonight. I get up in the morning and reach for the gum and by night time I find it almost impossible to stay away from smoking. I have so much free time on my hands...can someone tell me why I fail all the time at stopping smoking? Please tell me something !!
