I need help and I don't know what to doI have never spoke to anyone about this so I am not officially diagnosed and may not even be posting this is in the right place. I have had issues around food for the last five years, I would describe them as bad habits, skipping meals and only eating a very small selection of safe foods, weighing foods and counting calories. These habits seem to change in severity from time to time. I also binge after days of being hungry. I don't eat in front of anyone except for my partner not even my step children and never go out for meals. My weight is the lowest it's ever been but my bmi only just puts me into the underweight category. I don't know if these things mean I have an eating disorder or not, either way I need some help and advice.I hate missing out on attending friends birthday meals and date nights and spending hours cooking for my family each day and never eating with them. My partner is being destroyed with worry and upset and when I've binged and feel guilty he is at the receiving end of my emotions which racks me with guilt and self loathing further.please could someone help me?
