Weight loss after chemo radiotherapy¥	Hi Ladies¥	Seems a silly moan or query but I have finished chemo 6 wks ago and radiotherapy last week, during radio it was noticed I had lost half a stone in  just over a week and still now lost a couple more pounds, I also found at the end of chemo I put weight on very quickly , its not down to eating less but I have had really bad water retention around legs and ankles, these are going down now just wondering what other Ladies have gone through with weight issues at the end of treatment.¥	Have a nice day¥	wendy d
