Can't Fake It AnymoreOne of the most striking things about my life post PTSD is how isolated I've become due to the simple fact that I can't bring myself to fake it with people anymore. I can no longer come up with fake stories about who I am, where I grew up, how I grew up, who my parents are, what they did for a living, why I dropped out of college, the list is endless. When I first got out of my parents' house, I shot out like a cannon spewing lies, lies, lies like a natural to every face I met. I could go into a bar and meet someone and when they'd look at me and say, "What's your story?" I'd make up whole fake life stories on the spot. I didn't even think about it, it just seemed like the natural thing to do. But since PTSD hit, it's like the whole facade just came crashing to rubble around me. If someone were to ask me today, "What's your story?" I don't know what I'd do. I'm just profoundly tired of living on lies. So I avoid people altogether, because I know nothing about me would be acceptable to them. I'm just too tired to lie.I wish I still had it in me sometimes. I wish I could get dressed right now and go out for a drink and meet someone and just conceal everything about myself, laugh, drink. I've always wanted to be with people who were out of my rank. Man, I was skating on thin ice. "I don't know where you get it from," my narcissist ex-boyfriend used to say. I think when I was growing up, something in me just wouldn't accept the reality around me. I escaped through fantasy. And then PTSD; it was like the roof caving in on decades of denial, like I had justrealized that all of those things had happened. The normal life people just make want to go live in a cave and never come out. I don't want to hear about it.I wish I could go back to denial sometimes. It's the only thing that ever worked. Why can't I fake it anymore?
