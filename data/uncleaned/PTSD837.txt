 EMDR or Trauma focused CBT?I have been diagnosed as suffering with complex PTSD which has been caused through a very complex long going work situation. I have been off work since May and am really struggling, the NHS have be absolutely amazing with me and beyond supportive. They have been giving me Focused based CBT since May which is weekly 90 minute sessions.I contemplated suicide and took steps to carry out the same late last year and after feeling the same thoughts and actions the doctor has put me on citalopram which hasnt kicked in yet.Work have been shocking but the occupational health side of work are actually quite good and have sent me to be diagnosed hence the complex ptsd, anxiety and depression. Anyway to get to the point they have mentioned EMDR but my counsellor says they wouldnt recommend both EMDR and CBT? Any thoughts on which is best? Also any experiences on citalopram. I desperately dont want to feel how i feel i just struggle to see any light at the end of the tunnel?thanks everyone
