lobectomyI have stage 4, I did have stage 1 til they found it in my brain and ,mediastinal area, the brain part is gone . I did 35 rounds of radiation and 2 rounds of chemo, they reduced it from 10x6mm squamous lung nodule to 6x4 mm, n but theres a new ground glass that's 10 x6 mm . I know there reasons for not doing a lobectomy, , I know its cause of stage 4 and that it could be seeding somewhere else, but if I want to take the chance , even if its a 20 % chance, why cant I have one if that's what I want, its my body , not theres, and it my life not theres. I would do it no matter what kind of pain I"d be in.please tell me why I cant make the decisions I want to make regarding this
