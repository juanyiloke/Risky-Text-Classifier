My Mother started Singulair yesterday My Mother has severe asthma. I am a nurse myself and was becoming quite sadened to see her quality of life steadily reduce as inhaled medicines were becoming less effective. She started Singulair yesterday and has reported that she had a &quot;wheeze-less&quot; night and for the first time in years can feel air reaching right into her lungs. She is also able to walk further today and has not had to use her nebuliser as much. She is pleased- I am over the moon. She will tolerate side effects as they present if the quality of her life has improved so much already. So a big &quot;thank you&quot; to asthma reasearch for creating this medicine. I hope millions of people feel better for it.
