Thinking like a guy?Been thinking about this a lot as I do my vacation and catch up with friends, most if whom are of the feminine persuasion and most of whom - even my sister - self-describe as "having a guy brain". Like it's either a badge of honor or it's just how they were raised or they think it's what guys want to hear.ÊBut in the interest of discussion what does it all mean really? All of them would hardly be described as being tomboys - maybe one, possibly two have tomboy personality traits I feel like, but you know they're still all girls they do their makeup some love to gossip some don't some hated having a wedding others loved it etc but it can't think of any distinct traits that make you have "a guys brain" except maybe saying you aren't a Victorian era Barbie doll or something. For the most part I think there is just a lot of gender-neutral conversation or thought that both guys and ladies regularly get involved with that makes ladies think "this isn't ladylike it must be a guy thing"ÊHave you experienced this? Do you know someone who describes themselves as thinking like a guy? Are you one of those people who labels yourself as having a guy brain? Do you chug a pint of stout in a sundress or do you watch my little pony while also feeling comfortable talking about "un-ladylike conversation"? Is the whole "guy brain" thing just people trying to realize there are things we talk about in both camps?
