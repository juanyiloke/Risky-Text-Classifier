Êhiding it from the ones you lovei've been dealing with eating disorders since I am about 16. i've either restricted to stay thin or purged after binge eating when i couldn't take it anymore. the thing is, i never let myself get to a point where i was so skinny because i didn't want anyone around me to notice and make me seek help...because then i wouldn't be able to do it anymore.i started a serious relationship a year and a half ago with the man of my dreams and i sort of got better (or i thought...) until about 6 weeks ago when i started restricting myself and purging and lost weight.Êi sort of feel trapped now because i am lying to the man i love and hiding the fact that i am sneaking off to purge after almost every meal.Êi am battling with myself because i am so tired of this torture i put myself through but at the same time i just don't want to admit it to anyone...on top of it all, i work in the mental health field and so i KNOW what to do...i guess i just needed to vent with a group of people who will understand what i am going through. i've kept this to myself for the last 10 years...
