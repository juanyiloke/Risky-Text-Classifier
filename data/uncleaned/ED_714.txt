Feeling Forced to lie to my ed teamThe thing is that i am on a sick leave due to my ed, but now its been so long that unless that my treatment is going the right way and i keep getting better i wont get the same amount of money as i do now. And i cant afford to get less.ÊThings been really hard (not ed related) and my hunger cues are low which makes my ed happy. I dont feel like i have the strenght to handle the negative feelings caused by eating on top of everything else, either. all in all everything is going downhill.ÊBut now i feel like i have to lie about it to my ed team so i dont loose my money. Its such a pressure. I dont know how to handle it. And what to do. Any advice?
