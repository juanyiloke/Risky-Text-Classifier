ÊDestroyed FamilyJust read an old letter from my sister. Maybe I should burn it. I had married (now divorced) against my family's wishes (I'm 58) and they disowned me and forbid me to see my mother who was in a Care home with Alzheimer's. I was devastated at the time and the pain is still acute.Marrying him was wrong and all the rumors were true. I have paid heavily for doing it. My sister said that everyone has always known that I'm a basket case and that she has helped me through many, many problems and that my whole family has always treated me as being "delicate". I have never noticed this. Am I so blind to the actions of others?ÊI don't know what to do. We are trying to have a new (and better) relationship, but it's hard. I've had to ask her to twice for money she owed me and this has caused her to drastically withdraw from me. Was I wrong to ask? I thought I was being brave, using my DBT skills and actually standing up for myself. Now I think that I should have just let it go.So much pain. I know I take OTC's and Rx's to cope. I just have to block it all out. Please help. I want things back the way they were. I want my family back. I ruined my entire life.
