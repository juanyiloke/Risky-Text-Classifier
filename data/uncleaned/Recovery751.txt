Is it Losing Hope, Or is It Depression?I've always considered myself to be in control of myself and my feelings.  I dont and never have felt like hurting myself or others, infact I'm the opposite.  I feel the need to help others before I help myself, I will go out of my way to do things - build things - help others - be there for others before I do for myself.  I begin my own projects and lose interest or findmyself just sitting and pondering over and over again how to do it to perfection. I'll do something and redo it again because its not to a high standard. Yet when I do it for someone else, I feel happier, I feel I need to get it done and I feel happier making other people happy..What takes me a day to do for someone else takes me 5 days to do for myself..???I have a government job that requires me to be employed casual and I love my job. I dont feel pressure, I go to work with a belief that I mite actually help someone.  But its the management - Bosses who make me wonder my capabilities.  Recently I left my family for several months in the hope that I can prove I'm capable of the job, I'm prepared to do what it takes and I belong, after 4 yrs of trying.  Then a person 3 months as a casual get the job instead.  I worked hard, with pride and then again its all taken away, once again.   Now I have returned home and my partner whom I love more then life itself is constantly criticised by me or I get snappy at what she has to say for no reason.  I get up wanting to do things around the house that I have startted or need to do with einthusisium and excitment and then its gone.. I can see/feel my partner slowly being pushed away from me but she is a solid rock.  My Question is this...Am I slipping into Depression or am I just giving up and how do you tell the difference?
