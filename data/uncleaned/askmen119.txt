Advice on a Summer Job for a college student2012-05-22, 07:01 PMI'm a student home from college looking for a summer job. I've been applying everywhere, sending emails, etc. I got a callback from a water park near my area for an interview. It's the best water park in the area and its summer, what else is better than working in a water park all summer.ÊMy only concern is that it's a bit of a stretch from where I live. It's 30 miles away and a 40 minute drive on the expressway. With one summer class that I'm taking on Monday through Friday from 8am to 10am I don't know if I'll be able to have a full time job. I haven't gone to the interview yet so, I do not know how much I will get paid yet (if hired), or how many hours. What should I ask/discuss with the interviewer in order to make the right decision with ease and what should I think about myself before and after my computer.
