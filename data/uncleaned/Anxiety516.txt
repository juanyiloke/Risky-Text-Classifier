Can anyone help meHi, I am 38 years old. I don't believe myself I am a stressed out person but then I do worry about stupid things. For the past 6 months my doctor is under the belief that I suffer with IBS however no medication works. I stumbled across anxiety on google and was just reading on it which has brought me here today.I seem to get strange symptoms, stomach ache, gurgling in stomach which is why I think my doc thinks I have ibs, I have even had loads of tests in hospital for this but its all clear. He has never mentioned anxiety to me, but I get chest pains like a ache it moves from right to left and back, 1hr ago it was on my right now its on my left and the right don't hurt ? I have never been ill in my life so the slightest thing that goes wrong now causes me to over worry like I am dieing or gonna have heart attack, I need constant reassurance from either the doctor or family/friends that I am ok. People tell me this is muscle pain but it cant be cos it goes from left - right through out the day. I get bloatedness and gas and I just cant stop thinking about the aches and pains and I now believe I worry myself into these states of needing reassurance . I had ECG, blood tests etc there is nothing wrong with my heart. I am going to make appointment with doctor, but does anyone who reads this think I have anxiety ?. When I am busy or laughing about with my friends all these pains go away then when I am back relaxing they all start again. Strange. I have read anxiety symptoms etc and I am surprised my doctor has not picked up that it could be this, what do you think ?
