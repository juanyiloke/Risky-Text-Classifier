im at my limitkatarinaSorry for bothering, but i feel like i should let this goMy name is katarina and im 18 years old, the thing was that when i was 9 i had this stepdad that actually raped me, and i dont mean having intercourse, he touched me where nobody cant.. he doped me, and i remember to feeling dizzy. Its a hard thing to talk about.. then the next day i telled my mom everything that i remembered and she didnt believed what i was saying. And i dont know why but i shut up, and say: yes ure right mom, im sorry, i lied.And it wasnt. And then the things got worse, this guy filmed me while i taked my showers, and touched me while i was asleep. And i shut up cause i was ashamed of me, cause i let him do that.. that year i took a gun and pointed right in front of my head, i couldnt shoot cause i didnt have an idea of how to use a gun..All these nine years that i keeped with my mum were like this. And all these years i tried to commit suicide and failed trying it, there were pills, wraist cuts,times when i almost jumped from my roof with a rope around my neck…And i know that its silly to overreact about all this but i really feel sometimes like it was my only solution..My mom its happy with him, she stil doesnt know and i cant leave my house cause i live far from any other town..My psichologist suspects all this but i cant talk in real life about this, and i feel so frustrated.. i want to leave all this in the past and i dont mind the way to do it..My sincere apologies about my bad english and to make u lose time reading this, i wanted to somebody, anybody know about me
