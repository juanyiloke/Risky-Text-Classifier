I am home again... and Happy New Year!Arrived home from a week away starting early morning 24th this evening at 7pm.  I had limited time on the internet because during the first few days we were staying with friends.  It was hectic but really enjoyable.  We've done the rounds together with our hosts, enjoying hospitality from mutual friends for lunches, afternoon teas and drinks, plus long walks.  Quite exhausting in some ways but great.  Pumpy has mostly been on 60% and I must sort it out, but I have been really naughty eating puds and choccies and surprised with the results, must sort it out.  Am I cured?Then had 2 nights shopping expedition staying in a hotel with hardly any internet and believe me - trying on clothes has been like a workout.  In one afternoon I consumed a whole tube of lucozade tabs!Anyway.....
