  Should we move for child with asthma?________________________________________Hi everyone!Our 4-year-old daughter has severe asthma. She was a 30-week gestation baby, had RSV twice and I (mom) has asthma. We have had tremendous difficulty with her asthma here in OKC. She was hospitalized at the age of 18 months old in the PICU one step away from life support and diagnosed at the age of 2. I recently started doing research on asthma and moving for her. I have found that OKC is in the 4th worst place in America to live for asthmatics. Her best season is summer and rarely has a problem. My thinking was to move somewhere temperate and warm by a coast. Upon my research, it looks like asthmatics do best in this climate. Her triggers are cedar trees, major weather changes / fronts (we have 75 degree days and then the next day it will be 35), and cigarette smoke. We have been considering moving to Savannah, GA. Anyone here live in Savannah that has asthma or a child with asthma? If so, what are your thoughts?Any input is greatly appreciated. Thank you all for your time.
