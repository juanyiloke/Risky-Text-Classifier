change of daily routinehi guys,i have been going through some big changes these past weeks. i finished my BA and moved cities, back to my home town which is nice because i missed living in this city but it also meant leaving my friends and familiar environment of 3+ years behind. i started working yesterday. i was really anxious about it but the first two days have been really okay i have to say. like everyone is pretty much my age and the atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. i felt welcome right away and even though the work itself might not be something i will do for the rest of my life it's work and that matters right now.before when i was still in school i had a lot of time for myself, i had time to plan my meals, eat at home and work out A LOT. now i don't really have that anymore. they offer free fruit and cereal all day at work so i have access to that all day. i feel like i am eating like a whale rn just because the food is always there. i don't think i eat more than before necessarily but it feels like A LOT more becuase i sit all day and am not as active anymore. my workouts are shorter and also rushed before or after work. i feel awful. i feel like i will gain TONS by next week. i am terrified. have any of you experience with this? sitting around the office all day being constantly hungry. ugh. i am so terrified of gaining weight, the anxiety is crippling :((( i have not been able to lose more weight for a while now. i don't know if that's because i am at the edge of being underweight... it's just so ... i'm panicking :((( everything is scary
