LIBYAKeep British troops/forces out we are already overstretched and we will not get any thanks for meddling. Civil wars are for the combatants within their countries boundaries it is often said 'better the devil you know' I'm thinking what happened in the former Yugoslavia after Tito departed. A nation fell apart. What will happen after Gaddiffi? = Ayatollah Hole in the Head? or worse. It is time for Britain to mind our own business. I'm sure that there are millions of pensioners who will know of better ways of spending taxes! I would say that wouldn't I, I supported Chamberlains efforts
