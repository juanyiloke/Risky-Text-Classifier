Please read- we need your help immediatelyHI Everyone,I need your help. I am a 44-year male. I have never smoked a day in my life and recently have been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. It has metastasized to my skull, brain and femur. What I am looking forI am looking for individuals, whether it be physicians or patients who have seen similar conditions and to provide information on their treatment/treatment protocol. If it was not the standard treatment protocol – that’s perfect. Below is all the information from the different scans, biopsies etc.One key thing to note is the marker for this mutation…it is the EGFR marker.Please help.Thank you so much in advance and god bless.March 31, 2014
