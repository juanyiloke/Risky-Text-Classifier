Seeking advice for a worried mindHello, For a few months now I have been experiencing symptoms of diabetes. It all started a month into my first year of university before a bio mid term. I went back and forth to the doctors trying to get a hold of what I was experiencing. During those months I did a urine test which came out negative for sugar and so my doctor told me to go to physiotherapy for pelvic floor issues. However, I was drowining in my worry so I went back and demanded a HbA1C test. According to my doctor my result was normal (me being in the state of euphoric ended up not asking what the number actually was).  Fast forward a few months I am still experiencing the same symptoms. Do you think the doctors were wrong in saying I wasn't a diabetic or pre-diabetic? Should I go back and voice this to my doctor? ( I quit physiotherapy after two sessions because I felt like it wouldn't really help me). This is taking over my life and I feel like I will lose weight again like I did a few months ago (went from 118-120 to 113 but gained it all back when I started to calm down). I am a 19 year old girl, 118-120 pounds, 5 foot 1 inch, no history of diabetes on both sides of family, waist is 28 inches, trying my best to excercise daily and trying my best to incorporate fruits and veggies considering I am very picky eater.
