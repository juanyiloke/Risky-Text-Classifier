A Question regarding Job Bridge________________________________________Hi folk,Hope someone can help me with this question. I'm due to complete a job bridge term of 9months next week which is for 238Û a week. I also get an extra Û100 from my employer so I'm making 388Û no tax etc. They want to keep me on for another 9month term but under a different company name (the employer/s has 3 different entities. I'll continue getting my 238 and 150Û extra a week but is it possible for the employer to do so or can doing such have an impact on me if caught.Regards,JB
