Typing instead of handwriting exams due to RSIby FreesiasHi everyone! So over the last couple of months I've been diagnosed with RSI (repetitive strain injury) and both handwriting and typing are quite painful. However, when using an ergonomic keyboard I find the pain significantly lessens. I've been given a doctor's note that recommends I type rather than write my exams, and my uni exam office have said that they can accommodate me (although if I'll be typing or using some other software I'm not sure..). I was just wondering if anyone had experience of typing exams or using software with RSI at it's my final year and I really don't want to be thrown off balance because of this.tldr - I have RSI with exams coming up- has anyone used special software for this in exams?
