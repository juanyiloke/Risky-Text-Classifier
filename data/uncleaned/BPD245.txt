ÊBPD but so many signs of autism..?Hey everyone,So I was hospitalized a couple years back and they came to the final conclusion that I have BPD. Before that I was down as bipolar, ADHD, depression, and just generalized anxiety. (Mainly social anxiety.)Anyways what made me to come to the conclusion that maybe I'm autistic is because I've always struggled with simple task. I can put a whole computer together with no problem but it literally takes me about 5 tries to tie my shoe correctly. Why I always prefer to just wear slip ons or boots you just zip up. It's like almost embarrassing. I even had someone point out how smart I seemed when I talked. But I've always been like that, I always could carry on a smart conversation even at a young age.But my emotional intelligence is non existent. I can't control when I'm upset, mad or happy. My emotions are just all over the place and sometimes in crowded places I'm just dumb. Like I lose my voice and I stutter all over the place, like bad. I always thought that maybe is was because of my social anxiety. When everyone's looking and I'm on spot I just practically forget how to breathe. But I struggle alone. It's pretty frustrating. Oh and I also find myself constantly rocking or swaying. Mostly when I play music but sometimes in dead silence. I've been known to do it front of people without even noticing. Anyone do that?Anyways I've hit one of my highs today and I've been all over the place. I just don't like the overwhelming thoughts I can't contain..
