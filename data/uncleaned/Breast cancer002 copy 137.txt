Double Mastectomy¥	Hello.  I finished my last chemo 4 weeks ago and now preparing myself for surgery.  I am having a double mastectomy in a couple of weeks so I would really like to hear from anyone please who has also had a double and can give me an idea of what to expect, recovery, tips, advise, what to take to hospital, what to have ready at home for after.  Anything to help me prepare for what's to come please.¥	I am feeling really nervous about it.  Like many of us, I've never had any major surgery so it's all the unknown.  ¥	Thank you everyone xx
