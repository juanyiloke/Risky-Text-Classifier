I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old and am 20 weeks pregnant.I am a stay at home mum but I also work from home for my husbands company which is all internet based and takes up about 4 hours a week but I feel it is always hanging over my head as another of my jobs/roles to play.I pay all the bills, organise all activities, do all the cleaning, bed changing, cooking, shopping, dog walking, vets , medications etc. most household decisions are mine, all discipline is mine to decide, ...pretty muchly anything that is not to do with being the main breadwinner is my role.I am feeling very hemmed in, i have no option but to do all these jobs and be there fore everyone 24/7.My husband does do school drop off in the mornings and is home by about 6.30 most nights but plays 2nd fiddle to me always.He has never taken the kids anywhere by himself.Even if i wanted to go out to work scant as i couldn't put the kids in full time care/after school clubs etc.I have no interests outside the kids and house and i am now at a point where i feel i am going crazy.It could of course be the pregnancy hormones pushing me over the edge but before i got pregnant i only had a year left and then i could go be me and do something for myself as then my little one would be off to school....now it will be another 5 years as the new baby will need looking after.I am at the end of my tether and feel i have no options....
