Bringing me to the edgeGoing through the roughest time in my life so far and I am glad to have found this site a few days ago. This site brings me to the edge where I dare to look my problems in the eye and face them which is a good thing. I am going to see a therapist soon for first time in my life, I have learned a lot about myself in the last week too.Depression can teach you a lot about ones self I think and now that I am facing my problems I hope to look back on depression with appreciation one day for the lessons it taught me about myself and lessons of compassion for others. Thanks SF.
