Arguments as Violenceby Ellimist » Fri Feb 28, 2014 3:20 amThis is a thing I've been thinking about a lot recently, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way. Do you all feel or react to arguments, yelling, sometimes even just swear words, as a form of violence? Not even if it's just directed at you - if it's happening at all.For me, there isn't much (or any) differentiation between these things. Physically I react to yelling as if a person has just struck someone. Arguments generally send me into fight-or-flight mode - they're a communication of fight (or, if someone else is arguing and I'm not involved, flight). The one I can't really explain is swear words, which also often evoke this reaction. I can only say that swears are often associated with or used in violent verbal or even physical contexts; so maybe some situation happened and I've connected the two. Does anyone else react like this??
