ÊbreakthroughAfter almost 15 months of EMDR to deal with the second of my four traumas, I had a major breakthrough today. Ended up completing letting go and sobbing with my psychotherapist. At the beginning of today's session when she asked me to recall a particular image, I could feel this awful pressure in my stomach and chest, but having then processed the trauma, she asked me again at the end where I could feel the trauma in my body and those physical effects had gone. Tired beyond belief but feeling more free. Still two traumas to work through so a way to go. Feels surreal x
