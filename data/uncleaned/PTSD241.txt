PTSD vs Borderline?by itgetsreal » Sun Oct 19, 2014 7:37 pmA little history. I've been diagnosed with mental illness since 11. I'm female, 23.I don't feel like I've ever real had enough in -depth assessment to pinpoint what's wrong with me and been given several diagnoses.It's been suggested I have borderline features.***Trigger warning (brief mentions of types of abuse)***Anyway, I have a history of witness abusing at a young age, was abused as a child, sexually abused, as an adolescent, been raped, domestically abused, beaten, kidnapped.***End Trigger Warning***I've been a drug user of various drugs since 15. My symptoms that really affect my life are being over-reactive when I'm hurt and not being able to control my emotions, I am somewhat codependent. I was told that PTSD can have borderline traits. I have a lot of anxiety but I also have a lot of light stressors and chaos. I'm currently on Celexa and it helps my depression, but I also feel like it over stimulates me. I don't believe I'm bipolar, possibly bipolar ii but the most I ever get is hypomanic as slightly irritable but that could be because I'm a regular potsmoker. My most preferred drugs were benzodiazepines because they relieve they need in meed to worry about everything or over analyze. I feel disassociated with life and feel like some of my mental illness could be a result of drug use. I've done just about everything. I just hate the feeling of anxiety, it bothers my heart, physically and I get stomach aches. I hate being a rush to go nowhere.
