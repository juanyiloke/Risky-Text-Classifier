Not dealing well with neighbors or boyfriendby zebrafish » Thu Nov 13, 2014 9:07 amI've been living in this place for 2 years, and have had a lot of problems with really awfulneighbors. It's mostly been noise, but there's also been harassment and vandalism.I feel I'm getting to the point where the noise is going to make me lose it. I felt enraged tonight over one short incident of loud talking outside myapartment. And now I can't sleep.My s/o and I both have health problems, and his health problems are making mefeel like I'm being used up, taking care of him, and not being able to take care of me. He had a stroke 2 years ago, and has done great mostly, but his blood pressure medsare holding him back from being able to function. he was forced to "retire" because of this, and now is having a hard time getting freelance work because of it. Right now, it's mostly the beta-blocker he's on, which is causing him to have mental dullness.And I'm not able to support myself right now. So I have to focus on getting himable to function. But I have anger over this too - he sits back and lets me do all the health research.If I didn't do it, he wouldn't either. It makes me swear to myself that I will never ever put that on somebody else.I managed to get him off of several drugs, due to my health efforts, and he feels much better, but is still not completely there. Sometimes I feel like bolting. I can't be the strong one all the time. I had to do that when he had the stroke, but he's much better now.He's even driving a Chevy surburban around. But we are not doing well financially. If I bolted, I'd probably end up homeless. The stress is incredible.
