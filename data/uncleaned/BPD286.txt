Ênew here and looking to talkHi everybody, Im just a newbie to this forum and am still trying to figure stuff out.Ive recently been diagnosed with BPD and its making total sense of my entire life. Ive been reading Sometimes I Act Crazy, and feel like it was written for me. Does anyone have any good suggestions on other resources?I also seem to have a hard time making friends and this leads to times where I feel like I have no one to talk to so Im looking to see if anyone can relate and talk about some resolutions to almost every symptom I have under the borderline definition.Thanks in advance,Amanda
