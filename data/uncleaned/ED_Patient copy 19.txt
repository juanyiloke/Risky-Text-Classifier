Newbee!I have recently been diagnosed with anorexia, I feel very depressed and I don't have any form of motivation. I feel I get irritated very easy and I feel I am distant with my friends and family, I often cry and I am really hating myself at the moment. I am not the skeleton anorexics are often viewed as so I feel stupid telling people that the hippo that I am could possibly be classed as such thing. I have recently turned to laxatives and I love the fast results, not so much the stomach pain. I feel I will never be satisfied and I often get suicidal thoughts. I am not even bothered if I get cured or not I just want my family to stop worrying- certainly my mom who I was once very close to.
