My fitness palHi guys Many of you probably know or have heard about this app called my fitness pal. In my previous thread I said I'm a newly diagnosed diabetic (probably why I'm so happy about this app  ) . Getting to know how much carbs stuff has in it is brilliant for me, you can scan the barcode on foods from asda and tescos to lidl. It also lets you document what you've eaten ( especially if your recently diagnosed and waiting to see the dietitian like myself) it's free in the App Store. So if you haven't already check it out and hopefully it's as helpful for you as it is for me
