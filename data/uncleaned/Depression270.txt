 stressed, 4 assignments due in, dyslexic and possible adhd  Pffft, 2  Well its has been a while siince i last posted on here. I am currently going through a hard time at uni. I have 4 assignmetns (was 5 but that was done for yesterday and handed in). one is for the 24, another the 28th another the 1st and then the 11th. I am finding it really hard. I am dyslexic which makes things worse and i am getting assessed for ADHD. (haven't got my appointment yet) tbh i am so stressed and worried i feel like self harming. I am having a really hard time tbh. i don't want to sound negative but i feel like i am losing these deadline battles. its like its only a matter of time before i fail to meet them. I feel like self harming so much that its actually making me more tense
