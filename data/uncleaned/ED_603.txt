so this happened...i was at the movie theater, and i had left the theater to go to the bathroom and as i was walking down the hall i saw a family that couldn't get into the movie because there were too many tickets and not enough seats, i heard the manager say he would make sure they were first in line for the next showing, and as i was passing them to go into the theater showing the movie they wanted to see, the mother said "see? these fat effers..."i can't even talk about how it makes me feel, i'm so triggered.
