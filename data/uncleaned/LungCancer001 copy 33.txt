Just Beginnng My JourneyAny forum whose moderator is named Irish can't be all bad!I am 72, relatively healthy and active. Three days ago, after battling pneumonia for five weeks, I was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. Further testing next week will determine which stage I'm in.I've led a great life, have a loving and devoted wife for 39 years and my Bucket List is empty. No real regrets. I've been lucky and blessed.Since the diagnosis, several friends who had had and recovered from various cancers have offered me suggestions and support. I'm willing to try almost anything aside from - in addition to - the conventional treatment. I've been recommended to use flaxseed oil, ubiquinol, dried and powdered black raspberry (expensive!!!!) among other things. I'd be interested in knowing what others might suggest.Planning ahead, if I'm in stage one I'll go ahead and have surgery and lead the rest of my life. If stage three or four, I'll arrange to be kept comfortable until I die. At this point chemo and radiation are not options because for me quality of life is more important that continuing life with the quality.The shock of the diagnosis is over and planning has begun. I'm certainly unafraid of even the worst prognosis so I'm lucky there. But, again, if anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears.
