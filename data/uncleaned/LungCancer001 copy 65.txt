Post lung cancer treatment/conditionsI am a new member. Diagnosed with stage IIIB/early IV NSCLC about 15 months ago. A long story short, I had genetic testing on the tumor and was quickly started on a combo of Abraxane & Carboplatin. I had nearly 30 infusions and was eventually put in the surgery-capable category. Had RT lung lobectomy October 2013. My last PET scan was clear.My questions/comments regard what has happened since that time. I still have chest pain and I can't begin to explain some the other happenings, sleep disturbances, periods of frustration due to inability to recall basic things and other odd feelings. Mind you, I am so very thankful that I have made it thus far. I just can't see to get straight answers about "chemo brain" and other things I have happening to me which may be related to the chemo and surgery. I would welcome any comments.
