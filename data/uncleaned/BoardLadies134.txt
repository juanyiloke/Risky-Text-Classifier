Perception of women with Children..I'm afraid to write this anywhere else!! so testing the waters here...I've decided to end my 7 year relationship with my partner, we have 1 child together hes 3. I had a son when I met him so as I now had 2 children from two different men.My eldest son is 11. Both long term relationships however how will people percieve me?ÊWill they feel sorry me?Run a mile!!?Think hey I'm in here...!I always wanted a big family so deciding on this split has been very difficult but its a long time coming, I will not go on to have a third child with someone else, so my baby making days are over, which is very sad for me..ÊIs there many people out there in the 30's who don't want children but would sette with someone who has children?I don't plan or want to meet anyone any time soon, suppose I'm just thinking about everything, obviously my priority is my boys now but just thinking you know what will the future hold for me
