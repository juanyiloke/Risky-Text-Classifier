MenopauseHi, first time poster on this thread.I have searched through Boards regarding menopause and the most resent post that I can find is from 2013. I am not interested in HRT/homoeopathic remedies but would like to discuss issues (emotional/physical/mental) with other like minded women.Am I missing something or looking in the wrong section.I would have assumed that since we women will all go through this change that there would be more active discussion on this site. Apparently not I come from a farming background and I am an active participant in the F&F forum where we discuss a lot of issues openly.
