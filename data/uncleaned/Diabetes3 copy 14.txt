Dry and peeling lipsI went to the doctor yesterday to see if they could prescribe something for my ridiculously sore pout, I don't normally get dry lips but for a few weeks I've had really dry lips, so dry they're cracking and bleeding. He said it's an autoimmune thing, related to photo sensitivity. My blood sugar isn't high or anything, no dry mouth, I don't wear lipstick, lip balm or put anything on my lips so I'm accepting this odd diagnosis for now and complying with putting SPF on the pout but sounds weird to me, although it did start when the weather turned brighter I suppose  . Has anyone else had an issue with photosensitive lips?
