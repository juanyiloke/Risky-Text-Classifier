ÊI am scaredHi everyone,I am scared. I am curled up in a ball wearing diapers to self soothe and hugging a pillow and crying. This just doesn't get easier for me. Who resorts to wearing diapers to self soothe? I am a grown adult male who feels like a child and in all honesty - is a child. I just don't get how people function. I have gaps of common knowledge and life experiences and it sets me years apart from my age group...I don't feel safe anywhere doing anything. I don't trust my DBT team... I don't trust my family or friends... Everyone is out for themselves and I am better off avoiding everyone...I am alone and I suddenly realize it...ÊI am scared.
