I need someone to talk to 22 Male, I am having lots of troubles like being anxious most of the time and scared, I get depressed when I stop trying to help myself which fails everytime, I have problems breathing and shortness of breath, I live a hard life but I am a normal person kind of special to my close ones, I am good looking, I am a bit funny, educated, smart, and a bit active (working out 2 days in a week) and I have an amazing girlfriend who I have been with for a year and a half.. but I just can't seem to feel happy, I barely feel happy I can barely do something without thinking about the consequences and this makes me really serious and boring and it made me lose interest in myself, people still love me and understand me but I just can't accept myself this way because I have lot of things to be happy about but it's like someone removed the happy chemicals in my brains. I have had insomnia for the last 6 ,months and I don't like medicines that make me over-sleep because I can't afford wasting time, I have to make a living
