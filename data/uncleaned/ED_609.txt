Binge UncertaintiesSorry to double post. I'm aware there's a recovery post of mine from not so long ago.I'm still binge free (I think I'm pushing eight weeks now?) which is good.I got binge free by basically listening to my body: implementing a vague meal plan but also snacking if I fancy it/if I'm hungry.ÊThe thing is, I'm getting a lot of anxiety around snacking now and I think any snacks outside of breakfast, lunch and dinner (which are largely the same thing every day) is a binge and I've failed and I'm going to stay fat forever and blah blah.For instance, tonight I went to the gym and got home, started packing a bag (I'm going away soon), and then saw some crisps and had a few, and then a tiny other thing too. My heart knows it's nothing excessive, but my head is screaming that the binging is coming back.Is it excessive to snack a bit long after you've had dinner? Or is that normal? Is it excessive to eat a little between breakfast at 7am and lunch at 1pm? I literally do not know anymore. Also, what constitutes "a little bit"?I really want professional help with my food things but idk how because it's not that serious, but it's such a hindrance to my life and is a cause of self harm etc.
