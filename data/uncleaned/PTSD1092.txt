When I was younger I use to have these horrid nightmares. After awhile I ended up just calling them "episodes". I'll finally get to sleep and then all of a sudden it's like i'm awake, but yet still half asleep. I can hear everything going on around me, And sometimes I hear worse things. But I CANT MOVE. It's like i'm paralyzed and the more I try to fight it the worse it gets. Its so horrible, half awake half asleep or whatever it is. Can't move a single muscle in my body, It's hard to breath, I cant speak, or see, Only hear. And sometimes what I hear are things that I know are not there. Voices, Noises. Usually they're just whispers, But sometimes they're horrific, Demonic sounding, Evil. I had these episodes horribly as a child, As years went by they became few n far between but never went away. Over the past year they have been worse than EVER. Tonight I had 5 episodes in a row till the last time I was able to "wake" myself Up I Forced myself out of bed. I dont know how to label this. PTSD? SKITS? I don't know. Some of my friends think it's "spirits". Most think it's just trauma. But not every time it happens am i in a "mood".
