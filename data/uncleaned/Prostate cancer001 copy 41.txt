Robotic prostatectomy or Radiation Trearment?What a great site, thank you. I have asked to see my consultant again and have an appointment on Tuesday this week ..... when he told me I had localised prostate cancer about 8 weeks ago, although relived that the any cancer hadn't spread, I didn't really take in anything else he said afterwards.I am approaching 59, but apparently because my Gleason is 3+4 and my PSA at the time was 13.8 (recent check shows 11.8) and despite being told the cancer was detected by biopsy (nothing felt re. DRE) in 20% of samples on one side only of my prostate I have been strongly 'encouraged' by my consultant to have robotic prostatectomy rather than radiation treatment. The hospital concerned specialises in robotic prostatectomy so, perhaps, the recommendation is not surprising! Being the inquisitive type I have searched the internet for some sort of recent comparison between robotic prostatectomy and radiation treatment and am really struggling to find anything that makes me feel one is better than the other. It seems to me that most guidance is out of date before it is written!Can anyone please point me to a decent recent comparison ......... re. short and long term side affects of both techniques after treatment? ATM I feel fine, 'healthy' and in good spirits ..... but I know that after I have any treatment I will not feel so good and will experience some pretty nasty challenges for a period of time, the length of nobody seems to be able to forecast. That's the worst thing in my mind about being diagnosed with cancer, you can feel good and healthy before you are told ..... and then you become aware that treatment is going to make you feel pretty rough!Any help please re. the best way forward would be so much appreciated. devon lad
