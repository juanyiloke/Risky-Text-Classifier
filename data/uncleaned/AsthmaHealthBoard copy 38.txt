newbie to Asthma - can't sneeze?________________________________________Hi all,I was diagnosed with Asthma a week ago via an emergency room visit at my local hospital. My chest felt like it was full of cottom right on up to my throat. It was a bad episode! Could barely breathe. But they put me on oxygen and a nebulizer, did xrays and blood tests which resulted in them telling me I have Asthma. I was in shock!! Asthma?? Anyway, I felt a little bit better when I left. Let me explain that I am 73 years old and only"now" I have develop asthma?? I don't get it. Why didn't my doctor tell me this before now? I say this because over the years I have been in the emergency room for this very problem several times and even saw my doctor a few times for the same thing telling everybody who asked that I had difficulty breathing but no chest pain. The results is I wound up with four stents! So why now am I being told that I have asthma? What? It didn't show up before?? I don't understand this.My doctor has me on Venytolin (4x's a day) and Fluteicasone Nasal spray (twice a day). I just finished the Prednesone and Lavaquin meds also prescribed by my doctor. I still get the shortness of breath, sometimes very light sometimes a little stronger but does seem to pass. Now I see I deveopled another problem - I can't sneeze!! Sounds funny but it bothers me. When I feel like I need to sneeze naturally the next part to that is that you have to draw in a big breath just before you sneeze...well I am unable to do that; I can draw in about 3/4 of the breath but that is it, then the sneeze doesn't happen. This is scary to me. Is this serious? Has anyone else experienced this inability to sneeze besides me? I appreciate any input on this you can give me as I am completely new to this asthma thing and it is scaring the dickens out of me. Also will this lead to emphyzema? Sorry for all the questions! But I am a bit nervous about this.Thank you,chek
