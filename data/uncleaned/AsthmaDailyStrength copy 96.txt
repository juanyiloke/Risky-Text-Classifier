Hello, I don't really know what is going on, but it seems I'm having short-time (1 to 5 seconds) asthma attacks: I cannot breath, upper chest feels tight, and then it goes away and I can breathe. Is anyone familiar with this kind of symptoms? Until not so long ago, my asthma was under control by using Advair, Singulair and yoga. Then the insurance messed up, left me without medication for a week and meanwhile I managed to bruise a rib with a buggy-board, so no yoga for 4 weeks. Now that I have my medication back and I'm (slowly) starting back to yoga, I'm having those short "can't breathe!" Episodes. As they are so short in duration and then I'm OK, I don't take Albuterol as I get nasty side-effects and takes minutes to take effect. Any similar experiences? Any advice? Thank you in advance.
