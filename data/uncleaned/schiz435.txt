ÊWould increasing my Seroquel XR dosage from 300mg to 400mg help my brain fog?I have problems with anxiety, and previously one episode of psychosis, for which I am taking 300mg each night of Seroquel XR. I still get anxiety (sometimes quite bad), fixated thoughts (far too many of them), and a little paranoia. I am also suffering from severe brain fog (difficulty concentrating and thinking), which carries through to sort of late afternoon each day, then gets better.I spoke to my doctor, asking for an increase to 400mg in the hope that it would help me fixated thoughts and also reduce this tiredness brain fog/difficulty thinking. Am I correct in that increasing the dosage would bizarrely actually decrease this brain fog effect?I keep reading contradictory information across the internet. My doctor thought an increase to 400mg, would actually make things with my brain fog worse, but is he actually wrong?Many thanks for any help.
