I'm a 32 year old unhappy loserby Y04MF » Tue May 26, 2015 9:37 pmHello everyone. I'm not doing so well. I always have to deal with my dad's things and on Sunday he called me to tell me that he hadn't been taking his meds (blood pressure and maintenance) for two days because he had ran out of them. I got very angry and anxious when I found out the refills had expired so I started yelling at my mom (I live with her) because I think everything that's wrong with me it's because of them. And they're not satisfied for having screwed me over during my childhood (dad was an MD with prescription drug addiction (he's recovered now)and my mom was always yelling and angry and with a notable preference towards my oldest sister). They still want to keep me down. So I threw my purse on the floor and slammed some doors. My mom left and went to my aunt's house and hasn't picked up any of my calls nor answered my texts. My dad went to the ER yesterday because he wasn't feeling well but at least got his meds (or that's what he said). I haven't gotten out of bed since Sunday and I haven't been to work because I work with my mom and who knows what she said there. Plus, she's my boss and I'm just miserable there. Well, more miserable because I'm miserable anywhere. So I think I no longer have a job. Again. And I have all my family against me. I just want to sleep and not think about how unhappy and the loser I am.
