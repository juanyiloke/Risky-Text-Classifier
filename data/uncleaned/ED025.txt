10 DaysI've been struggling consistently with Bulimia for over three years, and also had an episode of the disorder ten years ago. For the first time I truly feel like I am beginning to recover, not just controlling the symptoms but actually dealing with the underlying causes. I'm not sure why I felt the need to post but I wanted to put it out there in the world that I am on day ten and I plan to, want to, and will make it to day eleven. It may not be much, but it's something.
