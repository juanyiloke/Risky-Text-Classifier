Next Treatment This is my first post on this new site, so not sure if it's in the right place or not, just tried to update my profile but that doesn't seem to have worked.Short history of my PCa - Diagnosed Oct 2010 PSA 8.9 (age 58) , radical prostatectomy Nov 2010 - post Op PSA 0.26, RT March - April 2011 (no Hormone treatment), no treatment, no medication and generally fit, PSA drops to 0.15 July2011, but has increased since then to todays PSA 2.8 (this might seem low to lots of you but remember I have no prostate to produce the PSA)Anyway I've just returned from seeing my Onco, following increased PSA to 2.8 (doubled since Feb 2014) Bone scan and CT scan shows no metastases which is great, although CT scan showed "multiple cysts within the liver" should I be worried about this? - I am. So next appointment is in 2 months time and the likelihood is that I'll have to start HT treatment soon, the Onco hasn't said which type yet so I'm a bit nervous about the potential side effects. I'm still generally fit doing plenty of longish walks (18 miles) regularly and a bit of cycling / exercise cycling, press-ups, sit ups etc. So I'm worried that HT treatment will have an adverse effect on my quality of life, with the potential weight increase and bone brittleness.Any thoughts / comments from anyone who's got the T shirt - been there, done that???Cheers for now Ecky
