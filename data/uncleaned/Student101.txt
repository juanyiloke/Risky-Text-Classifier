Not enjoying course- need adviceby northernlassI first applied to do adult nursing last year but ended up changing my mind and I'm now a first year doing English with sociology. I haven't really been enjoying the course so far and I'm worried because I'm now not motivated to do well in it. I have no idea what I will do with the degree afterwards either. I'm now worried that I made a mistake in changing from nursing. I know they are completely different subject areas but I've always enjoyed biology and English haha I changed my mind to begin with because of a bad work experience at my local hospital causing me to doubt whether I would being a nurse...I would really appreciate any advice!
