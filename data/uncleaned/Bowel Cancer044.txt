Coping mechanismsHi all,I'm new to posting but have been reading the very helpful forum for some time. I have been thinking about coping mechanisms after reading a few particular posts.People say to me they don't know how I've coped since my diagnosis and all that came with it, they think I am amazing (?), they would never be able to manage like I do etc etc.What I have done since my diagnosis is treat the cancer as a part of my life, but not THE part of my life. I have chosen not to tell many people and have tried as best I can to be "normal". Of course, deep down, I don't feel "normal" nor do I feel I am coping at all! However, because many people do not know, I do not get asked "how are you?" "when is your next test?" "what's the results?" I have support from the people that do know, but they are aware that I don't want the cancer to enter every conversation.From things I have read, it could be suggested that my mechanism for coping is not healthy, that I am "not facing" up to what has happened. I disagree. I absolutely know what has happened but I have made the decision to make it as small a part of my overall life as possible. This means I can be me, not me with cancer. That means so much-does this make sense?Interested to hear other people's coping mechanisms?with best wishes,Pippa
