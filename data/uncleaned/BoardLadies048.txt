Running on your pill...I was getting married at the end of last year so I did a run on on my pill.. not taking a break and doing 2 packs back to back, did it the month of the wedding & then again for the honeymoon... all grand. Went back to having my period normal.ÊOver Christmas I did another run on but this time, I feel just drained & I've had break-through bleeding for the last 10 days & I'm not even due my period until this weekend. Feeling crappy & moody & generally just lacking in energy... I know with the wedding/christmas it has been busy & I'm probably run down anyway but I feel this spot bleeding isnt helping the situation.ÊAnyone else experienced this before??
