ÊAm I supposed to be OK now?Haven't been around for a while, just eating/drinking/shitting/etc that most people would concede is a form of living.I seem to have had all the help I am going to get off the NHS. Is that it then? Am I cured?I seem to have been just set adrift, still on A/Ds, still see my boyfriend die. No-one has really explained to me how to stop dissociating whenever I am stressed.ÊThey did tell me that when I was being tortured all those years ago into believing my mate had died, that it was something that was bound to happen given the circumstances,Êwhat the fuck do I do now? continue until death I suppose. naturally or otherwise. I can now understand why people try to kill themselves just to get attention off someone.
