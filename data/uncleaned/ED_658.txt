Slip-ups and self loathingAargh. I hate myself. I binged yesterday after overeating compulsively on Saturday and I've gained back the weight I lost in two weeks and I'm SO mad at myself. I know it's partly bloating. But still. Dammit!ÊAnd I know I shouldn't care so much about the weight but it makes me feel like I'm on track and now is just a big visible reminder that I've slipped. And it's so unfair that two days can ruin two weeks' hard work.ÊI'm in a very bad mood. Cranky, self defeatist, spiralling into negative thoughts about all the dumb things I've ever done and how I'm bound to spend my life. Rawr. I hate this. I'm so sick of it.
