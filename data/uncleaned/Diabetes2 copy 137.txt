Help with Reactive HypoglycaemiaHello,I was diagnosed with reactive hypoglycaemia by my endocrinologist last week. I'm a 26 yr old woman and also suffer from polycystic ovaries.My sugar levels tend to be within the 4 range and I often get shakes and trembles.Quiet recently I had over 10 seizures in one night as I had a "very" sugary cake.It made me feel really sick at the time - I'm told I was pale and literally passed out. I think I had a sugar crash. I found it difficult to speak for atleast a couple of hours after the seizures too.Has this happened to anyone else? What's the best way to treat reactive hypoglycaemia?I'm eating healthy foods; fruit and veg, no fizzy drinks, mainly water and juice from time to time along with whole grain foods and complex carbohydrates. I check my sugar levels with the pen probably twice a week.Your help would be much appreciated.Jx
