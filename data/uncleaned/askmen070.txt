How to ask for a letter of reccomendation?2013-03-20, 07:27 PMI'm currently in college and applying for scholarships. I may also put this recommendation on a personal website too.ÊHow should I go about asking for a letter of recommendation from a professor? Would an email be sufficient or should I visit them in person? I was going to ask for one from my English professor I had last semester. I got an A in the class, participated, yadda yadda yadda. I do not have him this semester and I am unsure when he has office hours.ÊShould I also include that this will be posted on a personal website?Sorry if this sounds immature or anything, lol, first time ever having to ask for one of these. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
