Loneliness¥	Hello to anyone out there. I havent posted anything on here for a while. I would really like to write a blog but not sure how to do it and to get started so I thought this was probably a good place to start.  At least I can get a few thoughts down. ¥	I am almost through my chemo treatment, had no.5 last week and have got one more to go on 26 May. I'm not going to lie it has been tough. For me I'm finding one of the hardest things is to cope with the loneliness of it all.  Chemo brain is a challenge, I'm thinking in a totally different way to how I used to.  My confidence isnt the same, I have a constant feeling of being unsure about everything.¥	People say you have to think positive, keep busy, but it is really difficult when you feel so unwell.¥	Apologies if this post is rambling on a bit.  I just wanted to put something on today and make some sort of contact.
