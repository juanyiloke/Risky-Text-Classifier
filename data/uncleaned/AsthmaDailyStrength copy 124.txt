For so many years, I have just blown this off as "anxiety," as everyone always contributes anything I feel to anxiety. However...I don't have to be anxious..to have this happen (but it makes me anxious). After my period, sometimes, I have a hard time breathing. My chest is tight. I have to try to catch my breath. I am calling this "hormone induced asthma." I also suffer from panic attacks (but this is not a panic attack..this feeling comes before I get panicky). I have suffered for so long with so much...and the docs just look at me like I am a hypochondriac. But this not anxiety. I write to you today, because, my period is over..and I am feeling this. Most people get PMS before their period..I get those feelings after my period...as my hormones are not balanced..very low. I guess I am perimenopausal at this point. Please tell me that what I am experiencing is something that I can bring up to my doctor. How does this get checked? Thanks.
