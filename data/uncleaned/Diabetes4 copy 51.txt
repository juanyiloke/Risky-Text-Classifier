Been NaughtyI have been very naughty with my diet over Christmas and I dread to think what my BG reading will be ,also my Cholestrol.When I came home from Hospital I was determined to watch my diet ,but with one thing and another I have sadly gone astray,So must get back on course again ASP. I was very surprised  while in Hospital that there was no Dietician checking on  my choice of food, I could order anything I wished,though I tried to be sensible, and the staff were monitoring my bBG, When I mentioned  this to a nurse she said it was because the hospital  no longer prepares their own meals , they are all prepared ,ready meals
