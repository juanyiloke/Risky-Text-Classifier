I can't do this anymore *TRIGGERS*Started by Rosco33?, 10-03-15 11:50 AMHi everyone,My name is Ross. I'm 33 years old. On 10th September 2014 my boyfriend of 10 years left me. He says that he is not in love with me anymore and he moved out on 12th September 2014 leaving me in the house where we lived together. During this time I have been to hell and back, suffering with depression, grieving for my loss and having to take weeks off work. I considered suicide a few times but obviously didn't go through with it. It has been 6 months today and I feel like I just can't take anymore of this. I'm struggling to let go of my ex, I love him so damn much. I wish I didn't. I do not know how to turn these feelings off. I cannot continue feeling so unhappy and having spouts of what I feel are like emotional breakdowns. I'm so unbelievably unhappy right now. I've tried all sorts to help get myself through this pain. Ive joined a gym and I'm working hard, training with my personal trainer 3 times per week, which is great and it does take my mind off of things, but that simply only blocks it out temporarily. I cannot tell my boss at work that I appear to have slipped back. The company including my boss supported me so much last year, having taken 8 weeks off work and was given full pay. I cannot afford to take anymore time off work as I fear that my employer cannot understandably support me in the same way again, meaning I would have no money coming in and would not be able to pay my bills and rent. I do not want to keep feeling this pain and cannot see another way out. I have spoken to my GP, a counsellor etc in the past but nothing really helps, I cannot switch off these feelings for my ex. Everyday, every moment I feel like I'm been torn apart into shreds from inside. Please help me. I do not know what to do.
