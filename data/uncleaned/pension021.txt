Cycle lanesI am a very occasional cyclist, but whenever I do cycle and there is a cycle lane available, I always use it. So my question is, to those keen cyclists out there, should it be compulsory for cyclists to us a cycle lane, if one is available? And should it be an offence not to use a cycle lane, if one is available? I ask this because where I live there is a fast (50 mph) single lane road running along the coast which goes for several miles, there is a perfectly good, off road cycle lane, but there is an increasing tendency for the very keen lycra clad “true cyclists” to ignore the cycle lane and ride, usually in a bunch of 10 or more, on the main road, which causes hold ups and I think could be very dangerous. What are your thoughts?
