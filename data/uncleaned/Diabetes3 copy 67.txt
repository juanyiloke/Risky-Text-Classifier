Advice - eating while away/holidayI'm at a weekend conference in a months time (I've been so excited about going & paid quite a bit. Have ppl relying on my going too!)I was already concerned about eating while I'm there but I went out (only to harvester!) tonight as a bit of a treat with a friend & was quite good - having salad & the chicken. I'd done loads of walking today & hardly ate (only managed a bowl of homemade soup with like 13g carbs in & very low fat) so had the Icecream there. I've been ill with my stomach ever since I got home. Actually felt very shaky, hot & just wrong about 5 mins after finishing & I'm worried about how on earth I will manage next month!Any advice would be appreciated
