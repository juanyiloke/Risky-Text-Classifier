ÊNot sure if what I did is good or bad..Last night, I had two friends over, and we all decided to do some random night time country driving to just get out. After some time, somehow we ended up in the same spot that my ex and I used to run to to get away for awhile. I was overcome with flashbacks again. I couldnt shake it off. I sat on the same big rock at the river's edge that we used to sit on and absolutely came unglued. I couldn't stop thinking, " Why?!!" and "If we both had gotten help, this would never have happened!" Overcome with flashbacks, heartache, and anger, I sat on that rock and bawled until I was sick. My friends were shocked and afraid; they had never seen me break like that. When asked what was wrong, I poured it all out. The flashbacks, the emotional hell..what caused this...everything. They were speechless. I was always the strong one who "sucked it up and moved on", seemingly undaunted by anything. And there I was, crying like an abandoned child in the middle of nowhere.ÊAnd now that Ive exposed so much, Im afraid. I dont want them to think I'm "crazy" or go telling others about this. I have serious trust issues. They havent even called to check on me since last night and that scares me. Did I scare them? Do they think I'm nuts? Who knows.Today, it has rained all day. I should be out searching for a job, but I can't get out of bed. All I've done today is eat and sleep. Feel like I need to cry but can't. Can't shake the memories and the heartache. Despite the betrayal, the lies, the heartache....truthfully, I never stopped loving him. I never wanted to have to give up on him.And I feel utterly weak because of that.I get angry at myself for being this way alot.ÊI think I need to crawl back into bed and cry. If I can.
