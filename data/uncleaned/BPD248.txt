ÊThe Baby.I've shied away from talking about this for some time because it's really eating away at me, but I've come to see this forum as a friendly and somewhat impartial place so I feel comfortable sharing this here. About 8 months ago, my ex-girlfriend became pregnant. She promised me she was taking the pill but lied about that and then found out about the pregnancy but lied for weeks until I noticed. In the immediate, we broke up because I freaked and didn't know what to do but after a few months of careful consolation, I decided that I might be able to take that step with her, so we got back together. Then her parents found out about my BPD and various self harm issues and forbid me to ever see her or the child ever again-I never got to have a say in the name or anything, and I didn't find out the gender until the rest of Facebook already had... I felt that all this was quite unfair and for months this has been a real pressure point for suicidal tendencies but recently, I found out that she is seeing someone else, and that they intend to put (him) up for adoption. Now I'm in a really destructive conundrum-I obviously want to see him and it would kill me to see him given away but at the same time with my mental health issues, I'm not really in a place where a small, innocent baby can rely and depend on me. I'm really feeling the pressure right now and I'm worried if I don't work this out I'm gonna break down. I just don't know what to do and I'm really scared right now...
