Emergency contraception in pharmacies - changesI'm posting this for information for anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation and needing emergency contraception (these things do after all happen!).On visiting a pharmacy today to get emergency contraception (Norlevo, which is the standard 'morning after pill') I was advised that due to studies showing reduced efficacy in women over a certain weight, pharmacists have been advised against dispensing this medication to women weighing over 75kg (and yes, they did weigh me to check!). Women over 75kg 'should' now to be referred to a GP for prescription of an alternative. I say 'should' because the only information I could find online (linked below) talks in guidance terms rather than rules as such. The pharmacist insisted there was a big publicity campaign about this and perhaps there was, but I didn't know anything about it. As I am currently staying up the country I couldn't visit my own GP but the pharmacist referred me to a local one and I got sorted in the end (with ellaOne).Frantic googling didn't turn up anything of note (like a publicity campaign!) but there is an information sheet courtesy of the Irish College of General Practitioners here which explains in more detail. The pharmacy was a national chain and the pharmacist said this is uniform practice across their stores so just a heads up that if you're over 75kg you may encounter difficulties in obtaining the type of emergency contraception available at pharmacies and may be referred to a GP. It was a little upsetting for me at the time and knowledge is power...or so they say.
