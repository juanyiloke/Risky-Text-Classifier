Use of tamulosin after a failed prostate operation I received radiation treatment which reduced the psa from6.0 to 0.7.. Ater a number of years the psa rose to around two which shoed a doubling so I was prescribed bicalutamide which again reduced the psa.it has now started to rise again.I believe the radiation caused some damage to the urethra and my prostate is slightly enlarged.Urinary dynamiss show restricted flow and irritable bladder resulting in increased toilet visits.Aturps op has been reccommended which I am not happy about and I have been on Tamulosin for ten days.So far this drug has had little. Effect but I need to know whether the drug acts straight away it might it take longer to act.Any comments would be welcome.
