Filling The Void...Any one fill as thought they constantly have to keep talking. I hate uncomfortable silence and it makes it squirm when the conversation drys up and someone is looking directly at me so i just try and keep talking to take that attention from me if that makes sense! I think alot of it is down to shame and not liking being in the spotlight. My councellor pointed it out today at therapy that she notices i feel uncomfortable when their is a natural pause, Does anyone else feel like this and do you have any coping mechanisms?
