Loneliness and needing loveThings are not going well with my partner and he is struggling to communicate to me (while I struggle communicating with him) what has changed with us. He says I'm different and I don't have the fight I used to. I think I do, but so much gets used up internally. Anyways- yeah, things are not going well and my partner has also been sick and struggles with depression and is working on his honours paper. So often I just ACHE to be held- like a true hug that says he is there. I don't know how to tell him how deep this need is and am terrified he will say he can't and he can't keep going with us. He has said he feels just as lost in this...Since I've felt things change in our relationship I've thrown myself even deeper into work. I'm a disability support worker, working with people in their every day lives and so affection often comes in. I find it helps but because my work has been taking over (as my relationship has been hard) my partner says he doesn't feel like I save anything for him. It's a big mess and I'm trying so hard to sort it out but any support or words of advice would be appreciated.ÊI think the reason I need this connectedness with people is because I feel so lost from myself. People and my pets are so much a part though, but I don't have words to say how deeply I love my partner
