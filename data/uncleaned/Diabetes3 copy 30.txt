In a pickleHello all,I've not been around for ages. For several reasons, but one being denial.Anyhow, I will cut straight to the point....well, points actually.I'm still on 4x500mg metformin per day.I'm ignoring my annual review invite from the nurse.My blood is hitting between 17.9 and 19.4 for the last few nights. I understand one of those as it reflects what I ate, kind of. But I think carbs are knocking me up to this level on other night, which has not really done so before, not that high anyway. I'm getting very thirsty and physically tired quickly at these numbers.I'm also having to get up for pees at silly o'clock. Despite almost five years down the line with this diagnosis I'm....If anyone has any wise words, advise or a holiday house somewhere quiet, I'd be very grateful In return I can advise on gallbladders, appendix ops, mother in laws or rescue dogs!Hebs xx
