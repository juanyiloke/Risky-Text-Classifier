Out of Control.I honestly feel lost right now. I'm in a downward spiral, constantly spinning and spinning in chaos. Just going down and down and down. Up until a couple of weeks ago, my ED had been getting better. I, myself, had been getting better. I was eating up to two meals a day plus a snack, and drinking plenty of fluids. The downward spiral didn't seem to start until I went to the doctors for a check up and I saw my weight, the Doctor didn't allow me to step up onto the scale backwards. I had to talk about my ED and my history and everything with this new Doctor. As if that wasn't hard enough before. Now, I'm back down to eating only one meal a day with a snack, if that, and barely drinking even half of a glass of any fluid. I've even considered b/p again and I haven't done that for months. The thought of starting C&S has even crossed my mind, and that terrifies me. I no longer know what to do.
