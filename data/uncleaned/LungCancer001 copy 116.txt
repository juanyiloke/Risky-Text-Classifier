1 x 2.5 cm mass Lobectomy 11-1322 days ago the Emergency room found a 1 x 2.5 cm mass in lower right lobe during a ct scan for my back. PET has come back positive for cancer , not in lymph nodes or anywhere else.Tomorrow is my lobectomy. They are doing a VATS, will biospy it during the surgery, and continue with the lobectomy after confirmation. I am so scared.
