How Do You Stop A Bad Habit?Have you ever been able to stop a bad habit? If so, how??Lately I have been gnashing my teeth and moving my left ankle back and forth mindlessly (or tapping it). These things just start up by themselves and carry on, without my even being consciously aware of them! When I do finally become aware of them, and stop them, they stop for awhile. However, as soon as my mind wanders to anything else, these habits start up again.I think they are because I am under extremely heavy stress right now, and these things are some kind of nervous release. I suppose in that light they are in some way a comforting thing. With the foot tapping, it will tap to the beat of some music I am listening to. I guess the jaw moves to music too, given the opportunity.I am afraid that I will get TMJ with the jaw moving like that, if I cannot stop it from doing so. Also, with the gnashing of my teeth, I could wear down some of them and then they would be more susceptible to cavities.Any suggestions on how to stop these bad habits are more than welcome!
