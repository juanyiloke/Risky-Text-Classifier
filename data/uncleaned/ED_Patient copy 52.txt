Early signs of???? help anyone?Hi, right i know this will sound crazy but ever since last week, i have started a diet. I dont know how i came about it but I am 5 ft 2 and i weighed 137 pounds and i thought that was too big and i just counted calories for one day as an experiment to see how much i ate and i was shocked to find it was 2000 so i since then i have not eaten over 1000, i simply cut out food or replace food so i manage to stay under 1000.one day i only ate 500 and i felt like that was good but i know its not the normal amount. i weigh myself at least 6 times a day, even when i dont realise i am doing it and i drink herbal tea all the time which is a diretic (dont know how to spell it) i felt fine the first few days but today on the way to college i felt sick and couldnt eat all day so today i only had 700. can someone help i tried not to count them today but i felt like i left a candle burning in my room if i didnt, its quickly becoming bad an i know its only a week but i dont want it to be serious i am now 128 pounds and dont want to be too thin. what should i do?
