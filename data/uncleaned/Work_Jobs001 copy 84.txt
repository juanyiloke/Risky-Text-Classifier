  Back pain forcing me to quit________________________________________I've been working in a general assistant position for a facilities management/catering company for over a year now, there is a lot of manual handling and about 3 months into the job I hurt my back. I took a weeks holiday, put plenty of ice and rest etc. and took it a little bit easier (which is hard because there is a lot to do as we are very short staffed). eventually I hurt it again, I went to a chiropractor who told me he'll fix me, I'll go back and hurt it and be back with him again, I went to a gp and he gave me anti inflammatories, which helped but now the pain is getting to much and I had to take more time off to try heal. A few people in work are telling me I should just refuse to do my job and ask to be put something else, but my manager is telling me that we're short staffed and I'm leaving them in the lurch by taking holidays and they're going to be really stuck while I'm off. I feel liek I have no choice to leave but with the job market being what it is I dont think I'll get another job anytime soon, I guess this post is mostly venting but I'm wondering do I have any rights to refuse doing my job now as its wrecking my back.TL;DR, I've a bad back from work and I'm wondering if I can make them give me something else to do.
