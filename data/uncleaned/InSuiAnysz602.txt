I've been treated unjustly by formal institutions and authorities and now I'm being abused by a cocaine addict who is seriously crazy. I have no solid proof to fight back and there is no one to help me. Just absolutely no one to prove that I'm right and no one to understand and support me. I cry everyday since 2013 and I'm never happy.ÊThese days, I'm trying to find a successful way to end my life. I tried tasting laundry detergent in the morning and I didn't like it. Would drinking certain amounts regularly kill me or just make me sick? I don't want to end up paying money to get well to the hospital. I would like to know a better way to die witout serious pain. I also want someone to share their own experience.ÊI hate a lot of people who just think about themselves and try to take advantage of my situation and satisfy their own greed. Everything that I longed for is gone and I don't have any chance to go back to the life I had before this devastating event that made me sick and want to kill myself. I would appreciate some support from people who lost all hope and want to do the same thing that I want to do.ÊThe most difficult part of being suicidal is if you can't do it right away you have to keep living but staying alive is hard because you have to be active and do stuff because you'll regret afterwards if you don't and you're still alive.ÊI live in South Korea but I'm willing to participate in a suicide attempt done in a group anywhere in the world.ÊThanks.
