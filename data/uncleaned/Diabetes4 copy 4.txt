BeginnerI'm the wife of a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic.  He's 76, a working farmer, and refuses to change his eating habits.I am coeliac (gluten intolerant) so am used to dealing with diets and not really fazed by the necessity for getting him to eat healthily - except that he refuses to do this and goes out and buys himself crisps and chocolate etc which he eats on the sly.  His feet are a total mess with fungus infection in all 10 nails, and he can eat 1lb of apples plus 1lb pears and a punnet of grapes at one fell swoop and try to tell me they are 'slimming'.Needless to say he is grossly overweight.He has fallen under the spell of a 'nutritionist' who's selling him expensive slimming shakes which are supposed to replace meals twice a day.  However he eats one of these AS WELL AS his ordinary meal, and makes himself an extra one before bed.  To my mind he's getting twice as many calories a day as I'm cooking.How do you go about helping someone like this?  Am I going to spend my old age nursing a sick man?
