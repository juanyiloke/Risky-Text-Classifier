You are going to think I am absolutely nuts, but here it goes. I can tell the future. Not directly, but accidentally. I can't just say "This is going to happen on XXX at XX:XX. I'll say things, and then forget about them, but then somehow, that is fulfilled. Kinda hard to understand, so here is a few examples. 1.) I had a really good friend in grade school. He lived with his mother in Kansas. His father lived in Indiana, and they were not close, at all. His mother was really all he had. One day, I was just thinking about random things, and I thought, "Wow, wouldn't that suck if his mom died? He would have nowhere to go". A month or so later, his mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, and died shortly after. As soon as I heard the bad news, that thought that I had had earlier shot back into my mind. Did I predict this? Did I cause this to happen? 2.) I used to get a ride home from another friends mom. She would pick up my friends older brother, and my older brother from the highschool, and then come pick us up at the grade school, and then take us home. His mom made the comment, "This is my last year doing this. Next year XX will be taking you to school" XX was a fairly wild kid, and I thought to myself, "Oh god, I would do anything to not have to ride in a car with him behind the wheel" 5 months later, he was found dead in his room. He had had an epileptic seizure, and died in his sleep. 3.) One of my brothers friends had got his pilots license. There was a concert they wanted to go to in another state, and they thought that they would fly a plane to the airport, and then take a cab to the show. The lineup was My brother, his friend with the pilots license, his dad (also with a pilots license), and 2 other friends. My brother could not pay the fee for renting the plane, so he decided not to go. A thought shot into my head, "At least he won't be there when the plane goes down". I don't know what made me think that. It was just this thought that popped into my head, as if someone had placed it in my mind. The night that they were flying to the concert, the plane went down over a field. The boy and his father both were killed, and his 2 friends were severely injured. This doesn't always happen with large things, like death. It can happen to little things too. Here is one that happened today. I was sitting in US History spacing out after I finished my test. I was thinking about what I was going to do with my brother when he came home from college on the next break. There are a bunch of bronze statues downtown, so I thought we might go check them out. And image popped into my head of my brother posing with one of the statues, kissing it. 3 hours later, in chemistry, someone was showing me their photos that they took when they went to Washington D.C. this last weekend. We were flipping through the photos, and then I saw a picture of her posing, kissing a bronze statue in D.C. Am I crazy? Things like this happen all the time. Is it happening for a reason? Is there some greater force that is putting these thoughts into my head? Why? This probably sounds fabricated to you, and I don't blame you. If someone else were telling me this, I would laugh it off and call their bluff. To tell you the truth, if there is something that is telling me these things, I am not sure that I want to know. I am scared that this is not fiction, scared of what they are telling me is the truth. I hope they will tell me the answers in my sleep, because I don't know if I can take it. h.e.l.p.
