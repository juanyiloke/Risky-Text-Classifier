What relaxation technique helps you cope with stress ?I was introduced to the topic 'relaxation' first when I had to teach 'breathing & relaxtion' to the pregnant mums and dads in antenatal classes when I was working; I had to convince them of the value of learning any relaxation method at all! There are many techniques of realaxation, some physical some mental. For example I have just had a lovely walk on Dartmoor in the sunshine, others enjoy walking on the beach and there are some that love cycling   Relaxation as a coping strategy for stress does not have to be passive !! Tuning into one's breathing has long been a method of relaxation, visualisation exercises, meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi all have a place too. Some methods are designed to cope in the short-term with stress, such as taking a deep breath and counting to ten, other methods are like acquiring a longer term skill ie they need practise and committment  Coping with pain, fear of the unknown, even loss of control of one's own body is a stress shared in a way by those ante-natal groups and those of us here in this online bowel cancer 'club'. In those days of old, relaxation was acknowledged as an important coping strategy for childbirth and was always included in classes (at least 6 sessions allowing plenty of practice!)The Relaxation Method I used to teach was called the Mitchell Method after Laura Mitchell, a physiotherapist who suffered dreadfully from athritic pain. She worked out for herself, using her knowledge of how muscles and joints worked and based on physiological priniciples, a method of relaxation to help her cope with the pain. If anyone would like to know more I will describe the basic principles, but I would be interested in hearing other's coping strategies
