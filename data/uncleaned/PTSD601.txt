Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; Is There a Normal?Posted 10 days agoHello to all who may fall upon this post. I have been experiencing PTSD since I was 12 and diagnosed when I was 16. I experienced a range of trauma for years and different instances of trauma. I have experienced epiosdes (as I like to call them) that seem to last days. I often get them erracticly throughout the day because I fall upon many triggers and reminders that seem unavoidable. For example a friend might casually mention something such as a news article and a certain key word triggers a memory that triggers others. It has greatly impacted how I function with those I care about and my education. No matter how devoted I am to succeed I find that the flasback and nightmares steal away time and energy that I much rather spend getting educated. I sometimes am only functioning 2 days out of the week. It is hard for those around me to understand , and its hard for me to describe that I relive things in my head that I cant get away from. My question to whomever is, is this normal for all, most, some, or whatever, victims of PTSD to have experiences like mine where for 16hrs or for days you experience flashbacks to where reality gets blurry? I suppose I would simply like to hear from others with PTSD, their experiences with this disorder and what they or you have done to be able to function and have a healthy lifestyle? Please and Thankyou
