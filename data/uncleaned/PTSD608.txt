ptsd and rapePosted 11 days agoHi I'm back again It's Sam, nickname Frances, been out for a while due to no computer connection.  Need female support and hugs, was raped at 19 and buried it for 22 years, tried counselling, speaking to a c.b.t therapist and my doctor, the last one was the best I'd have to say!  I am trying to conceive and have found the c.b.t has highlighted ptsd due to events in the past  ie this.  Don't like sex all sorts of hang ups due to my past and nearly lost a really close friendship due to this, just feel dreadful as I'm sure but need evidence that it is events from the past that are stopping me from conceiving.  Does anyone know where I can turn or what I can do next, just desperate to have someone else share my life, am aged 42 and feel he's ruined my chances forever!  Please help this is SO hard!
