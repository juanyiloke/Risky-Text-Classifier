no friendsI have spent too much of my life focusing on my weight and eating patterns. I do not go out. I don't really have friends outside of my family. I have never been on a date. I am 26 and have the social life of a 4 year old. I don't know how to change this. How does one go out and make friends when they have to go out on their own? I am not an outgoing person and I have never been good at sharing my feelings. Anybody else in a similar situation?I have really been wanting to tell someone about my eating disorder. I won't tell my family. I think it is unfair to them to have to worry about my eating patterns and the last thing I want is to be monitored all the time (they have done it once and I don't want to go back there). And to be selfish, I also think it is unfair to me. I want to overcome this for me and not because I feel guilty about hurting my family. My councilor used my family as a tactic for getting better when I was anorexic and it did not work out so well. How do I find someone to talk to about this?
