How Do You Trust?Its a pretty simple question for an incredibly complex topic.ÊHow do you trust?ÊI can trust the big things, like that the sun will rise tomorrow. Its incredibly difficult for me to trust in anyone.ÊBackground.ÊMy childhood home was like one big mind f*ck where you could never trust anything that my mother told me. Things would change....always at the last minute, and always at her whim for no real good rhyme or reason. I know this is the root of why I cannot trust.ÊI know I must learn how to trust or my life is going to be very lonely. I only have a few online friends and a few family members at this point. I've alienated everyone else.....friends, family, etc. by my inability to trust in anything.ÊDo you start with the little things?ÊI trust that so-and-so says what they mean and means what they say. When they tell me that they are going to do ABC for me, I trust that they will follow through. In this sense, I can indeed have a sense of trust.ÊWould this approach work? Building from the little things up to the bigger things over the course of time.ÊThank you. I am lost.
