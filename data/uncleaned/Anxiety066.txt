Worried about talking to doctor about anxiety problem Ê18    I'm new to this board.I've had issues with worry and anxiety my entire life, and as far as I know I was born this way.Ê There was never anything in particular that triggered it.Ê My parents, and everyone else, just considered me a worrier, but never really knew how bad it was.About 7 years  , I noticed my anxiety slowly getting worse and worse.Ê I've been trying to figure out why, but have come up empty.Ê At the time I really didn't know much about it until I Googled it.I exhibit almost all of the mental symptoms - irritable, agitated, fatigue, self-conscious, sense of detachment, fear of going crazy, poor memory, trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, worry, expecting the worst, frequent anxiety attacks.I also have a lot of physical symptoms - light headed, headaches often, muscle tension, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, chest pain/tightness, upset stomach, restless, frequent urination, digestive/intestinal issues, twitch/shakes/tingling.I've never seen a doctor about it, probably because I'm too damn anxious about it.Ê I worry he won't believe me, or that I am just after some meds or something.Ê I also find it pretty embarrassing.Ê I was getting to a breaking point and knew it.Ê Every day I could feel things getting worse and worse.Ê I was having almost daily anxiety attacks, but thankfully I was able to take some extended leave from work for unrelated reasons.Ê That leave is ending in a few weeks, and I am still a wreck, so I've got suck it up and go see my doctor.Ê Any advise?
