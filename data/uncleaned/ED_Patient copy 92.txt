Anorexia to Bulimia?Hi there i have been suffering from anorexia for about 4 months now, admitted to hospital back in november 2013 with a heart rate as low as 18 at night and 22 through out the day. I was in the heart ward for a week in intensive care, then transferred to adolescent for 4 weeks. I was let out a day before christmas, then had to attend an outpaitent app a week later to then be re admitted for 3 weeks. I was finally discharged with a stable normal heart rate and 10kg heavier. Things have been tough but okay since being out, i have good and bad days. However the past week i have started binging on everything, hungry all the time finding myself eating sooo much   is this normal? I have also thrown up a few times, not sure if its my body has over eaten or what. I had the urge to force myself last night from feeling so sick. Am i bulimia now? is this a bad thing? please help!
