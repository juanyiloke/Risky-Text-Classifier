Tubular Breast Cancer and Tamoxifen¥	Hi . I have just joined and am looking for some help . I was diagnosed in March 2013 with a pure tubular 7 mm tumour. I had a WLE and clear sentinel node biopsy and 15 sessions of rads. At my initial meeting with my oncologist we discussed tamoxifen and I decided to take it - my husband and I remember him saying he thought that was sensible although he did tell me that with my diagnosis the additional benefit to me was very small - 1 % . Roll on 2 years and I went to see same oncologist on Friday. I have been having some issues with my womb and wanted to  discuss if I could change to an AI . He really surprised me by saying he would not put me on an AI as he did not want to make me feel like an old woman and he was happy for me to stop taking the tamoxifen - he even seemed to be saying he thought I should stop whether or not these latest round of gynae tests show I do have another problem with the womb. He said my risk of recurrence was small as was my risk of a new primary and if it did happen they would deal with it !!!!!! I have been left a bit baffled. He showed me the nhs predict tool so I can see the figures and where the 1 % comes from and I have found out in America the guidelines for pure tubular are - under 1 cm - no hormone therapy - but ladies here with pure tubular do seem to take it and everything you read makes you think you would be daft not to take tamoxifen if you have an ER + bc. I am not going to lightly dismiss his view - he is the oncologist after all but I am a bit anxious about it. I perhaps do not agree with him being quite so matter of fact about saying we would deal with it if it came back - further surgery and rads at best is hardly the same as say a course of antibiotics to clear up a returning infection !! For the moment I am continuing to take it. Can anyone help ? Thank you.
