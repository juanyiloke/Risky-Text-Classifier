Hey guys :) im not on this bored much at the moment because im focused on other health probs im having. I just wanted to share with you the treatment that has helped me so much.I have struggled with Asthma since I was 12. I cough ALOT. I have been on every steroid, inhaler, antihistamine etc.. My Doc got me straightened out and I wanted to share it with you guys in hopes it might help someone else. First of all for those who don't see specialist Do!! My pulmonary Dr is awesome. Worth it!! So I started Dulera. If you have insurance and want to try it do. For me it was a life savor. IF you don't have insurance Forget it its freaken expensive. Or if you have a DR that can give you lots of Dulera samples. So I take Dulera, Ventalin and combivent when im really flared up. Every night I do two puffs Ventalin then wait a few and do two of the Dulera. If im super sick or coughing a lot I use cheritussin. Not enough to make you loopy just enough to calm my coughing. During the day I use Combivent if Its still flared up. Which I have not needed. IF you really bad you can do Dulera morning and night which really helps me get though. I never know doing the ventalin first opens up your air ways so the Dulera can work better. I cant remember what they are called but the long plastic tubes kids use for there medicine really works well to. Gets the meds straight to your lungs. Anyway Im in no way a rep just a person who has suffered with Asthma for a very long time and wanted you guys to know what helps me. Maybe it will help someone else here. Good luck!!... Mountains
