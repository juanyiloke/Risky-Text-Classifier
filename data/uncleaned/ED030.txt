Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake DisorderAfter years of denial and the frustrating ambiguity of EDNOS I feel a lot of validation with the DSM-V's new diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. My eating disorder goes hand in hand with my other mental illnesses (PTSD, chronic depression and panic disorder with agoraphobia) and I'm still grappling to understand it as I'm coming out of a hospitalization and starting to be really honest with myself. I just found this board while sitting at my desk at work, avoiding an office birthday party and watching in disgust as my coworkers eat multiple cookies. I have to emphasize that I don't have a self image/weight issue, I'm not judging them for eating sweets, it's literally a disconnect with my appetite that makes me not want to eat unless I'm starving and it hurts. I guess this is getting sort of random, I just wanted to know if there were others on here that specifically identify as AFRID. I need a little empathy to get through days like today.
