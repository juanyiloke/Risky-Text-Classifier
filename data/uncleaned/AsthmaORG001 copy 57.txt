Cough Variant Asthma, anything working? Looking for help! Hi allI'm new to the forum but sadly not to CVA :( Having had the worst 12 months ever I basically sat in the GP clinic & refused to move on Friday. I feel so low it's not true - worn out by coughing all night, can't do my job properly during the day as I cough constantly, my ribs hurt, my head hurts & I'm fed up! People comment on it constantly as if I am infectious, it's really getting me down. She has referred me for a chest x-ray (all clear previously) and says if it's clear again this time then I'm back with the consultant, but they don't seem to have any way of getting it under control other than weeks of steroids which make me feel awful. I take lanzoprazole in case of reflux, a nasal spray in case of nasal drip, cetirizine for allergies & montelukast as a long acting help for my airways - have tried every single inhaler & they actually just irritate me & make me cough. So - I just wondered if anyone has tried anything different which has made a difference? Natural remedies or treatments? Rant over - good not to feel so alone with thisCheersLisa
