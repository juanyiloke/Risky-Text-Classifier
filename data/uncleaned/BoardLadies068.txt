Skinny ShamingTwo friends of mine were having a discussion about "skinny shaming" and whether it's really a valid problem to be placed alongside fat shaming. Points were made that slogans like "real women have curves" are just making naturally slim women feel bad about their bodies, which were countered by the argument that skinny shaming can be likened to reverse racism.ÊTo me, I think they're two sides of the same coin really that seeks to just pit women against each other.ÊJust wondering if anyone here has experienced skinny shaming or do you think it's as bad as some people would have you believe?(btw, the conversation arose out of Nicki Minaj's new music video in which she says "fcuk you skinny bitches" or words to that effect).
