My strategies for EasterMy strategies for the Easter long weekend:Log on to the BB website and read all the posts so I don't fel like I'm on my own.ÓFold out the divan in the lounge room and pile on the doona and pillows to facilitate spontaneous napping.Give the cats extra cuddles and belly rubs.Buy a gorgeous chocolate cake from the french bakery that I can slowly work my way through over the next 4 days.  Chocolate being one of the 5 main food groups and therefore an excellent choice for breakfastHave lots of books, DVD's and crosswords on hand.  Not very rock'n'roll I know, but it makes me happy.Buy enough Thai food for 4 days so I don't have to cook or wash too many dishesEnsure that my baking supplies are fully stocked in case I get the urge to bake something.Trawl the internet for funny utube videos.Hope you all have a safe and happy Easter.
