Screaming for the help I'll never getI'm sick and tired of asking for the help I never get. I've tried so many different things and everyone just doesn't care. I've gotten to the point where the things that usually hold me back, don't anymore. Nothing's holding me back. This sounds bad but I feel no remorse for the people I'm gonna hurt, I used to get upset thinking about hurting them but now I don't. I don't care who I hurt and that's incredibly selfish I know but I just stopped feeling guilty. I'll lie here in bed thinking its probably gonna be within the next few days and when I picture it, I start crying. I don't know why, I'm not scared, I'm not worried and I don't feel bad anymore. I think I'm crying because I'm sad it's gotten to this point. I'm crying because I'm sad that no one wants to help me, even the times I've ended up in hospital they didn't medicate me or have follow up counselling sessions. I'm crying because I'm sad that I mean nothing to everybody
