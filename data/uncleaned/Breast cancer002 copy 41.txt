To all ladies on Letrozole.......¥	Hi girls. I have been taking Letrozole for almost 2 years now. I have developed a love/hate with this drug. I love how it keeps me safe, but hate the sore joints it gives me. ¥	I have tamed the side effects with cod liver oil and glucosamine.¥	I recently bought my usual cod liver oil supplements from Holland and Barrett. I trust their quality. This time their best offer was cod liver oil with calcium. I thought I would give it a try..........IT IS MIRACULOUS!! The pain in my joints has stopped altogether!!¥	They should prescribe on the NHS!!¥	Hope this helps all you sufferers of side effects.¥	Love J xx
