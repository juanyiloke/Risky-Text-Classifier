People might be thinking something about me which isn't true?Sometimes i get my words mixed up, and others think i'm being a bit weird, more recently i was accused of sounding almost awkward and gay. I can tell you not that i am hetero, and if i wasn't i can assure you i would admit it, but i think some people might now think im a bit on the other side cos i said something that was meant as a joke, but it seemed to have got misinterpreted, and as i was quite stoned at the time i didn't real deal with it, and the room fell a bit awkward. I suffer with anxiety and this is why the whole thing is bothering me. If i was gay/bi it wouldn't, but the fact that i'm not and some people may think i am now is bothering me a bit. Should i care? Cheers
