distant...I've already lost my faith and hope; now I'm about to lose my job, my home, custody of my child, and my girlfriend. I used to care; now I hardly do. This Prozac and Olanzapine makes me feel flat and endlessly bored. Exercise, books, music, movies, they used to give comfort; now everything seems tainted and trite. The prescriptions are new, but the depression and anxiety is not. So many youthful years have been languished away, and the future appears no brighter. Time drones on, yet slips away so quickly. I curse the past, forsake the present, and fear the future, but I have no regrets. So much double mindedness. So much sadness.
