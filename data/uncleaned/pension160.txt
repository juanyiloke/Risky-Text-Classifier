Savings overseas.A friend tells me he has moved the bulk of his savings to Ireland and had them converted to Euros. This way he gets a bit better interest, but mainly he protects the cash from the decline in the £.He says he pays tax on the interest in the Uk and the scheme is quite legal.Does anyone know anything about this.    If it is legal it would be well worth while as the value of the £ is dropping like a stone
