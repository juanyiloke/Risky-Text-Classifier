ÊSupport needed please :)Hi,So I have just started to realise that I have an eating disorder, eating anything apart from salad makes me feel guilty and ill and I can barely look in the mirror because I believe I look so fat. I have also recently come to terms with the fact that I have depression after I started self harming.I have tried and tried to tell my parents indirectly, i hoped they would notice the scars or realise that my obsession with my weight is u healthy but my mum and sister just tell me to stop being so stupid because im not fat. While my dad works a lot so hasnt noticed. No-one saw my scar or if they did they didnt question them.The thing is I still want to lose weight and Im not sure Im ready to recover but I realky need soneone to talk tk abd counselling just didnt help. My friends havent noticed I am literally the meaning of the quote; the ones who smile the most are the saddest.- Loula
