This Is What Cured My Depression PermanentlyThis is what cured my depression permanently and I just want to share it. I do not advise anyone to stop taking counseling or medication without the direction and supervision of a medical professional.I apologize if I sound blunt or mean, but in order to beat depression permanently with no drugs, counseling or anything harmful to your health or life, there is only one thing I know that really works and it will take some real honesty with yourself. I know this from my own experience. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and tried everything from hotline's, counseling, therapy, medications (pharmaceutical and holistic) as well as illegal drugs, and I was still depressed until I discovered these things about myself and made the following choices.1. REALIZATION2. ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY3. RELEASING4. FORGIVING5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT6. TAKING CONTROL(REALIZATION) - I REALIZED THAT I AM THE CAUSE OF MY OWN THOUGHTS THAT WERE CAUSING MY DEPRESSION - I could no longer BLAME OTHERS, my past experiences, chemical imbalance or anything else for that matter! There are many things that we have no control of that we can either CHOOSE to be sad about, or we can also CHOOSE to allow those things to make us stronger.(ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY) - I ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING THE ONE TORTURING MYSELF - For whatever the reason I had believed that I deserved to suffer and I made sure that I would suffer at all times with any and all thoughts that were painful. With this knowledge, I learned to let go of self defeating beliefs.(RELEASING) - I STOPPED DWELLING ON MYSELF - I was so wrapped up with my own thoughts and feelings that I never took into consideration that anyone else or anything else mattered.(FORGIVING) - WITH THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING, I MADE THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION OF MY LIFE - I CHOSE that I forgive myself, and everyone who ever wronged me.( ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) I BEGAN TO LEARN APPRECIATION - I CHOSE to acknowledge the good in myself, in the world and in others.(TAKING CONTROL) - I CREATED A REALISTIC GOAL LIST - I made small goals that were easily obtainable and accomplished just one each day. With each goal that I completed, I developed a sense of accomplishment and that feeling empowered me and gave me the strength and the courage I needed to move forward in my life and to let go of the things I held on to in the past.THERE IS NO HOPE FOR A BETTER PAST, BUT THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE FOR A BETTER NOW AND A BETTER FUTURE, IF WE CHOOSE TO MAKE IT SO.It is truly our choices that make or break us.IT HAS BEEN NINE YEARS NOW AND I AM STILL FREE FROM THE CHAINS OF DEPRESSION  GOOD LUCK AND MY BEST WISHES TO YOU ALL !!
