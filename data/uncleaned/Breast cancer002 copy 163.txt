TM¥	Hi all, I'm hoping that some of you lovely ladies can help me. I'm due to have my op on 10th April and have opted for a Therapeutic Mammoplasty as my boobs are large and my surgeon says there is "plenty of volume" for him to achieve a good result. He was brilliant in explaining the operation to me but fell a bit short on the after care. I have an appointment with my bcn at clinic on Thursday to discuss in more detail but I know that I will get better info and advice from this forum. I just wondered if any of you have had this op as I don't recall seeing any posts where it is mentioned. Would love to hear from anyone with their experiences. Thank you xx
