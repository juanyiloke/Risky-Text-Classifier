How did I get here?I don't really know how I got to this forum or why I'm actually making a post. Here goes.ÊI'm a 25 year old bipolar, recovering alcoholic. 5 years sober. The past 6 years have been filled with tumultuous relationships, trying to find some sort of idea of what being truly loved felt like. Men who used me, beat me, stole from me, sold drugs out of my home.. I've been hospitalized about 6 times for failed suicide attempts, the last hospitalization being last January. That was not my last attempt though, the last was in June. I usually use things I keep lying around 'just in case'. Just in case I want to kill myself. I am in over my head with debt. I'm about to lose my car. I'm driving around uninsured. I can barely pay my rent. I'm dealing with awful body pain. I cannot, for the life of me, keep doing this. I don't want to do this anymore. There's nothing left for me. Everyone would be much better off without me. I just upset everybody, or they worry. When will her next breakdown be? And this is not worry because they don't want anything to happen. It's because when it does happen, it's so inconvenient for them. I barely get visits in the hospital. They barely answer my calls. Why do I bother? Nobody fucking cares. I don't know why I'm even posting this. You people don't know me, so it's not like you can feel any sort of anything about me.
