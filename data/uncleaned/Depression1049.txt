Time to face factsHello,Well after years of knowing that I suffer on and off from depression (self diagnosed), it has gotten to the stage where it has consumed me and I feel like it is ruining my life. Something needs to change and acknowledging it I guess is the first step. I am sure I don't need to tell people how I am feeling, the sadness, the hopelessness, the feeling of worthlessness, the anger and negative thoughts. I haven't been able to truly admit to even my partner, let alone anyone else that I am spiraling out of control into this blackness. I'm scared....scared to admit it, scared of his people's reaction, scared I can't come back from this.There are the added factors of having returned to Australia after years abroad, then moving cities for love, of not being able to find work and the endless battle with a stubborn 10kg adding to my poor self esteem and confidence.I don't want to go on medication. I need to find help, I need to find me again. I'm scared this is who I am and it's not the person I want to be but don't know how to change it.Until recently I had never thought about suicide but lately those thoughts pop in every now and again...life just seems too hard right now and nothing seems to make me happy. I don't laugh, I don't feel good, I don't enjoy anything.Is seeing a psychologist or therapist or counselor the first step? Can I really overcome this or is this the way my life will always be? I want to be a mother but I couldn't imagine having children while I am like this.Sorry, I'm babbling and not making any sense.
