jet lag and high bs levelsI have just come back from a wonderful 4 week holiday in Australia and New Zealand. The only downside is that my BS levels have been all over the place! I am on Novomix30 - 2 injections per day, and have kept to a reasonably low carb diet (no potatoes, rice, bread, pasta etc). I can understand the levels being high on holiday as I was eating at different times and doing far less exercise than normal.But i have been back for 1 week now, and levels are still all over the place! Ranging from a low of 3.5 to highs of 15. I am now over the symptoms of jet lag, and back into my usual routine of eating at set times and exercise.Has anyone else experienced this? How can I get my BS back to normal?
