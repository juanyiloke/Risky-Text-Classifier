Severe range for depression and anxiety / Cbt  sarah57117i had an assessment after struggling with depression and anxiety for yrs , finally went back on ADs just before xmas, after trying sertrailne , mirtazipine im now on venlafaxine , over the last 6 weeks its increased to 225mg. My assessment came out with a high score in the range of severe depression and anxiety . I have previouslyhad time off work due to this , however im doing my best to sttay at work as im only p/t and work with some fab ppl . However i feel like everything is getting too much again , i had gp last wk and i just said all was ok , it wasnt but my child was in the room so couldnt speak ,   Also had my first cbt session today a ' panic workshop ' one , even with them discussing panic attacks makes me feel edgy and havent been able to shake the feeling off since , i feel like im fighting a losing battle and just cant cope. So much has gone on recently , 7yr relationship breakdown / ended . Problems with child behavior , time off work last yr for an op that didnt go to plan ( should of been day surgery - 3 days in hospital , 7.5 wks off work ) moving house , family disagreements ( not to do with me but get dragged in ) Just so much - i dont know what to do , i feel like a whinge if i go back to gp again x
