I know I need to talk to my psychologist about my feelings especially the severe ones. I've been having suicidal thoughts that I would not act on now! At 16 I tried to get help and they sent me to a hospital where they abused and taunted us (I won't go into detail). I'm being treated for PTSD also. I'm more than terrified that if I talk, I'll be sent back there. I've even adapted to dealing with the "suffering" as long as I don't have to go back there. Can anyone relate/help? I have AIM it's IGotchuLove Thank you, Christy
