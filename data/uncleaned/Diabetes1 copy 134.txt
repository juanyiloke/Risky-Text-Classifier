BeerHi, whilst I am aware of the dangers of too much alcohol I have to admit to enjoying a pint or two on an evening. One of the problems is that my usual tipple (Carlsberg export) has 7g carbs per 275ml and I consider this a bit high. The other day it occurred to me that years ago I used to enjoy a drink called marston`s low c, the c standing for carbs, I have just found it again and at 1.65g carbs and zero sugar per 275ml I consider it well worth the 10 mile trip to stock up. In case anybody should be interested it`s a pale beer with a sharp, dry taste 4.7% abv and It`s called marston`s resolution low c. Real ale drinkers won`t like it because it has a slightly thin taste due to a double fermentation process which gets rid of the sugar and most of the carbs, but It suits me!
