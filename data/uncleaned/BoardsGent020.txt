i can guarantee you have never heard this one beforeOk before anybody asks I'm 26 male, straight and I've never even been remotely attracted to a man before, and as for women i'll get to that.Now that thats out of the way basically this is the story when I was growing up I went to a normal mixed primary & secondary school had a medium sized group of male/female friends meet up outside school and went to discos all the usual stuff, but was never in a relationship or kissed anyone, finished my leaving cert @ 17 went to college finished my bachelor deg at 21 and did my masters and completed that @ 23, had a relatively "normal" college exp. had friends went to class, meet up with people outside went for a few scoops, its not like i hit the books 24/7 and hid in my room for a couple of years, but still never got into a relationship or kissed anyone. This was mainly due to the fact that i was utterly indifferent to the exp and it never really bothered me about being in a relationship. Now for the last 3 years i've been working in a very small company with only 9 employees including myself and i've listened to my colleagues discuss their personal lives and their partners and I find myself wondering if i'm missing out?
