The Stroke Association - Charity Registration No. 211015     My brother in law & three friends have just completed the Coast to Coast walk in aid of the Stroke Association which took them 12 days walking in all weathers. They have raised over £3000 for the Charity. The Charity Walk was done as my sister in law' brother suffered a severe stroke a couple of years ago & he needs constant attention for ALL his needs.This Charity relies TOTALLY on the generosity of the public in order for it to support the Family of Stoke victims.If you wish to support them please follow the link:http://www.justgiving.com/c2c13-stroke.This is a picture of my brother in law having just finished the walk & was met by his family - his wife who's on the left is the one who elder brother suffered the severe Stroke.Thank you for you support.
