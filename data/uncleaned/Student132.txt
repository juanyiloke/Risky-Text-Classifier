When is a good time to ask my professor for a reference?by pyramidgodI need to ask my professor for a reference because in September I ll be applying for an exchange program. I'm not the best student in his class, but I went to his office hours several times, I would stay after class sometimes to ask him questions, and it's a small class, so he does know that I exist and that I do try. Anyway, my semester ends on April 13. Is it better to ask him for a reference on the last day (in his office of course) or should I ask him this week? Also, how should I approach him? I've never done this before and I'm rather nervous.
