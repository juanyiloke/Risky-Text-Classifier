COSTA - Who's in, who's out & who's just got home? I saw a thread from many years ago that was a place for people to let others know if they were in hossie. I thought it a good idea so that we know others are ok when they go silent. Also it means we can send best wishes to those that are captive and also give support when people have just got home. The first few days, weeks out of hospital can be very difficult. This is hopefully a way of giving support and reminding escapees that they are allowed to recover in their own time and just to remind them that we understand that others that don't suffer can assume that if you are at home you're better.Hope all are free at the moment and love to all that are captive.Erasmus.
