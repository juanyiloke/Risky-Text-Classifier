It...it makes no sense :/by mine turtleCouldn't find the right forum :/Three things:1. I didn't want to be here2. I didn't want this degree as my first choice (guess it was more of a hey, I can do that sort of thing)3. I've wanted out since I think 2nd yearStudying my degree (finals) and none of it makes any sense. The only thing that does is immunology so far which is just a logical sequence of events. Lectures are so hard to follow as well, because most of them aren't good speakers and go of on tangents and don't finish one topic before starting a new one in the lecture. Revising this stuff actually makes my brain hurt. I actually know less science now than when I started. May is going to be a good month This should probably have gone in the revision forum
