Dealing with personality conflicts in support groupHi guys. I started going to a local bipolar/depression support group a few months back. In general I would say it has helped some. At one meeting, however, I was offended by some of the comments of another member that I also found triggering. I left early because I started to cry and felt like if I spoke I would end up lashing out at this member.Has anyone had similar experiences or does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this sort of thing? I would hate to have to stop attending because of this.Thanks!Ê
