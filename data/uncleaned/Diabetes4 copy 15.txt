Running the Bristol 10K for INPUTHi allI've entered to run the Bristol 10K road race to raise funds for INPUT. It's only the second 'proper' running event I've ever entered, but mercifully it's all nice and flat along the river/around the harbour.If anyone fancies giving me a little encouragement and donating to INPUT's great work in helping more people to get access to better (and more appropriate) diabetes tech, please see the link below:https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/eduad'My Donate' is INPUT's preferred online fundraising channel as it means they get every penny of the donated money, rather than some of the others where small percentages are sliced off. I believe people can donate without needing to set up an account or anything dreary like that.Thanks!Mike
