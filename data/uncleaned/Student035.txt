Advice over extensionby Georg HegelIn 2014 I suspended/interrupted my studies in my third year voluntarily due to mental health problems (depression with possibility of bipolar and some kind of anxiety disorder). I was previously under a pdoc at my university but I have struggled to get anywhere at my local GP. I am still on referral lists since January and I cannot take any meds because they need a pdoc's supervision. I have tried my very hardest with the coursework but I have had to start from scratch, I missed most of my lectures and I didn't have any draft essays marked, and my mental health problems have only gotten worse. I had a job, which I had to take to pay for living costs, after I suspended but I was sacked in January due to my mental heath problems. I really want to get my university work out of the way but I am unable to, mental health wise. I struggle to eat and sleep. I can't remember when I last left the house. I feel like crap constantly, I don't know what day it is most of the time and I just want someone to help me. I have struggled and struggled with my essays but I have only managed to do three of the five modules.I don't know whether my university is going to take me seriously. I have submitted my request but it is going to be a long wait with the bank holiday. I am very worried they will say no. The person who is in charge of these requests has changed. I have chased up the NHS waiting list as well. I have tried going private but there is no one local to take my case. If I cannot work a job, which was pretty menial stuff, will they understand I can't do my essays??
