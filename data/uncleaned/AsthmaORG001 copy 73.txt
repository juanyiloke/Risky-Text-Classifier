So here's our petition calling for a ban in smoking at all London bus shelters - http://bit.ly/tflsmokePlease sign if you find smoking at bus stops a problem. The English public smoking ban doesn't extend to bus shelters that aren't more than half enclosed i.e. most bus shelters in London. However, TfL can ban smoking and require 'No Smoking' signs in all London bus shelters. Many cities do this in their own areas. This matters because 3 years after the public smoking ban, a study showed there were ~6,800 fewer hospital admissions for childhood asthma. The public smoking ban now has widespread support Ð a 2012 poll revealed 78% of adults were in favour. There has been a 2.4% national fall in hospital admissions for heart attacks as a result of the ban - equivalent to 1,200 fewer annual admissions.Hopefully we can get smoking stopped at bus stops in London - making it better for all those with lung and heart problems.
