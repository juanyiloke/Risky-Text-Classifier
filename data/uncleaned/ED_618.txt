Fear of chokingHi all,Recently I've been having really bad anxiety around eating & being petrified I'm going to choke on food. It's getting really out of hand & making eating even more difficult than it already is. I know its really irrational because I've never choked on food before, but its making food that much more difficult because I feel like I can only eat soft food & even then I've been having panic attacks when swallowing. I'm not sure whether this is in the right place as I don't feel its connected to my ED, more to my anxiety but its surrounding food so I've put it here. I'm not sure what anyone can say to make it any easier but I'm just hoping I'm not alone in this & maybe I can have some support? x x x
