ÊAnything to help with sleepingI'm so tired in the day but soon has it comes to going to sleep, my mind doesn't shut down it just thinks of everything that has happened whether it be years ago or that day then the future, it just doesn't stop.I tried all the relaxation stuff my psychiatrist gave me I don't drink/eat anything that can keep me awake after 4pm, tried listening to relaxing music, reading boring books.I've had sleeping tablets they worked but soon has I had stop them, back to normal. I tried kalms things didn't work, glass of warm milk before I go bed.I just wish my mind would shut down.ÊIt's 4:01am right now I been in bed since 12am so I thought I would post here see anyone has something I haven't tried.
