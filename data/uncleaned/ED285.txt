ÊIm new here. Wasnt sure who else to turn to. I dont think i can stop...Hi. My name is kim. Im 26 years old. I have had an ED for around 10 years now. I have been diagnosed with several different eating disorders over the years, i dont know which i am and i dont really want to be tied under a category or diagnosis i dont feel it will help in any way. Basically my main problem now is laxative abuse.ÊI have got to the point where i am fed up of my obsession with weight controlling my life. The number on the scales on a morning determines whether i have a good day or a bad day, it detirmines what i wear that day, what i eat that day etc etc. the thing thats bothering me as well as this is i feel hideous on a daily basis. I sometimes cant bear to look in the mirror and when i do so all i do is cry. Im in a relatively new relationship and i fear i am going to lose him due to how i am acting. I dont let him see me out of clothes, if i am feeling fat that day i dont let him touch me, it makes me uncomfortable if he calls me beautiful or says i look nice etc. i cant go on like this anymore. Where does it end? There is no future in this mindset. I need help :'(s
