Amazing consultantI can't get over this. I have the best consultant ever. I've never known such care. So as some of you know, I was given metformin to help with my insulin injections. I had some nasty side effects from taking the drug. Well, my consultant answered the email I sent in Saturday. I thought that was good, to be working on the weekend. Well, he got even better. I rang up Yesterday because I stopped taking the metformin as it was making me quite ill, and was told he would call me. He was working emergency all day today, and has only just finished, so he just phoned me.I have to say I'm impressed with his dedication. Is there any diabetes care award or something? Because over and over he's amazed me with his level of care. I'm so impressed. I've never had this much care before. I'm feeling really good. Like now I'm not fighting this battle by myself. Now I have someone on my side. Someone who can see the amount of work I put in, and who genuinely cares. I can't praise him enough. I wish I'd changed diabetes centres sooner. Thanks again northerner for advising me to change.
