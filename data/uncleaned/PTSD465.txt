ÊBig scare today....embarrassed myselfToday at university we had a group of applied theatre performers doing their show for us that they normally take in to schools, to begin conversations for kids around family violence, or bullying or child abuse......I knew this was going to happen.I did not know how realistically it would be acted.In the first 5 minutes there was a scene where one actor suddenly and unexpectedly yelled at the top of their lungs, aggressively, threatening the actor playing his wife......I began to feel panic and tears, then the actor yelled again and moved toward the person......I completely panicked. Tears, and jumped up, tried to find the exit(even though I knew where they were) and pushed through seated people to make it to the door.OMGosh. I am soooo embarrassed and ashamed! Thinking about it now brings back the feelings of panic.....and the fear!!!It was so sudden, and I reacted badly....... some days I truly HATE what goes on in my head/body that I just seem to have NO control over.ÊI suppose most of us experience this sometimes? How do you calm down afterwards?
