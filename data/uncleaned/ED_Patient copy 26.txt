My daughter has an eating disorder for 23 yearsI wonder if anyone can give me some support as I have no-one to share my fears with. My beautiful and intelligent daughter started cutting out cakes, biscuits, etc, at the age of 15. She was a size 14, but some girls at school said she was fat. She is now almost 38 and eats barely anything. She doesn't acknowledge her anorexia - she is also bulimic, and is currently working as an academic in Bosnia.I have just spent a week out in Bosnia with her and can see she has lost weight since I last saw her at Christmas. She is extremely thin though she thinks she is fat and is still desperately trying to lose weight from her legs. She won't eat anything remotely fattening - she is living on apples, yellow peppers and tomatoes. She will drink a cup of hot milk in the mornings.I am so afraid that something is going to happen to her. Amazingly, she seems well in herself and never gets colds or coughs. She has also suffered thinning of her hair and hair loss, which she has been told is genetic. I don't believe it is genetic at all, but due to her diet. As soon as I mention food and what she eats, she doesn't want to know.She is 5'7 and a size 6. I have no-one to discuss my fears with. If anyone is able to offer any help to me, I would be extremely grateful.
