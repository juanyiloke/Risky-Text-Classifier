Fear of an attack  5  Hello.Can I just apologise first for this long message and also please don't think I'm stupid.I was diagnosed with asthma about 6 months ago when I was getting breathless and tight chest; however as I started suffering with really bad anxiety and panic attacks the doctors (and me) wasn't sure if it was actually asthma or a physical symptoms of my anxiety/panic attacks.I was given a preventer and normal inhaler to use but I never did. Probably because part of my anxiety is I'm scared that taking medicine when not needed is dangerous.Today however I went to the doctors as I've had a cough for some weeks now and she said she could hear wheezing on my chest, which apparently means it's asthma.She told me I need to use my inhalers for 2 weeks and then go back.She told me to use the inhalers with this adaptor thing (which I haven't got).My fear now is:1. Does wheezing really mean it's asthma2. What happens if I don't take my inhalers (I'm scared to use them for 2 reasons - I don't have the adaptor thing and also apparently they increase your heart race (I already suffer with tachycardia so don't really want it increasing even more)3. How will I know if I'm actually having an asthma attack I'm just so scared and worry about everything so this is adding to my anxiety.Please could someone help me.
