Question about relapse...Okay, so I know now that relapse is apart of the recovering process but, I was extremely triggered today. My mother is a huge trigger. Anyway, so I went to write out my feelings and coping comfort words. Instead I planned out a meal plan. It's awful and not healthy at all. I am so anxious to do it but I'm more anxious about thinking about not doing it. It's extremely restrictive and eating a vegan diet I already stray away from a lot of foods. Is this a normal thing? Like am I the only one that makes an emergency relapse meal plan? What if I'm not strong enough to not follow it? I don't know what to do at this point. All I think about is the calories and how much better I'll feel when I lose some more weight.But then I thinkWill I actually feel better or just pretend I do...
