"you Need To Stop This.""You need to stop this, don't you see how alone you are?"ÊThis was said to me a few weeks ago in the middle of an angry panic attack and begging for the boundary I felt I needed to calm down - I needed to not talk about the trauma, take a break, not talk. Everything stop. Stop.ÊThe person who said it was the last person I would think would ever say something like that.Ê"Look around you, no one wants to be near you when you are like this. You are going to be left all alone with no one in your life."ÊYeah. I know. I would do ANYTHING to change.ÊI still couldn't stop and the image, the words, are burned into my brain and haunt me.Ê"Don't you see how alone you are?"ÊEvery minute of every day of my life and it hurts so bad I don't want to breathe anymore.ÊAll I do anymore is try so hard to fix me. It's all I do.
