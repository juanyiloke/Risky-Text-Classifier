Mucus problems________________________________________Is guaifenesin the only thing that can help get rid of mucus? Neti pots just dry out my sinuses more. I already use avamys corticosteroid nasal spray. I still need to get the proper size mask for my nebulizer and a prescription for the medication that goes in it. My nebulizer is one that was given to me. I need to get a letter from my family doctor and the prescription. Without the letter insurance won't cover 90% of the cost. I took a hot shower but that doesn't seem to have helped much.
