Feeling Like Others' Problems Are SillyMy trauma means that not only have I dealt with a lot of really, really hard stuff, but also that things continue to be hard in lots of ways that affect my basic needs and quality of life. At any given moment, I'm dealing with not only symptoms but also things like how I'm going to afford food, whether I'll have a safe place to live, etc.Lately a couple friends have come to me needing support because they're in unsatisfying relationships. And I've become really resentful of that, like "you know what I deal with, and yet you still come to me all desperate because a guy was distant to you last night? call me once you get a real problem." I haven't said anything like that yet but am afraid I will.Anybody else feel like this?
