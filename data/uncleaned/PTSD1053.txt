Hi everyone, I have been feeling the symptoms of PTSD for months now, and what's really hard about this battle is that i am alone and have no support. i have just moved to Puerto Rico and been here for like 7 months. i am from an Asian country, so I have no friends in here and I am depending on my husband for everything. I have been feeling really nervous for months now and it's very uncontrollable, and i just sometimes stare on the wall thinking about the problems that i have. I have plenty of problems regaridng my family back home, then someone was harassing me, threatening me, spreading rumors about me. Then, here, I don't have a job...and it's hard for me to get one because I don't speak the language. Everyday, i think about the problems and i always don't want to get left behind in this house. I always ask my husband to take me to work. I don't want to open up my problems with my husband because i dont want him to misunderstand me. He is the only person left here for me and if i lose him i probably will just want to die. i am suppressing my feelings and not letting everyone know. Everyday the symptoms are getting worse. I feel like im so exhausted, like i cannot breathe anymore...and my heart rate is so high. I dont know what to do. I want to have friends but i cannot find anyone.
