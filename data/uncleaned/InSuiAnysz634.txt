So with the risk of sounding simply like I'm seeking attention, I'm writing my goodbye. I won't be checking back here. I'm sorry for leaving some hanging in messages. My mind is messed up enough, I just need to get thru and end this without any more to think about and confuse my decisions. I have no doubt pushed myself into a corner I can't get out of. I don't want it any other way though. My despair is mixed with anticipation of an end soon. I can't put that anticipation into words because "relief" is not enough to describe it. Oh actually I can describe it, this scene from a movie Waterworld just poppped in my mind..if anyone saw it..it's the scene where the old man in a tiny row boat alone in the dark for years finally sees his imminent death and sighs, "Oh thank God."ÊAnyone thinking of suicide, again I urge go to counselling first. It won't stop your suicide plans if you should decide to go thru with them after counselling.Life can get better at any moment, swift or gradual, I realize that. I don't want to live any kind of life personally. My fears and panic about death are buried under this ache that promises an end.One last thing, because this place is the only place I have a voice, don't know how many actually will read this but anyway if you see anyone who's alone please just say hi to them. People saw me as a problem, as a trouble maker, while I grew up having sex with my father, they didn't bother to look past why I hung my head low or why I cut my classes in school or why I failed them or why I had no friends. They just saw me as a problem not what my problems were. Not every child can ask for help or thinks they even should ask.Goodbye.
