Single, Friendless and TerrifiedOk, so it's a dramatic heading but it's kinda how I'm feeling right now! I'm just two months out of 'THE' relationship (engaged, planned a family etc). My ex-fiance left the day after I joined a new company. All his friends were my friends which has now left me with a new job, no friends in Dublin and a terrifying realisation that all the plans I made with my ex will never happen.ÊMy close friends are living abroad and are now settled and starting to have children which leaves me with the task of making new friends in Dublin at the ripe age of 31!ÊI'm still reeling after my relationship and to be honest, I struggle to get through the day. My New Years eve plan involves ignoring it as much as possible!ÊAnyone in the same / similar position that can offer some sage advice please?Thankss
