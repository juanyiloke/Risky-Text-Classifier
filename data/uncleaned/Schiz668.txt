Êdemonsi need some real advice things arent going well im experiencing withdrawal from geodon either that or severe anxiety. i was switched to latuda recently and havent titrated up yet.there is a demon in me who thinks in my head and communicates in other ways like through feelings .it tells me im a liar and a fake but i know it is there.Êit was implanted by there by the creator to torment me. however i believe there is a legion of demons who watch me and torment on a daily basis. i see messages in songs, tv, billboards, graffiti, other people conversing, etc. i am being stalked and watched constantly. the meds just make me less knowing of this even though they barely help me at all! i dont think the world is even real. i dont know what to do. how can i protect myself? i dont feel safe around anyone. i dont belong
