Copycats(Mods feel free to move this post if it's in the wrong forum)This might seem like a stupid post but would be interested to hear your thoughts on this ladies or if any of you have had a similar experience.ÊDo any of you have friends who copy everything you do, say, wear? And I don't mean buying the same top once in a while.ÊThis is a friend (25) who Iv known since school, but it is getting to a point where it is starting to really bug me. I nearly feel I cannot do or have anything without seeing her a week or two later with the same! Other people have also started to notice. She is aware of this, as I have expressed some distaste about it. However, she laughs it off.ÊMaybe I sound ridiculous, but it is getting frustrating to the point that I feel like I am drifting away from her.ÊAny thoughts or advice? Tia
