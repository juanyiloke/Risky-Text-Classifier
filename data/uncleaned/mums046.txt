Dd is 6 months and has struggled with eczema since 3 months old. It starts out with small pimples under the skin which eventually turn into a red, weeping rash that mainly affects her cheeks with a few small patches on elbows and legs. She was ebf when the eczema first appeared but then I got appendicitis and peritonitis and had to stop breastfeeding for 3 weeks while in hospital for surgery and taking antibiotics. Once breastfeeding started again the eczema returned with a vengeance so its pretty obvious it was something in my diet causing it. I cut out gluten, caffeine and dairy and used Aveeno cream which managed to clear it up after about one week. I started slowly introducing foods again but after 2 months nothing happened so I assumed it was just a passing phase.Now at 6 months its back again and nothing seems to work. I have cut practically everything from my diet which is difficult as I'm still seriously underweight from the appendicitis. Could it be sugar causing it? I read that sugar doesn't pass into breastmilk but its the only thing left in my diet besides rice, beans and fruit and veg. Unfortunately I cannot take her for allergy testing as I live on a small island in Greece where its not available so have to rely on trial and error and Dr Google.ÊAnyone had success with curing eczema with diet? Or does eczema come and go and diet has nothing to do with it?
