Consultant appointment and CGMJust met the consultant at portsmouth. Lovely guy. Thanks northerner for suggesting I change to portsmouth. Well, I will be getting the pump. But first he wants to test out a few things. Firstly I have a constant glucose monitor for 2 weeks. Never had this before. Have any of you? He wants me to keep strict record. But he doesn't want me to change anything for the first week. In the second week he wants me to try and make my sugars the best I can from the information. He thinks my correction is way too high. He says he doesn't think the background Insulin is causing the mid morning Hypos. He also suspects I might be hypoing in the night. Could it be? Could I have been grossly misinformed on my SAILING course? They told me one unit to drop me one level but he says it's more like one unit to drop me three levels.
