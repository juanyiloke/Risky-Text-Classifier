ÊSymptomsDoes anyone who has recovered from the symptoms of the illness because of the medication they take fall into the same trap of thinking that there is nothing actually wrong with them? This is happening to me now. Although I have no plans to stop taking the medication because I don't want the symptoms to return and take any backwards steps, I actually feel the way I did years ago before I got sick (aside from my feelings surrounding the experience itself). I've heard that in some examples people may only have a few episodes in their life and make a full recovery, but i'm not sure if the people in those examples had continued to take medication or not.
