Do you tell others how they make you feel?by njohns321 » Fri Jun 05, 2015 4:55 pmI think I have traits of BPD, I just never express how I actually feel towards people. I'm super sensitive to everything people do. Like when people don't respond to messages right away it makes me either really angry or really depressed, like I'm a terrible person. I devalue people, I just don't tell them about it. I'm really jealous and possessive, I'm always paranoid about people leaving me, etc. I'm not overtly manipulative, but I'll tell people stuff like how I'm such an emotional wreck so that they'll feel bad for me and feel bad about leaving...So is there any way to change these feelings, or do you just not let it show?
