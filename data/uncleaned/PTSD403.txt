ÊMessy Memoriescont. Emotional DetachmentThis week, rough. I am having a lot of revelations post therapy that ended in early March this year. Messed up the actual therapy, shut down and lied my way through hated the whole experience. This is a pattern with me though.Very clearly, seeing it now. There has been a long history and my intentions are always to go beyond this frozen place and reclaim. At least today, it's apparent that the enemy is me...no kidding. I've been hearing it and unable to process beneath the "story." The retelling of the story only made it more confusing, disheartening, and disorienting. No body and no feelings, numb, exhausted, frustrated and frozen. Each time facing a loss, same thing, change, good or challenging same thing. Dreams, nightmares, meds, my disembodied state has existed for so very long. Push/Pull, this is existing, not living.This week I had not felt well at all, internally felt that a breakthrough took place, and I called the VA Thursday to see if they will see me again for more assistance. This time a female therapist would be a change and it will be one that I will request. Instincts are telling me that this is important and necessary. Beyond this?ÊOE any wise encouragement is sure welcome.Jade
