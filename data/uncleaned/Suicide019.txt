Failure.All my life, I have been treated differently, and I don't recall as to why. I'm just a ordinary teenager with ambitions and dreams. It has always been a dream of mine to join cheerleading, but I could never really try it out due to the money difficulties in my family. I decided last week that since my school was doing cheerleading tryouts, I'd just join just because. I won't let money stop me. So all week we would practice a dance routine and cheers and chants. Today was the official tryout, and there were 6 judges who were watching you and your group of 3. I was so nervous and I messed up a little. Later today, I received a call that I didn't make it. All of my friends had made it, all of my group made it. Almost everybody made the varsity squad, but I didn't. Even the girl in my group who I thought wasn't the greatest. I cried, I cried more than I have ever cried in my life. I was so upset, it hurts me to even type this. Nothing ever in my life has been happy and full of joy, I've dealt with more than you can imagine. I don't understand why things like this happen to me, I'm a failure. I'm not talented like everybody else. I'm terrible at absolutely everything. Today made me realize that dreams don't come true, that's only disillusionment. I'm not pretty or skinny, I'm just complete trash. I will never be able to achieve anything in life. I've tried so hard to never cut throughout my whole life, and today it started. Failure is all I am, and all I'll be.
