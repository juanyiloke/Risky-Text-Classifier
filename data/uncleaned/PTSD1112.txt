i have been looking for information regarding the connection with ptsd and chronic pain. i have been diagnosed with ptsd from a a car wreck that occured in march of 09. i substained several injuries. to mention four fractured ribs, a fractured collar bone and a possible fractured neck. i have most of the text book symptoms which includes frightening nightmares, intense anxiety attacks, uncontrolable anger at times, and i pretty much keep myself isolated at home and have lost contact with my friends. i understand that i have had time for my injurys to heal but i am still experiencing severe pain, even in parts of my body that werent injured during the wreck. i have been told two totally opposite things about this. one is that i must have a severe/chronic injury such as spinal damage to experience chronic pain with ptsd. the other thing i have been told is that with ptsd you do not have to experience any injuries to experience chronic pain if you have ptsd. matter of fact va.gov states that chronic pain can stem from ptsd caused by phsychological abuse. my phsyciatrist recommended that i see a pain specialist but after a few months the pain specialist said they were going to have to taper my meds down if i didnt get an mri and show that i have a serious back issue or some visible injury to look good for their paperwork. they said i must have a physical injury that would need chronic care. is this correct ? or do they not fully understand the correlation between ptsd and chronic pain ? i do know of a veteran that experienced ptsd from war and was given pain meds from the VA so im pretty confident that my dr. does not understand the relationship between the two. anyone have any ideas on how i could prove to my doctor that it is ok to treat me for this ? thank you
