Interview advice2012-03-20, 07:15 PMTeenager here,I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’m deciding to get a job during summer break at somewhere like Lowes or Home Depot. I had a part-time job last year, but is was simple work with my father being long time friends with the person who hired me. There wasn’t much of an interview then, but I know I’ll have to face one coming up. The reason for the job is to get some gas money saved up for my first truck. The other finances will be helped by my parents. I’m 16 at the moment and this is a big privilege seeing how I have been accepted to collegiate. That truck is my reward…I’m not nervous about the interview at all, but I would like some advice in what an employer looks for. I have heard when they ask “All right, any questions?” that it is important to have a comment or two to show that you engaged… and not just walking out saying “Nope… (derp)”. If you have any other suggestions or tips to help me look professional, I would appreciate it. Thanks.A wise man learns from his mistakes, but a wiser man learns from mistakes of others.
