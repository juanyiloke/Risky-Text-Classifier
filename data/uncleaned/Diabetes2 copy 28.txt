Am I prediabetic?  4  I'm new to all this. Over the last 17 days I have taken random readings using ACCU 'prick and touch' instrument. The average fasting time was 7 hours and the average blood glucose reading was 5.8 mmols/L (same as 104 mg/dL).  I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I'm inclined to 'eat when hungry and drink when dry'. I'm 12 stone 4 lbs and 5 feet 7 inches tall (or small - I'v shrunk) and I'm 81 years old. I'm not, and have nerver been, on a diet. Am I heading for Type 2? If so how can I avoid T2? Indeed, am I prediabetic?
