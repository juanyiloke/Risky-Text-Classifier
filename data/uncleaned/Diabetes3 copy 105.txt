Telephone Medication ScamA local elderly person had a phone call saying that the caller was from the local practice. They ask about their medication and then told them to start taking a new medication which cost £18 a month. When asked if the doctor was aware of the change, the caller advised to show their doctor at their next appointment, with that the patient realised it was a scam and hang up.The person then called the local practice and spoke to the practice manager who confirmed it was a scam, Is this going the rounds else where. Has anyone else heard of this.
