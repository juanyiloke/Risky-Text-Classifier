not sure if im in right areaby divefla » Wed Apr 22, 2015 1:47 amWTF is wrong with me or what going on ? About 2 yrs ago when I caught my wife having an affair in nj I went to my fla house to try to stem some of the tension and peacefully get divorced, when I confronted her at first she denied An denied the affair even though we planned a divorce , about 4-5 months in to her affair, about 2-3 months after i found out and right after i went to fla she then hurt our son by kicking, punching him , telling him he wasnt her son , because he got mad she was staying out for days on end,, she then called me in fla and told me to get our son out of nj and take him with me cause no son of hers was gonna tell her when she could come and go, so i asked if she was still seeing the boyfriend, she went off on me and ended with " im not gonna tell you again i dont have a ###$ boyfriend!" and hung up, so I then called her not-boyfriend after that and asked him to back off til our son left for school and we were divorced , i guess he called her and she knew the jig was up and that I not only knew for sure she was having an affair but who it was with, cause she then flipped out and sent the local fla pd to our house there wher I was, telling them i was dying and had a dead body in the house, she said she got a temp restraining order ie a TRO and for the next 6-8wks she threatened me with it, ( the worst i have ever done is tell her to go ###$ herself and say leave me alone, none of that in my mind would justify a TRO or FRO) she kept threatening me that if I didnt sign the divorce settlement that she an her atty prepared, she would press the TRO home to a final FRO and I would be sorry an I would be homeless and pennyless, I had no money for a lawyer cause by now she beat me to the banks and had cleaned them out, so i had to defend myself against the dv #######4, so short of it, she won, the judge said because i told one of her friends "mind your own business", (because she was telling my wife to turn off the cable, water, elec, an gas) that I was controlling, and further the judge reasoned that because I was angy about being dragged into court I must therefore be guilty of Domestic Violence, I honestly had no idea how easy these things where to get and that you need no real evidence whatsoever, so yall know acording to the court Im a mafia don and the president of an outlaw motorcycle club as well as a xmas tree murderer ,the complaint form was actually laughable the only true statement on it was my name and so-sec #, so she was right, she was able to make me homeless and pennyless, ,,so as soon as i was out of the house, she then killed my dog, looted the house w her not-boyfriend and moved out and in with him , meanwhile i was forced to live outside and in my truck. she then kept contacting me telling me if i wanted to go home all i had to do is sign what she wanted(In NJ the TRO's & FRO's state in bold prnt "Under no circumstances will the plaintiff be arrested for violating this order") so that is why I cant stop her from contacting me, unless i get my own wich i didnt want to do , I notice this getting long so ill try to make this shorter , any how this has been goin now for 22 months she has had me arrested twice, stolen my harley, stolen $120k in property , gotten power of atty over my signature, she cancelled the auto insurance leaving me driving for three months without any ins before i found out, she then tried selling my fl home out from under me , all this she got away with for awile because i hired a very bad atty who did nothing but take my money, also at one point i went before a judge and tried getting back into my home when i found out she moved in with her not-boyfriend, I told the judge she vacated the home and he asked how i knew she vacated it, i told him i downloaded my electric, gas and water bills and they were all zero for the past 4 months, he looked at me and said "how would you like to go to jail for stalking?" Any how thats the short version and now, i cant sleep, cant eat, my eye twitches, my rt arm trembles on and off , im diabetic now, i have high blood pressure now its been as high as 200 over 110 an im normally down near 120 over 80 , i feel like somethings always on my chest, i have dramatic mood swings from angry to sad, tears for no reason, i constantly pace back and fourth even when i talk to someone, i snap at people quickly, im constantly waiting for the police to arrest me, constantly looking for them to pull up, my heart races when one pulls in behind me when im driving or when i pass one on the road , i'm afraid to pick up the phone cause im afraid of what #######4 is this gonna be now?, im constantly worried, waiting and expecting for her to pull something new, because shes relentless. im afraid to go out because of this, i feel like im going insane, i cant take this #######4 anymore, a friend said what are you going to do if you have a heart attack or stroke? and my answer was, Ill finaly be happy that i wont have to deal with this #######4 any more!, WTF? this isnt right. I was never ever like this before.
