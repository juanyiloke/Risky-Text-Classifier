Purchasing a Used vehicle vs. New one2012-02-23, 08:44 PMHey there fellas. I have never bought a new vehicle for myself, ever. The first four were handed down by close family members. All have been very reliable cars that really lasted. Its my understanding,...from the word around me, that as soon as you drive off the lot with a brand new one,..it depreciates tremendously.ÊIs that pretty much true?ÊDoes anyone here swear by the CarMax dealership and have good fortune with that company and their reliable cars?What about the dealership that have the "Certified Pre-Owned" cars?ÊI guess I'm looking for a legitimate reason to stay with used, but since Ive never walked on a used car dealership, I don't really know what I'm walking into. And if the depreciation is that poor on new cars,..then used might the way to go??Anyway,..I appreciate any feedback you guys throw my way.
