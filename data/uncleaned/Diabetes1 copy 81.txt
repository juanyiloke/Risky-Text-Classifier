Swelling of feetI had been flying for about 8 hours in shoes/socks . After landing I noticed some signs of swelling of feet and clear marks of sock elastics on feet. I removed socks and without socks walked at the airport for about 3-4 hours in the shops to pass time for my connecting flight. after 6 hours of flying with no shoes on, I arrived home .I noticed that despite I was sitting in the aircraft without shoes on , I noticed swelling of both feet without any sign of injury, hurt etc on the skins.I want to relate this phenomenon with my T2 condition (currently a bit high readings 7.3 HbA1C) on March 20th . Can anybody share any similar experience with forum members?
