ÊPolice just left and I can't stop shakingThe police just left. I was in the backyard with my family and saw this guy walk past our fence and he was peering into the neighbors fence. He then started to break the fence. My daughter started to video tape the whole thing, she was only 5 ft. from the guy and he wasn't noticing us. But it freaked me out because I wanted to yell at my daughter this isn't a good idea, what if he has a gun?!!! But I was frozen.ÊSomehow I managed to call 911 and they looked for him but didn't catch him. I located the neighbor and they did a report.ÊWell I am just shaking, I hate having PTSD when something likes this happens because I feel so horrible with fear. I am already hypervigilant before this happened.I left my T an email to see if she has an opening before Friday.Ê
