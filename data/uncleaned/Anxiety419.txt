Everything I think seems realityWhen I go about my daily business, and I'm just thinking about random things, sometimes weird things pop in my head, like what if that headache is a tumor. This scares me for a few seconds, and than I'm like, nahh your making things up. One day I thought I was beginning to hallucinate, because I read something about schizophrenia and hallucinating. I became very afraid, that I was becoming crazy. I always think I'm seeing things in the corner of my eye. But it's always just a reflection or just something moving. But I seem to want confirmation that I'm not hallucinating, and when I am with friends and I hear a weird sound, I always ask my friends if they hear it too. The answer is 90% yes. But when I'm alone and I can't ask anyone if they heard or saw the same thing, I become afraid that I might be seeing things. Even though I'm 100% sure I'm not hallucinating.It seems that everything I think about is real, because I'm looking for a cause for my brain fog (or anxiety, I guess). And I can't seem to find one. I feel mentally tired at least once a day, which means that I can't put myself to do anything. This makes me enjoy things I used to enjoy a lot less. I've had this since February now, even did a blood test at the doctor, but that came out perfectly fine.Has anyone any idea how I can suppress or comfort my mind?Thank you in advance!
