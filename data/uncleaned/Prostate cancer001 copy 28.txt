re lost post Hi, I tried to post last Sunday (my first post)  even though I have been a member since early this year . I went to see my onco  on Monday this week  the first time since finishing my RT in Feb. and trying to find out from the site what to  expect next; I made my first post . At this point it may be a good time to say my computer skills leave something to be disired . Anyway as it to late for that ,it was good news ,my psa was down from 12.5 to 0.5 and dont have to go back untill next year (brill) just the dreaded psa test at GPS  in six mnths  time.                      Hope this gets on to post Stewart
