Fake ConversationsÊ  noomtack ,Ê22 Apr 2015I am just curious, does anybody waste a ridiculous amount of time acting out conversations with people that will never happen. Will you walk around your house/apartment or whatever and think about what you would say in a conversation that will never happen with someone that you might not have spoken with in years and will never see again. I do this all the time and it is such a stupid waste of time, I am just wondering if anybody else does this. Sometimes I will act out a conversation and what I would say, and the conversation does happen and I don't say what I acted out. I realize this is a huge waste of time and stupid and pointless, but I do it all the time, I just want to know if I am alone in this.
