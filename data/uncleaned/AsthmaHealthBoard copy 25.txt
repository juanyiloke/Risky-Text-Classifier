Chest tightness and effort to breathe with asthma________________________________________I am having a rough three months with asthma.I have been to the emerg 3 times and close to having to go to the hospital afew other times.I am almost off a tapered dose of prednisone but my lungs still do not feel good.I am on xolair injections 3 shots every 2 weeks, advair, alvesco, spiriva, atrovent when needed, rescue inhaler when needed, reactine when needed, Flonase and starting Zithromax today to try to ease the chest congestion three times a week.Just very exhausted and frustrated with my asthma lately.
