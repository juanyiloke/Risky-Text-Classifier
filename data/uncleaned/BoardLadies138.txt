Magazines - research for collegeHoping someone can help me. Looking for a magazine that mentions cosmetic surgery? (someone having had it, feature on it or lots of ads at the back). It is for a paper for college.I bought Glamour which is the bestselling UK mag and I remember years ago it containing loads of ads at the back but there was only one in it and no mention throughout the features of cosmetic surgery. Don't usually buy glossy magazines - am a house and home girl  so no idea where to start. I got funny looks at the local shop flicking through the mags so hopefully someone can steer me in the right direction. Thanks
