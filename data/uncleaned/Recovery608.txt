  Feeling Suicidal? Please read!I know what its like to feel a faliure and to want to take my own life. Just a couple of short weeks ago i stood thinking about suicide, close to making probably the worst choice i could have possible done. If you have not looked for proffesional help then you should do this now. I have and it has done me the world of good. Just 2 weeks later i have perked up quite alot but its not just because i am on medication but also because i have talked to people face to face about my problems. Letting things out helps alot. I have also had to help myself by taking walks, cutting down on smoking and staying away from booze. No one can really help us apart from ourselves and no one deserves to be left with the burden of our pain. You have to have hope and faith that you can lead a normal life. If you are suffering from long term depression you may have Dysthymia, a type of cronic long term depression that can easily be treated. There is no need to commit suicide, its not the way.
