 Do I need a dietition?HeyMy therapist told me she’d like me to see a dietitian.Only I’m not sure I really need it. I do some ED behaviours but I still eat enough most days and the behaviours are only there for a few days and then I have other behaviours. Different behaviours switch of and on. And I’ve only seen my therapist for 2 times now and have only really told her what went wrong. And I don’t want to waste people’s time by going to a dietitian when I don’t really need it.
