You guys help i'm so scared!!!!!!!Okay, so last night I had to go to Urgent care to get a note for work, and the lady took my temp with one of those under the tounge things. After that, it was all over for me. I'm SO SCARED that I might have contracted the stomach flu from it!!! I aske her if it was clean and she she said they were steril, but I'm still so scared. This morning I aw breakfast and my stomach gurgled I immediately got scared and have been scared ever since. I feel like I can't breathe and I have to drive to college still. I tried some grape juice and I thought it made me feel weird... but maybe it's anxiety that's making me feel weird. Long story short, how long would it take for the flu to stay showing symptoms? If I was gonna get it, do you think it would have happened by now? This happened at about 6 something last night maybe, so between the 8+ hours of sleep and the couple hours into this morning, and I safe??? Please and thank you in advance. I'm so scared, my brain is like 85% convinced I have the flu.
