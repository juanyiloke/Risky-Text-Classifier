I start a new job next week which means dd, 1yo, will have to go to nursery for one day a week (dh can look after her the other two days). Ds already attends and, whilst not mega happy, it's good enough. But I'm feeling really bad about leaving dd as she is very clingy and recently cries if I leave her side, let alone sight! The settling in sessions have been mixed and she tends to dissolve into floods when I pick her up after the hour. She tends to be a bit of a sensitive soul, not liking novel situations and unfamiliar people; she still screams if her grandparents pick her up  and will only settle for me... Has anyone got a positive experience of a sensitive child settling well at nursery?
