   Char12 , 27 Apr 2015So I'm 5,3 and around 132lbs. I'm aware this is quite heavy for my size but it's still within normal bmi. I'm in my final year of uni and for the past year I've been eating more unhealthy, mainly due to stress. I'm aware I have put weight on but it wasn't a major deal for me. I was planning on starting to be healthier anyway after uni. The past couple of months my mum has made indirect comments about me getting back down to a size 8 (I'm now a size 10 in some shops) and saying I can try and lose weight for my graduation. I'd said probably once or twice that I was going to try and lose weight and since then she's been relentless with it, trying to make out like it was all my idea to start with anyway. I brushed it off until the other day when she sat me down and told me ive put weight on and needed to lose it where I just burst out crying. I got the train straight away to my flat where she rang me a couple of times asking if I was okay. I couldn't stop crying the rest of the night and told her I was going to lose weight on my own and she needed to stop. It's been awkward between us since but getting better, until the other night when she randomly told me she had found a diet for me but had to start eating fish (I'm a vegetarian) and its just made me want to distance myself from her again.Because I can't lose weight overnight I now feel disgusted with my body and its made me feel depressed after eating anything. It's a vicious cycle of hating myself, eating and then hating myself more. The thought of her telling me I look good after I lose the weight annoys me too, like if it wasn't for her I'd still be fat. It's like conditional love. Does anybody have any advice on how to not feel awful until I lose the weight? Thanks
