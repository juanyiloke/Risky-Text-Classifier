Can I just ask those of you who have a child who has been diagnosed with autism or any other condition on the spectrum, at what age did you initially start to have concerns about your child's development?I only ask on behalf of a friend who in conversation talks about her DS (who will be two in July) and some of his behavioural traits that worry her but she won't seek advice as she thinks he's too young for the behaviours to actually mean anything and so no HCP will be interested.A colleague at work has a 12 year old DD who was diagnosed as having autism when she was six but my friend said in hindsight there were signs from a really young age that indicated that something just wasn't right.ÊAt what age should a 'parents intuition" be listened to and taken seriously even if that child is still quite young?ÊAny advice or thoughts really appreciated.
