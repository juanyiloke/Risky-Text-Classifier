the beautiful girlsFor those of you who would be considered beautiful (no modesty required), do you find your beauty affirmed on a regular basis.Now I know that everyone is beautiful to someone, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but there are some who are undoubtedly conventionally beautiful to the majority opinion. Would you fall within that category. And if so, has it been confirmed for you throughout your life i.e compliments from strangers, family, guys etc.It just seems that in modern society, beauty holds an undeniable advantage. I would have considered myself to be average to pretty enough at times. However I never seem to get approached on a night out, compliments etcIts a bitter pill to swallow if you are not so blessed as the beautifulSorry if that is a bit rambling, just on a downer ladies
