I'm in constant fight or flight response. Its causing nausea and sleep deprivation. My dreams are intense and I sleep maybe 4 to 5 hours a night. I wake up with butter flies all over my body. My adrenaline runs all the way out each day. I am hyper aware and everything is super bright. I'm in a daize half the time. When I try to go back to sleep my body sends a sharp butterfly sensation through my system which jerks me awake. As if its worried and doesn't wan't me to go to sleep. I'm irritable and scared. I have an intense head pressure from sensory overload that occured during the event. It feels as if my forehead is stuck. Like the muscles are sort of seized up. As if something needs to crunch out. Couple of questions...
