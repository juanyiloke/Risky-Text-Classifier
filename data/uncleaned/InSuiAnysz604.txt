I am a 67 yr old man who has had two heart surgeries and two heart attacks. It has been discovered that I have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that will need surgery but due to losing my job (because of applying for a medical leave) I'm now in bankruptcy and since I can't make the payments I'll be homeless in 30-45 days. No jobs have been forthcoming and I have made up my mind that ending my life at this point is the way to go. I have no family so there is really no one that will mourn so I have ordered helium and plan to take an anti nausea pill, several sleeping pills (retoril), several oxycodone 10/325's and put the bag over my head, tape it down and drift away. I'm putting it down here because I just needed to explain why. If I try to tell someone I know they always want to tell me all I have to live for but they don't understand that everything they are referring to will be gone within 90 days. I just don't see any other way out.
