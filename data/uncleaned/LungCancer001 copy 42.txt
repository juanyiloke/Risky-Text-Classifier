Crossing My Fingers Until Biopsy ResultsI posted this earlier but in the wrong place, I think. Sorry about that I'm new here and this is my beginning.I was diagnosed with a melanoma on my back in 2006. I was surgically removed. I had another melanoma on my scalp in 2013. Again it was removed with no further treatments necessary.A weeks ago, July 25, 2014, my pulmonologist called me while I was at another clinic at the VA Hospital. She wanted me in her office before I left the facility. I knew right away the news was not good. Long story short, I have a lesion right in the middle of my right lung. Along with my CT scan a few hours earlier and previous medical and family histories the doctor thinks it's a 90% chance it is cancerous. So far I am Crossing My Fingers Until Biopsy Results. I have a PET scan tomorrow morning that should help. My lab results also showed "markers" for malignancy (still not sure what that means). I've successfully been treated for two melanomas so I am thinking good thoughts about this. My biopsy is on August 20th, 2014. Left sided heart failure is on my agenda, too. At least I have plenty of testing to get done for that as well. Keeps me busy, right. Not really sure if this forum is appropriate for me or not yet. I am learning from reading everyone's posts. I hope it gives me help in making the decisions I will soon be faced with. Keeping a smile in my heart I am pleased to meet you all.
