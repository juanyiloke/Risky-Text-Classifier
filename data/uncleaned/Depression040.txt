I give up I now have decide to give up, no one cares. I took my pills today but I'm not tomorrow and if I'm good then I not going to take them, got the doctors on the 15th May, and will cancel as I don't think its helping. Do CBT online and phone calls, that is not helping, so will give up that. I am going to have to do it alone. I want to hide from everyone, I should be going to church tomorrow, but I will just head out with no one knowing where I am, just to sit with no one around me. I just have to do it, I not going to be a burden to anyone, so I'll just do things on my own. I don't expect people to answer so don't worry, I don't deserve anyone being nice, just had to get it off my chest. So don't reply and waste your time with me, seriously.
