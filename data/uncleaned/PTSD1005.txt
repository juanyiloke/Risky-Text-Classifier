I'm a former Army guy with several combat tours in several different countries. I served from 1999-2011. Without getting too graphic, I've seen lots of friends, civilians, and enemies killed. I've done my share of the killing, sometimes close up. I've talked to the VA about some of my experiences. I take medication for depression and anxiety, and I talk with friends who also have combat-related stress. But it's not helping. I wake up from nightmares a lot, some are flashbacks, some are events I wasn't even there for. I have flashbacks during the day sometimes. I can look at an Arabic person in the store, and because that person resembles someone I killed, I have a small panic attack. I've seen people who look like a friend who was killed in combat, and the same thing happens. This doesn't happen all the time, or even all that often; my wife has several Arabic friends that I talk with regularly. My wife told me that she found me in the garage one night, holding a bayonet and staring at the door. I didn't say anything, and when she tried to take it away, I didn't let her, but i just put it down. I don't remember this. I'm looking for better ways of getting control of this until we can switch my medication to something more effective. Any help is appreciated.
