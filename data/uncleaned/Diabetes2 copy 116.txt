During 2006 I experienced short periods of confusion, odd behaviour, later my doctor said that it was a hypo. I thought type IIs did not get hypos. My morning levels ranged from 6.9 to 7.9 however my recent hb1ac was 5.2. So I started measuring my sugar throughout the day. I found it to be very erratic. I also noticed that when I was exhausted it was high and when I was stressed I was low.I will have to look at my life style again.
