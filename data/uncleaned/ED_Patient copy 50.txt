Do I have an eating disorder? Please helpam a 21 year old female, I am 5'3 and weigh around 103-104lb (7 stone 5-6lb).I used to be just under 10 stone a few years ago and crash dieted to lose the weight. I wanted to be 9 stone, then 8 and a half, then 8, then I was happy bouncing between 7.10-7.12 for a few months. But recently it has dropped, I was fine at 7 and a half, but as it's gone down I've wanted it to stay down. I weigh myself everyday before eating/drinking. If my weight is at 7.5 I'm not too bad, but jf it js at 7.6 I panic that I'm getting fat and will keep gaining. I try not to eat until my evening meal, which I always make sure I havr, though sometimes end up snacking before if I start to feel too hungry. I have 2 cups of tea a day with 2 sugars in each to try and suppress my hunger. I also worry that when I start eating, I won't stop. Sometimes I will have a big takeaway, medium pizza all to myself, cobtinue eating it even if it hurts, and then half an hour after, continue eating. I never make myself sick/take laxitives and wouldn't, but I sometimes try not to eat all day in case I lose control and keep eating and eating. I have anxiety/depression/ocd ossues anyway and I'm worried I may have some sort of eating disorder too.Sorry if this is a lot of jumble, but any advice would be much appreciated, thanks.
