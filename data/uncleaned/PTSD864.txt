ÊIs there any relief?!Sorry, this is going to be a rant rather than a sensible advice seeking thread. Cue the endless profanities...I AM SO FUCKED OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY FUCKED OFF!I'm so SICK of the fucking trauma of it all. I am so SICK of it all being swept under the rug and the pretending that everything's ok, that nothing is wrong... it's fucking perverse, the way that nothing is acknowledged within my family.Since the incident last week, i've had nightmares. Every fucking night.Not only is that bastard affecting my waking life, he's affecting my dreams. There seems to be no escape and no relief. I am constantly being tortured.A lot of the time over the last couple of years i've been in serious shutdown mode and so I can't say i've fully felt the fear/anger/whatnot, but right now I am a nervous wreck - locking doors, jumping at the smallest sounds.I don't know how much more I can take. At this precise point in time, I am feeling like I really want to self-harm or "do something stupid". I just want a break from it all.I know this sudden wave of anger/impulsiveness has come from me just trying to call my parents but having him answer. I cannot stand the sound of his voice right now.I just feel like banging my head against a brick wall with frustration.ÊFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK - FUCKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS THIS I'M LIVING!?! FUCK!!!!
