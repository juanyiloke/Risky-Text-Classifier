ÊLowering SSRI...am I ready?I've been on different medications since I was a teenager. I've been dianosed with ADHD and depression, but about a year and a half ago after I "crashed", I was finally diagnosed with BPD. The man thing that tipped the psychiatrist off to it actually being BPD was that I kept having these "crashes" and would need to change medications.ÊSo, I've been doing DBT now since the diagnosis and am doing a lot better...but I still struggle. My work is emotionally stressful as I am an Employment Counsellor. I have had insomnia since I was in my early teens, so I am tired a lot-which increases my irritability. I don't feel depressed anymore really-but I do get really irritable and stressed out.ÊSo, now I am tapering down my Zoloft. I have gone off numerous anti-depressants-so I've been through this so many times. Today I was quite dizzy. I'm just scared now of getting really angry and irritated. My job requirese to be on the ball all of the time emotionally.ÊI'm looking forward to the medication side effects going away-to being able to loose some weight and get rid of the sexual side effects. I guess now I have the DBT skills to get me through it. I guess we will see what happens.
