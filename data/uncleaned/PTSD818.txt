ÊTired.......I'm sick of feeling lie the way I do, everyday is a battle and I just don't feel safe anywhere. I feel like I've nowhere I can go, nobody I can turn to that understands. Being out in the big wide world on my own scares me to death and I'm sure I'm being followed again.My girlfriend keeps pushing me to work but I've tried for so long to work with people and it's just too stressful. Tried a job working by myself, part time for 5 weeks but that just gives me time on my own to think and all I can think about is the past!Coming to terms with mum and dad abusing me as a child, so can't turn to them. My girlfriend pushing me into work, I'm sure she doesn't understand and I've no friends to talk to.The stress is just too much for me at the minute, I just want it all to stop! I'm close to rock bottom and have been there before and it's not a nice place to be. What do I do???
