Do you have a 60th wedding anniversary coming up?I have just been told that HM the Queen will send a card for a 60th  Diamond Wedding anniversary celebration, I just thought it was for 100th birthdays.   Then on checking the royal.gov.uk website along with the things they need to apply for this I found that you can also buy a special bespoke made frame from a company website called royalimages.co.uk on the net.  My friend has her grandmothers 100th birthday card and she ordered a frame even though she sadly lost her grandma so she has it hung on her wall in memory.  Well worth a look, so excited needed to share it.
