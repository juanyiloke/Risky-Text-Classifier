Hi, i'm new to the group...i've had asthma since 2004, allergies all my life.. i just got out of a women's Domestic Violence shelter and i'm staying in a motel...which i was told was "clean, well kept""...well, not clean enough!! When i was resting last night, the neighbor was burning incense...that started it all... This morning, i woke up stuffed up, wheezing, coughing...it scared me! i haven't had an attack like this in quite a while...had to immediately grab the inhaler and take a double dose of my allergy meds...i've had to use my inhaler 4 times today. Went out and bought a nice vacuum...my god, i couldn't believe the crap i pulled out of this nasty ass carpet...i saved it to show the manager...its ridiculous...i don't know what the housekeeping staff does when they clean!!! Nothing??? Anyways, it was just a yucky, sickly day...thanks for being here and for listening.
