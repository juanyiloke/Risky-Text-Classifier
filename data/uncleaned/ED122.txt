Struggling with eatingIam a 54 year old woman. I just lost my brother last year. I've been grieving now for a while. I lost my appetite 6 mos ago. I went to my doctor but she told me I did not have an eating disorder but I know I do. I know it. I had a therapist but he just dismissed it. He said it was a controll issue. But it still did not help me. I have tried to talk to people but they don't seem to listen or understand what i am trying to say. This is what I have been through the past several months. Is any one having the same problem I am having. I sometime pass out. Im weak and tired.
