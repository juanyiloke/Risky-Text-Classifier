The demise of the bee.Yesterday the frightening headline came on our local news that 30% of bee hives "died" last year. Urgent investigation by two scientific bodies have indicated that this sudden sharp decline is probably linked to a new generation of nerve-agent pesticides our dear farmers sprayed all over the country.Is it coincidence that about 30% of British cropland Ð 3.14 million acres Ð was being treated with the chemicals in 2010 and now 30% of hives have died?.When will our farming community learn that without bees no amount of pesticides will give increased crop production, eradicating insects will eradicate crops! Without bees, and other insect pollinators, including the Bumble bee, there will be no crops as just about everything relies on pollination for its reproduction.
