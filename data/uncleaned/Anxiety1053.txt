Please helpHi,I can't remember the last time my anxiety was this bad, it's making me so irritable as well, and short tempered, and I can't tell my family what's going on. It sounds so stupid, but lately I've been hit by the crippling fear that my family are going to die, if they're out ill message them asking stupid questions just to check they're still alive, I worry all the time that they're going to be in a car crash, or in a fire, or taken hostage, that the metro/subway will get bombed when my dad is on his way to work... The. Tonight they said that for New Years they'll be going into the city (I live in Paris, France), and I'm petrified that they're going to be victims of a terrorist shooting or bombing and AHHHH I JUST CAN'T DO THIS THE ANXIETY IS SO BAD! I miss having a therapist , I'm all on my own now
