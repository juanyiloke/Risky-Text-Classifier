Squeak Bum Time Over Again... Hello Everyone,Just a quicky to let you all know that today I had my 4 monthly review and PSA results...I'm happy to report that once again my PSA levels were <0.01 ( undetectable ) No further treatment is required at present.A further review and PSA result is scheduled for approx 4 months time...Not sure why, but this time I was more nervous than before.... I thought it would be getting easier...Being a 'doom and gloom' merchant I suppose the longer I go on getting good results the more I'm going to find myself worrying?Best Wishes to you allLutherDecember 2014 Squeaky Bum Club Hello everyone,Just a quick note to say today ( 05-12-2014 ) I've attended my 2nd post op review....I'm delighted to say that my PSA remains at < 0.01 ( undetectable )Consultant is very happy with the way things are going so far.....so very encouraging....... another review and PSA test is scheduled for 4 months time....Phew!......
