Has any else had trouble with their sharps bin collection ?When I need my needles collected I ring the waste department at my local council and arrange for them to pick them up, the needle collection company come past my area every Tuesday so Tuesday is always the day for needle collection.I leave my needle outside my front door and in the afternoon the old needle box has gone and been replaced for a new one, but this time no one came to collect my box I've phoned the waste department and spoke to them and it is under investigation as to why it wasn't collected even though the men collecting my box had logged that they collected it?! It's now been nearly 3 weeks and still no one has came out to collect it and my needles I've used since I'm just putting in a cup onto of my fridge as I have no where else to them, my partner phoned this morning to put in a compliant and to ask why no one has been round to collect them yet, the man at the other end of the phone was very rude and said there's nothing he can do and that it was still under investigation?! I'm so angry at the fact the people who collect the needles came past where I live every Tuesday and can't collect my old box is something I don't understand, and I live in a flat so my needles are left outside my front door in the communal hall everyone is very understanding but there are young children who also live in my block and I myself have a 3 year old son surely it's a risk having the needles laying around? I make sure they are out of his reach but still it's not on! Has any else had this problem? And has anyone got any advise?
