Australian ABC on Low CarbThis Catalyst half-hour programme "Low Carb Diet Fat or Fiction" is being repeated today at 11:30 am (2 1/2 hours from now) on ABC1. I only caught the tail of it earlier this week and will be recording it. The transcript is worth reading. Try to ignore the predictable pompous nonsense from the dietician. The rest, including the endo, are very interesting comments.http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/4126228.htmI realise most of the people on this forum will be asleep then, but hopefully the video link will work by your morning (404 at the moment).
