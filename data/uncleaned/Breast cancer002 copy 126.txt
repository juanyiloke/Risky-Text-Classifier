Can I change the frequency of my Chemo?¥	I currently have Chemo every 3 weeks and I've just finished my third session. I know everyone suffers to some extent afterwards, but I don't feel I can cope with the side effects any longer.¥	I have an appointment with my Oncologist on 21st April and I'm seriously considering asking her if I can stop at the 3 sessions, or if she'll put me on weekly sessions, assuming, that because of the lesser dose, the side effects will be less.¥	Has anyone else on here managed to changed the frequency of their treatment and did it help any?¥	Thanks for reading and your comments welcomed,¥	Jeanette X
