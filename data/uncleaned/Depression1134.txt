Why now?I'm sitting on the couch at midnight, sobbing. Why does this hit with no warning? My daughter is home from boarding school, my family are all well, safe. There is no reason to feel this way. It is so frustrating! This year I have had to resign from work due to anxiety and depression. For several weeks now it has felt like a huge weight has been lifted, and I was actually happy. Then tonight it feels like I am suffocating and I don't know why. I have read a lot of others' thoughts, things to try, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I also feel ridiculous writing this, looking for what? I'm not sure, just a need to know that it affects others in the same way I suppose, that I'm not going crazy. I'm sitting here hoping my husband doesn't wake up because he won't know what to do or say, how to make it better, and then he will feel bad too.
