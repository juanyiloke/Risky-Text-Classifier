Metformin Trouble after 4 years?Hello forum.I've been taking metformin for about 4 years following T2 diagnosis. Initially 3 x 500mg daily, reduced about a year ago to 2 x 500mg daily.My latest blood test showed HbA1c at 5.4%, which I like. Started out at over 9%.HOWEVER...When I first started with the metformin I had stomach troubles - cramps, feeling bloated, wind, diarrhoea, etc. It cleared up after about 6 weeks though - but in the last 3 months or so I've started suffering from very similar symptoms again. It's now every bit as bad as it was in 2011, and pretty debilitating - there are days when I can barely do anything, such is the discomfort.I noticed it first when I was on holiday in Thailand in January, so I assumed I'd picked up a nasty bug. However, when I got home, my hospital took some samples which they said were normal - nothing untoward. And yet the stomach upset hasn't gone away and is still giving me trouble more than 2 months later.Can this sort of thing flare up after this length of time, or should I look for another cause?Appointment with GP booked but he's not available until next week. Wondered if anyone had any thoughts/advice in the mean time.Tempted to drop down to 1 x 500mg daily, or maybe stop altogether just for a few days, to see if it helps.I gather there's a slow release formulation which can sometimes help with this. May ask GP about this next week.Grateful for any assistance...Thanks,Alan.
