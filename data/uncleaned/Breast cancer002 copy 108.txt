What a difference a week makes!¥	Hi all, hope your Sunday has been as awesome as mine. Nothing spectacular just normal. We went to see my brother in law for in first time since Christmas, followed by seeing my brother and nearly sister in law. Just had roast salmnon, potatoes and roasted tomatoes and peppers. This s was followed by a lovely blue cheese and washed down with a lovely rose wine. The best bit was that I can taste everything. My last chemo was 5 weeks ago tomorrow. So to all of you who have just lost or are losing your sense of taste, there is hope although sometimes is doesn't feel like it at the time.
