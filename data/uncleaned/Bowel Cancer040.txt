Peritoneal Mets - hope for patientsHi allI just wanted to post this to give hope to people with mets in the peritoneum.When my partner Dave had his initial bowel resection the surgeon noticed what she called a small spot in the peritoneum. She didn't remove it because of its proximity to the blood supply of his kidney. A PET scan unfortunately showed up two more areas.There wasn't a lot of information about peritoneal mets on this site, so I did my own research which mostly worried me - I know, don't consult Dr Google. Dave's oncologist also told us that chemotherapy isn't always that effective with this type of spread. Before Dave's liver resection yesterday, they inserted a camera to check for mets in the peritoneum - as this would have meant the resection couldn't happen. They could find no evidence - how amazing is that?So the point I am making - don't give up hope, chemotherapy can batter these type of mets.Debbie
