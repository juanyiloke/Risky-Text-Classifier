  Unhappy Waitress________________________________________Hi, posting here as just wanted to get a few opinions about what I should do about work. I work as waitress and I know there are a lot of things in this particular area that are deemed as normal but I'm starting to find it really tough.I've never received a payslip in the 3 years I work there, get paid in cash and sometimes have to ask reapeatedly for them, recently it went on for weeks looking for wages for a particular week. Calling in repeatedly and they werent there for me. They are very often wrong etc and have to figure that out yourself as we dont get payslips and tips are put in same envelope. We used to get breaks but we dont any more which I know is very common in hospitality but a few weeks ago when the owner over heard me saying I was going for a cigarette, she snapped in front of customers that "I dont pay you to smoke" this was 6.5 hours into a busy shift and as one of the customers happened to be my boyfirneds friend, I found it pretty humiliating but I said nothing as I find it hard to stand up for myself. It is quite common that she as snapped at us in front of customers. The chefs get very heated during work hours, throwing plates and cursing at you etc if you ask a simple question. Saying its your fault when they make a mistake and so on. We are always told to let it go over our heads.A couple of months ago, a customer grabbed my bum. It was kind of laughed off my colleagues and employers but I found it very upsetting and I feel sick even writing it now. I would be considered attractive enough and now ever since, if any customer makes any flirtatious banter with me I feel anxious and upset where as before I might have laughed it off.The other owner called me a ride during work hours after he'd had a few drinks and his wife overheard and made him apologise to me, after she left he jokingly said he was sorry about that earlier again but that "we would ride one day", I think I was in shock and as I'm not a confrontational person I laughed it off and said nothing, when he repeated it I got up and said I was going for a cigarette and then I called a taxi home. I know a couple of the others working there are unhappy also but in the last couple months, I have had a lot of anxiety about anything relating work. I get very anxious before going in and a few times have even felt as if I was having a panic attack. I ask my partner to go down and collect my wages during the week sometimes as I cant face going in unless I really have to for work. If I get a text from them I feel my heart pounding. I cant go on like this.I cant just leave as I have a child to support and rent to pay. This has really pushed me to become more qualified and I returning to college in September to get a degree. I'm just wondering what I should do in mean time. My family have urged me to go to doctor to get a sick certificate etc. Any advice or opinions would be really great.
