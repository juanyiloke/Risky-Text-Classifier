Has anyone had any luck with the Paleo diet?Since I've only recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I'm hoping I can beat this thing with proper nutrition. Someone at work told me she's on the Paleo diet and her blood sugar has never been better. I'm not too familiar with the plan, I was hoping someone might be able to fill me in. Anyone on it now? Is it working for your diabetes? Do you think if I eat a very low-carb diet, I can stop taking insulin eventually? My doctor says as long as I use fast-acting insulin, I can eat anything I want; but from what I've seen on some boards, that doesn't seem right. I'm confused!
