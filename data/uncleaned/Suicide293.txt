CuriousI'm curious. For the first time, I am having suicidal thoughts: I feel worthless and wish I were dead. I know I don't want to carry these thoughts out, I know I have friends and family who love me, and I know I will feel better in some time, despite how I currently feel. For the last few years, I've gone through stages where I would say I've 'struggled to cope' with life, but I've always gotten through it and been okay again. I don't have any sort of physical reason for this, or terrible traumatic event, or anything, just periods of depression/panic triggered by various really stupid things that I really feel I should be able to cope with better - that at different times, I know I would be able to cope with better. But this is the first time I've felt this bad, ever actually just wanted it to stop. Obviously it's not the kind of thing I want to just drop into conversation, but I don't know, I've just been looking on the forum for people similar, just to get the feeling it's not just me, I don't know. I feel like I should have a reason for feeling this way. Does anyone have any similar past experiences?
