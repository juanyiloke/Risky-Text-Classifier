ÊAre these voices because of BPD?I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a long time ago when I was 14. I used to have only one voice then and he is nice but when I was 28, I started getting other voices. I have 3 that talk to each other. Two women and a man. They talk about every single thing I'm doing, and I hate it. They aren't saying it in a nice way, it's horrible. They talk to each other about how I look and say really awful things.ÊI've never told the psychiatrist or my GP about them before because a mental health nurse told me that doctors don't like to hear that. She said that everyone has voices that like but they don't talk about it. I used to believe that but now I know that not everyone does. But does everyone who has borderline personality get voices like those?
