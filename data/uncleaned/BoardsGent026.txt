Gender Reversal. Does it work?Listening to George Hook drone on yesterday evening about a feminist group who were trying to promote gender reversal on popular TV shows. Female spy's, female action heroes etc etc. There were a few texts asking questions like what would happen if the likes of the little mermaid was remade with a boy instead of the girl and of course George went off into a tangent and asked what would have happened if Pamela Anderson's character in Baywatch was recast as a man. He completely missed the point that in Baywatch there was eye candy for both sexes!But anyway, do you think gender reversed roles on popular TV shows or movies would work? I'm of the opinion that 90%+ of the time they wouldn't. They're popular for a reason, and changing them just wouldn't have the same outcome.
