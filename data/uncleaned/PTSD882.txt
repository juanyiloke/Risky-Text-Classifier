ÊPtsd isnt just for war vetsHey guys,ÊOk so ive been talking to my councellor about me maybe having a type of ptsd.ÊBefore i was a farmer and a family man i had a shady life where i was homless for close to 10 years. During that time i saw and experienced alot of traumatic things. It was totally normal to see alot of violence like stabbings and beatings as well as overdoses and even murders. as i moved farther away from that life style and " cleaned myself up" i started to be haunted by the memories of the things i witnessed. Being a homless kid meant you were at the mercy of the streets and when bad things happened you just were thankful it didnt happen to you. And sometimes it did. I was desensitized to violence and didnt even feel anything at the sight of blood. But now i have nightmeres of needing to kill people in self defence. Or memories that replay over and over of things that were NOT ok. Very disturbing things. How do people cope with this? I feel like i am a sort if war vet in my own way. Any ways to push the memories back? What helps?
