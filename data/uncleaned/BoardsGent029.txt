Anyone have advice on growing my hair out?I've grown sick of the old reliable short back and sides since I've had it for years at this point. I've decided to grow my hair out. Currently my hair is about 2-2.5 inches on the top and roughly an inch on the sides, maybe a little less. I plan on growing my hair out until the top gets to about 5 inches and go from there. My last haircut was about 2 months ago, so I figure I'm due a haircut now, since it's starting to look quite messy. Though, I've never gotten a haircut while growing my hair out before, the only other time I ever grew my hair out, I just let it grow for a few months and didn't care how messy it got. Does anyone know what I should ask for when getting a haircut? I figure I should just ask the barber to tidy everything up, neck hairs, the hair around the ears, the locks and such, I was also going to ask him to blend the sides into the top, which I'm unsure about, would this cause it to look weird once it's grown out? Or would that be fine?
