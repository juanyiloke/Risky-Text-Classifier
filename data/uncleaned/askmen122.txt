advice for relocating to a new state2012-03-23, 06:44 PMI am giving serious consideration to moving to a new state and wanted to find out from others who have done it how they went about it.I am a lifelong resident of NJ (42 yrs) and have been thinking about my future.I don't want to continue to live in a state like NJ that has an extremely high cost of living. I don't want to struggle in my retirement, either.Êso I am wondering what is the best way to go about finding a job in another state and moving.I have a college degree, but I don't have any "specialized" skills (I work for an insurance company).my concern is that if I send a resume to an employer in say, tennessee, it will automatically be dismissed because I am not a local. I don't have any special skills that would make me a shoe-in, and any employer would pick a local over me.obviously it would help to move to tennessee first, and have a local address, but I can't do that without getting a job first. catch-22, it seems.any advice from anyone who has moved from one state to another? how did you go about it?Êthanks,
