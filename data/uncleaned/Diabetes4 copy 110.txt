help please - how to tell mrsHiWell its been a while me posting hereright the help  I need is How do  I explain the urgency/ need to change my way of eating to my wifeShe does most of the cooking and so food that I may need to reduce or cut out I am still having. I know that maybe I should take over the cooking more but am not a confident cook and so go along with whatever is put in front of me.I lack determination and will power really and that's issues I need to work on.I also will eat foodstuff that she will not eg some veggies so in those instances do cook them myself.
