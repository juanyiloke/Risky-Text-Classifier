Cancer, Not Smoking & BG level.This is following on from a post in "Off the Subject" re No Smoking Zone. I stopped smoking on 26 Jan after I went in to hospital for a Biopsy. I was discharged on the 28th. I was given the result on FRIDAY 13 FEB, positive for Bladder Cancer. I was given no additional medication but told to carry on with what I'm taking for my Heart, Sciatica and Diabetes. My diet hasn't changed but I admit I'm not eating anything like before the Biopsy.Since the 26th I've lost 1st 4lbs, now weigh in at 25st 4lb so a long way to go, my sense of smell and taste have improved and my BS's are now running between 5 and 8 when before the were anything from 8 to 11. There was even a discussion with the DSN about going on to insulin.So my Cancer has given me better control of my BS level!
