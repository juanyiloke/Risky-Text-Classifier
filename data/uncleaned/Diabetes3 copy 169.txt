Hi, my weight was not moving as fast as I would have liked, so, with an appointment coming up, and wanting to regain my pre- Christmas weight, I thought I'd try no/low carb. I started yesterday and felt terrible. Woozy headed etc. I sort of expected that, but had a couple of oat biscuits to offset the worst symptoms and felt better. I remained carb free/low for the rest of the day. During the night I couldn't sleep much. Too alert. I was also hungry, so got up around 4ish and had two oat biscuits and some milk. This morning my BG was 4.9. It has been in the 6.+ regions. My question is, is it possible to say whether that's because I was eating carb low for the day, or because I ate during the night which prevented the dawn phenomena? I know it's probably not possible to tell for sure, but I'd appreciate any comments. Many thanks.Teadance
