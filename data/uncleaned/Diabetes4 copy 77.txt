Overnight lowsso recently I've been having lows overnight. I had one last week which lasted about four hours or so and I reduced my basal by 10% following that. Now Wednesday night I was low 11pm-4am. I assumed it was that I had mixed up bolus and basal. But perhaps I was wrong. My Libre shows that last night I was again low for at least 2 hours. Haven't yet downloaded it to see how long. I don't wake up feeling low at all. I either don't wake up or have woken up for an unrelated reason such as needing the toilet. I've rules out possibility of libre being wrong as my current sensor has been spot on all other readings. And the other night I scanned whilst lying down in bed under the duvet. Libre said 3.4. I told it that it must be wrong as I felt fine. Got up and tested and bg was 3.4. Obviously the solution is reduce basal again. By another 10%. Which I will do tonight. But I have a few questions. Shouldn't I wake up if I am low overnight? Or have the same symptoms I have during the day? I feel fine if I do wake up. Shouldn't my liver fix these lows if I haven't fixed them? They last for 2+ hours overnight. I thought liver would kick in straight away?I'm sure I've always thought that after a liver dump bg would shoot up high? My bg goes up eventually after a few hours. Which must mean that it was liver that put out sugar to fix it because it wasn't me eating any as I was asleep. If it's liver dump then why is just a little slow crawl to the right side of 4? I thought liver dumps make you shoot up high.
