Enzalutamide side effects I'm now into my seventh week on Enzo. Around the end of week 4 I started to suffer from constipation. I checked the leaflet that came with the Enzo and there is no mention of this being a side effect of Enzo. I did some internet searches and found the US version of the same leaflet produced by the manufacturer. This said constipation was a side effect of Enzo. I also found other US studies that indicated 1 person in 4 experienced constipation as a result of taking Enzo. So, there's a discrepancy between UK published side effects of Enzo and US published side effects.Now I know us Brits sometimes think our cousins are full of **** but I think that's taking possible explanations a little too far. ;-)It would be very helpful to me prior to talking to my Onco to know whether others have experienced the same problems as me. Therefore, if you are currently taking Enzo or have previously taken Enzo I would be grateful if you could say whether or not you suffered from constipation shortly after commencing treatment.There may be other side effects of Enzo that others have experienced where they would like to know if others have/have not suffered the same. Please feel free to add any such questions to this thread.Many thanks in advance for your replies.
