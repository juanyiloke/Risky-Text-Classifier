"Healthy" = UNHEALTHY!I lost a lot of weight 1.5 years ago on the raw food diet, and was hospitalized for my low heart rate (44bpm resting) and low weight (14 years old, 80 lbs, 5'2" . Now I'm pretty much back at that same weight and heart rate, and am about to be hospitalized. However, I did some research, and in the raw vegan community many people say that the standards for what is a "healthy" weight are totally messed up! What's considered a healthy weight by doctors is actually overweight! I feel like I'm being forced to gain weight that I don't need! Please help! And another thing... the whole "menstruation" thing... I heard that it's totally unnatural for women to menstruate! And even if it is natural, maybe it's just not "my time" yet...but the doctors say it's because of low weight...but I'm not so sure!
