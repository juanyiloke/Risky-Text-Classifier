How long do most people think about suicide?KongI am 26 now. I can remember as early as age 11 wanting to kill myself. I’ve seen some shit, been through shit, who hasn’t? Wanting to call myself is what I call depression. I tell people all the time I’m depressed, most of the times they seem to care, do they realize that I am saying “I want to kill myself” in different words? The last three months I’ve really been thinking about taking my life. Down to every detail…..to keep the rambling to a minimum, is it typical for people to feel like this for so long?….~fear of failure….
