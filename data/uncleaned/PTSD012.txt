IrritatedSo, I posted on a separate social media site an image aboutPTSDÊwhich included some of the symptoms we deal with and it said something along the lines of have patience with us, we don't enjoy this struggle anymore than others like to watch us struggle.Very quickly I got many comments such as "we all deal with shit, ppl need to cowboy up and get over themselves" and "ptsd is just a made up disorder for weak people" ... and it goes on.ÊWhich of course made me mad because I don't at all think of myself as weak or using my past as an excuse to collect social security checks. I hold a 40 hr a week job and I am married with several sons. I don't think I'm weak at all, I just struggle more than most people with my brain and flashbacks. Ugh.Ok, I just needed to vent. I feel better now.
