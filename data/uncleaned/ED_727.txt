Bulimia - so out of controlHiIt's taking me a lot to write this because I speak to a few people via chat in the community and this is something I am deadly ashamed about I dont talk about it.Today the drains have just been unblocked due to my excessive purging of food. I feel so out of control of my life I cant believe it has come to this. I've tried self help books, mindfulness and distress tolerance skills to ride the urge to binge but none of it is working.I have told my cpn about the bulimia but she hadn't suggested anything or referring me to see anyone more specialist. I think it's because I'm am not underweight or had any physical complications from it.I don't know what to do aanymore, I've tried regular structured eating and that hasn't helped either. I feel so consumed by this I feel desperately lost alone and suicidal.Please help someone.
