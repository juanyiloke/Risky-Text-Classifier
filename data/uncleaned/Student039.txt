 How can one survive from a part time job ?by ahmshereHello everyone , I intend to study in the UK but I am afraid that my part time job won't be enough to make a living .. With my budget of 3000 pounds I have planned to support myself until I get a part time job but ...My parents do not have the financial resources to support me during my studies so I really don't know what to do ... part time job seems to be my only option in order to survive there and finish the university.. yet, the salary will be enough to make a living ? Is anyone living from a part time job ?Is college the way for a mediocre life?by ahmshereHello everyone, I hope you will have the patience to read about my beliefs about college and career and try to help me to solve my biggest dillema : the question from the title. My dream is to have my own restaurant , financial freedom and enough money to travel around the world , but I don't know if college is the proper way for acomplishing this. I tried to focus on poker beacuse there are no limits. One can win at poker in just one night the money that another person would work for an entire year . But because of the greed , I've always lost my winnings at the same game, at the same place, to the same guys. If I will go to college , whatever I choose , my life will be full of limitations, taxes , fixed schedules all of those guarenteed ... While my dreams will get far away from me..I will work like a slave making others get righ while I become poorer. Aslo there are a lot of succesful people , highschool dropouts , who went beyond the limits that school offers and followed their dreams. I really don't know what path to choose , just tell me what do you believe , is college worth it ?
