Chromium Complex and Cinnamon supplementsDo any of you peeps take Chromium Complex and/or Cinnamon supplements?  I started to take them when first diagnosed in March and did drop 8 points when I had my first 3 monthly HbA1c test, but, I also started following a low carb diet!  I stopped taking the Chromium Complex in July and have now run out of cinnamon supplements and am uncertain whether or not they aided my lower readings or whether they would have fallen anyway.  My October HbA1c was only 2 points down on last time after I ceased taking Chromium Complex.  It is a difficult thing to measure as to whether these supplements are of any help.  What are your views please and for those of you that are or have taken them, did you think they made a difference to your HbA1c?
