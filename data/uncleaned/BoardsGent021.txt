Skin , diet and looking youngHi,30 year old male, fairly unhealthy diet - sugar and fat, don’t drink. Anyway ran into an old friend, she is few years older and has plenty stress in her own life - yet she looks as young as the day I met her first ( 10 years ago ).Basically can someone give me motivation, or re assure me that cleaning up my diet and engaging in exercise and over all better living it will result in an improved skin tone ( if that's the right word ? ), basically just make me look less old - I know I cant be 20 again but just something. Have some crease lines in forehead and look a little chubby and greasy face wise.Just want to hear that exercise has visible benefits, and give me some confidence in chatting to girls.
