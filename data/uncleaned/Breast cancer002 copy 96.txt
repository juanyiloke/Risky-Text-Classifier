Back problems after LD flap reconstruction¥	My wife had an LD flap reconstruction at the time of her mastectomy 4.5 years ago, and ever since has had what amounts to a weak back.  She is 57 now, and pre-cancer was very fit.¥	The weakness in her back seems to be down to the obvious imbalance between the muscles due to the absence of her LD on one side.  She's now 18 months into a program of physio and Pilates which is very slowly improving matters, but she still feels that she has a long way to go to get where she wants to be.¥	That's the background, so now to my questions.  Are we alone in thinking that when we were told before the op that she would really only notice a difference in the strength of her back and shoulders after the reconstruction if she was a very keen swimmer or tennis player, that was not quite the whole story?¥	And following on from this, did other ladies here who've had LD flap reconstructions do a program of exercises or have physio sessions afterwards to help regain their strength?
