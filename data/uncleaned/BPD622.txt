I Have Borderline Personality DisorderOne of the things that bothers me the most is that now that I know I have BPD, I blame almost everything on this disorder. But it shouldn't be like that. I'm just tired of walking around, feeling dead on the inside, that I can't bother doing stuff anymore. Even the smallest things require so much energy and the harder stuff turns me into a sobbing crazy uncontrollable *****.ÊWhat this "disorder" has taught me though, is to understand others better. After reading a book called "how to love someone with borderline personality disorder" I started seeing other people's perspective. After reading that book I actually thought that half my friends have BPD. But I guess I just learned what kinds of personalities others have. That they might misinterpret stuff too. And that I sometimes read WAY too much into situations.ÊIt's hard. I have so many delusions and I can't figure out how to change my whole thought pattern, when the amount problems seem unbearable. I truly think everyone hates me, which I read from their body language. When someone laughs behind me, I get paranoid and think that they're laughing at me. If I'm told something positive about myself, I think I'm being lied to. I have so much mistrust in people, and I can't connect with anyone. Every time I'm out I feel like I'm holding my breath, and that I can't relax. All this anxiety, paranoia, delusions and worst of all depression, is killing me.ÊIt's no wonder that I keep looking for drugs, alcohol or pills to soothe the pain. It's too much. The feelings are too much. I'm hoping to go into the numb state soon, to dissociate and not care.
