Recovery Self Help BooksHi everyone!I used to post on here (under another user name) about ten years ago...! Back then I was struggling with self harm. Thankfully, I am seven years free from any SH behaviour.ÊSadly, during this time I have developed an eating disorder.Ê(Has this happened to anyone else - moving from one disordered behaviour to another?)ÊI have been suffering with Bulimia for about six years, however it's become particularly unmanageable during the last year. I have reached my tipping point, and I really want to make the step towards recovery.I am reading 'Overcoming Bulimia and Binge Eating' by Peter Cooper, as an entry to recovery and to try and so a bit of self help. If I can't do it alone, I will go to see a doctor, but for now I want to try and overcome it myself. I know it isn't going to be easy (or I'd have done it already), but I want to at least go to doctors 'prepared'.Does anyone have any other recommendations on good literature for recovery? Has anyone successfully moved towards normal eating patterns through self help alone?
