results after lumpectomy¥	 Hi everyone I just joined yesterday after receiving the results of my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. I've been told that the nodes are clear but the cancer is grade 3. The tumour measured 2.4cm. It's not hormone receptive. I'm now waiting on an appointment with an oncologist to discuss treatment. Have been told I'll need both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I'm very down at the moment and was wondering if anyone could help me out a bit with some positive stories as at the moment my head is all over the place and I'm struggling a bit. Thanks in advance, Sara xxxxNxt hurdle¥	Well hello ladies,  hope ya all sort of ok.¥	Not posted for some time.  I will b started rads in few wks.  Op (lumpectomies both sides n 12 nodes taken) was 98% successfull tho some ugly cells having got into my blood vessels so 4 wks of rads should blitz them strays.  It's been 4wks since op n I'm still so sore on the sides my nodes were taken, lots of fluid still n by the end of each day my armpit looks so swollen also still not a lot of feeling in the skin which feels really strange.  Anyone know how long this all goes on for?  Also I've been told I will b taking tamoxifen for nxt 10 yrs again anyone on this drug who can share there experience with me?  My head is in abit if a spin.. Stepping into the unknown again ¥	love Sarah
