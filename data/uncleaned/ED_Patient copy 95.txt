I think I've got an eating disorderbut don't know what to do  I have hypothyroidism too which doesn't help, but when I'm low, bored or alone, I tend to binge eat junk food and my weight is getting to be a serious concern.The problem is I'm a 31yr old male and I don't think anyone will take me seriously. I'm not sure weight watchers classes, self-help groups and that kind of thing are really going to benefit me, but I'm just not sure what help I can get or who will listen.I'm so worried which doesn't help, but I just don;t know what to do or where to turn
