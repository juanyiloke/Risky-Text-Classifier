type diagnosis  9  hii went through a preriod of about 12 months where i ate loads and loads of sweets etc as was giving up smoking so kind of took up sweets etc instead. put in a lot of weight. and randomly my doc tested me for type 2 and said im 6.8 so i am. but if im re tested every time from now on and im below say 5.5 no diabetic. does this mean im still type 2. and does it mean i ever was? could i have just had a high reading as it is based on every 3 months blood levels and i had been unusually binging up to the point of the test. i find it all confusing. i mean other than been told im type 2 how would i know?
