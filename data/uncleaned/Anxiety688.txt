could this be a deficiency? ):Could I have a calcium deficiency?So lately I have experiencing a lot of palpitations and crazy anxiety that I can't control with anything. (I've had anxiety before but it comes and goes. ..nothing like this that lasts all day for NO reason). I'm also having cramps and tingling on my legs and feet and arms. My blood pressure isn't high but it's higher than normal (116/70). Normally my blood pressure is much lower... like 90/64. And my pulse is much higher too. Well I started using magnesium oil bc I thought that might be the cause (a magnesium deficiency) but I haven't gotten better. ... so I started thinking that I don't eat that much dairy. I eat about a cup of yogurt a day and some days I don't eat any dairy. Well I'm feeling very very desperate bc this anxiety is driving me insane. Should I buy a calcium and magnesium supplement? Could this truly be a deficiency? Please Help. A month ago I had b12 and folic acid and vitamin d and I was only deficient in vitamin D ...which I have been taking 1000mgs a day. .... could this offset calcium? ?? I'm desperate....): I couldn't even sleep last night! !!
