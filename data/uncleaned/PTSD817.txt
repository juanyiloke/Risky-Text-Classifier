ÊLooking for support......Hi all,Just wanted to say hi as I've been diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist and am waiting for therapy to talk through several traumatic events from my past.Briefly, I was emotionally neglected by my mum for years(she still tries to do it now) physically assaulted by my dad on a regular basis and was bullied by my younger brother for years as a child.I have also been pulled from a crowd at a football match where I was being squashed, been assaulted by a gang of young men when I was seventeen and was in a violent / abusive marriage for ten years.I am now with someone who loves me for me but I have struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember and daily life is a struggle.Just wanted to know what I can expect from therapy as I have had several diagnoses in the past (dysthymia, BPD) and my initial assessment with adult psychology has led be me being discharged as the therapist has advised me that until I stop self harming, there is little they can do.....Anyone any advice for me?
