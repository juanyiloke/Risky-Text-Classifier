PTSD - what to do?by frankdrebin » Wed May 07, 2014 10:16 pmHi. I really need your help. I'd like to talk (write) with someone who is or were going thru this. I'm 32 yo. When I was 20, had really bad breakup. I know it sounds innocently, but I was tough shocked. After that I started to live behind the glass. I couldn't focus. I had to walk. I was frightened, depressed, dissociative. I felt anxiety. I stopped studying and I went back home. I couldn't cope with that. After few years I got used to this. I opened my own business, but still I knew Im not healed from ptsd. Still live behind the glass. In 2005 I met my wife. Year ago my son was born. From that moment I started to fight truly with my ptsd. Now I know how heavy luggage Ive been carrying. I have really deep dissociation, flashbacks, cramp in foot, sleeplessness (I do not like to sleep any way). I miss my life before that shock. I feel I live in a dream. It scares me. I feel also like I have to vomit (like finger in throat). I dont want to live like this. I even cant live like this. Please If someone had this kind of problems write to me or write a reply. I dont know what to do. Im going to therapy, but I cant cope with that syptoms.
