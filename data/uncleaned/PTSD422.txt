ÊHard to find a good trauma therapist for PTSDIs anyone else find it is really hard to find a good therapist who is knowledgeable in trauma and PTSD? I have moved and beside missing my old long term therapist, I have interviewed so many therapists who are suppose to know EMDR and trauma, but they really don't know what they are doing.ÊOne told me that most T's don't want clients with PTSD because they have to get debriefed after sessions with someone with PTSD. It's SO frustrating, it's not our fault bad things happened to us. Telling me nobody wants to work with me because of PTSD, just makes me feel like some sort of freak of nature. This is the same person who tried to push religion on me and also told me even though she was trained in EMDR, she doesn't believe in it because it caused more upset than necessary.ÊEMDR has changed my life, and has helped PTSD SO much.ÊIs it true some therapist don't want to work with PTSD because we are too hard? sigh-
