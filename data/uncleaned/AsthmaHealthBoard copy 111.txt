  Nothing will help open my chest________________________________________Had bad flu. Went to my chest a week ago.Had asthma since a child. Now im 52 and been troubled with it all my life but seems to have come back lately.On meds Prednisone 6 x5mg per day for 5 daysAntibiotic - Levofloxsacin - Winthrop 500 for 5 daysAlso on Venteze pump that doesn't seem to helpTaking bronchi dilator mixture which barely helps either.These have barely helped. Cant sleep and wake up all night due to feeling I cant breathe.Please help. What can I do next.? Surely I should have one of those all in one preventative asthma pumps with cortisone that can open my chest? Im stuck inside for over a week now and don't know what else can help.I cough a lot and have a very blocked nose too. Thank you kindlyShelley
