Skin irritation/ShavingHi,I do get a bit of ittitation on just one side of my face post shaving. To get a close shave I would have normally sort of blow out if you know what I mean but think now that this close shave is not helping. Up to last week I used a Gillette Pro Glide but have now move to Gilette sinsetive and think its a bit better. Just wondering what razor people found better for sensitive skin or any good practices to share? What about a dry shave with an electric. What that be better?Thanks in advance!
