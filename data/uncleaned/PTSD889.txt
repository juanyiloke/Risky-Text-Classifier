ÊTrying to make a bond with my son.I have been trying to bond with my son but I am so screwed up myself .I have been more than generous when it comes to money with him. He has a girlfriend and I know all his time and emotions are rapped up with her which is fine by me as long as he is happy. Because of a very abusive parents I find it so hard to connect with people .I say and do the wrong things. I can't relax around people at all ,so I am a loner but would love to be closer to him. I love him so much ,he's 24 and showing signs of depression which its breaking my heart to be honest .I want to be able to talk openly about our feelings .I tried today ,offered him a drive around whilst he was waiting for his girlfriend, just so we could talk but he refused .I have had a really bad time lately with my pdsd because (I think) I am having CBT with my forensic psychiatrist and its bringing up ugly things and making me very irreparable and nervous plus I giving up smoking ,so I am not at my best. I watch other Dads with their sons and most seem to be so close. Any tips or input would be appropriated. Dodo.
