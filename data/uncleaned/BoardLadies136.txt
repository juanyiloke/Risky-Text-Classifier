Abortion and Want to Talk :)Hello Everyone,ÊThis is a bit weird to be posting this on here but I couldn't think of anywhere else to post it. I had an abortion in England this time last year and while I have had the wondrous support of family, friends and anyone I've told, I really would like to talk to other girls in Ireland who have had abortions.I go to University everyday where there are thousands of students, and I always find myself wondering if they have been in a similar situation. There is no-one I know who is my age who I can talk to about there experience. I feel that a group, where girls could talk to each other and feel supported would really help. There are thousands of Irish women who have had abortions and I'd love to know you.Please pm me or post here if you'd like to talk.P.S. I want this to be a positive post, not disseminate into an argument about the morality or legality of abortion. There are other threads for that where you can post your feelings if you wish.Ê
