Just diagnosed with asthma________________________________________So being the typical male I supposed, I never went to the Dr much well... until I was about 42 (about 6 years ago). That was when I started having some fatigue problems, and also noticed I was having trouble with physical activities. I was very active at the time, ran marathons (was hoping to qualify for the Boston marathon) and really the only complaints I had was getting bronchitis a few times a year, for gosh... at least 20 years now, and this new fatigue I would get off an on. I knew Drs couldn't really do anything about it, so I just never bothered. I knew *something* was going on, and it was getting worse, because in training I knew to the second how fast I was running, and I could slowly see I was slowing down despite more effort, it didn't make sense to me.A few times my wife forced me to go to the Dr when the bronchitis lasted for more than a month, and the Dr did say to me that she thought I had asthma. I thought she was crazy. I have never had what I thought was an asthma attack, I just had coughs all the time, bronchitis and fatigue. No real allergies that I know of, except perhaps mold like from fall leaves that have been sitting for awhile. Anyway, bottom line is I pretty much ignored what she was saying about asthma, and the inhalers didn't do anything to my cough so I didn't bother with them. Fast forward to about a month and a half ago, when I get my typical bronchitis, and actually went to the Dr, to hear again that it was all being caused by asthma and allergies. About 6 weeks later I still have bronchitis, and then it turns to pneumonia and back to the Dr I go... where again she says she thinks it is asthma and wants me to go for a PFT when I recovered from pneumonia. Bottom line, she got the tests results back today, and it was definitely asthma, and not only that my lungs are damaged (moderate obstructive lung disease I think she said) as a result of my chronic bronchitis. So now I feel stupid, stupid for not trying to figure out why I was always getting bronchitis, stupid for listening or considering that asthma may not only be the image I had in my head of people not being able to breath and having to go to the emergency room, but mostly, stupid that I apparently did permanent damage to my lungs. Sorry this has gotten long already, so here I am, trying to learn more about this new thing to me, trying to learn what I can do to keep from getting bronchitis, trying to figure out how I am going to ride 100 miles on my bike this summer (at high altitude no doubt) lol... if I had only known before I signed up for that. =)Anyway, I have a lot of questions, but this is too long already, so I will ask in separate threads.-brad
