  Adenocarcinoma with Unknown PrimaryHi,On November 14, 2011 I was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. I had a PET scan on November 18, 2011. My oncologist said the the pet does not show the origin of the cancer. I have a tumor in my chest cavaity (but that is secondary) that has spread to my lymph nodes in that area. I live in Louisiana and have asked him to refer me to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Tx. Has anyone out there been faced with this crazy sort of thing. I just want to know where this devil is coming from so we can start treatment as soon as possible. Any advise is welcome Thanks, Lea
