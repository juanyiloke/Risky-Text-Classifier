Having A Rough NightIt's 3 AM here now, and I'm still up, feeling sensitive and scared. A lot of things are coming at me at once. The biggest thing is that I found out today that my landlord won't let me renew my lease when it ends in August. i've had a lot of traumatic housing situations, and looking for an apartment, while terrible for anyone, affects me in ways that it doesn't hit some people. Plus I've been thinking about moving to an altogether new city and not just a new apartment anyway, and now that puts pressure on me to decide and plan accordingly.I went to a support group tonight for bipolar/depression (I'm bipolar II). It was helpful in a lot of ways but also just kept reminding me that people don't like people who are mentally ill, that we have to constantly fight just for basic dignity. I can't sleep tonight (I'm also just starting a cpap, which is a big change) and I'm trying to find helpful things to do, but nothing's really working, especially since it's so hard to just visit a website or watch a video or whatever without witnessing some form of bigotry or another. I have far too many writing projects going right now, but I knew if I tried to work on them I'd just be spinning my wheels.Thank you for reading this. It's lonely here now, and it's lonely in my life right now, which is why I want to move. It's so hard to fill the hours late at night.
