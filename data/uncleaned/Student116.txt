Transferring university for my second year?by matt2042Recently I've been thinking a lot about my university and how I'm not sure if I enjoy it. I believe this is due to the university I'm currently at.I study Sport and Exercise Science at Brunel University but I'm starting to regret this as my choice. The degree is pretty laughable, I'm aware, but I feel I could do much better if I enjoyed where I was.Part of me wants to drop out, redo my A levels and apply again, maybe even on a different course.My other option is to see if I can get a transfer to my insurance choice to start my second year there. I don't know how I would go about this though. Any thoughts/advice?!
