what would you say?Things have been really tense with my sister in law anyway, she doesn't like to keep her word, especially when it comes to making plans for our kids who are 7 and younger. My sin has gotten to the point where he gets so upset when they stand us up he'll have a break down. So I stopped making plans.ÊAnyway, she decided to tell her brother, my husband, that one of the reasons she is upset with me I s because I'm just too depressed because of my anxiety that I just bring her down and she can't take that. I honestly don't even know what to say to that. Most of my fears are HA,but I can get upset over other things out of no where. Honestly, I've been doing so much better the last few months that I really feel like it's unfair for her to say anything since she's been absent. (MostlMostly in the last month is been hard because I'm pregnant again, but that's besides the point. )And we've sat down and talked about things before with no change. I'm at a loss.what would you do?
