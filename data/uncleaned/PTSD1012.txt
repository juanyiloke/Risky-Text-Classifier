I thought I would give this a try, maybe somebody have similar experiences. In January 2007 my husband and I were forced into a car by 3 gunman and held captive in a deserted field for a couple of hours. We were assaulted, they attempted to rape me and they planned to kill us. We were lucky enough to escape. We lost each other in the field and I ran for help to a farm house about a kilometre from where we were held. The very nice couple phoned the police and I then begged the man to help me to go look for my husband. He found him with the armed response searching for me. The thought of him lying somewhere in the field, possibly bleeding to death was unbearable. We were reunited and practically unharmed. A month later I fell pregnant with our baby boy (1st baby). I didnâÄ™t have time to think about that night much and had to be strong to focus on my baby. He was born 6 weeks early. The problem I have now is that I fear the same will happen to us when my son is with us (now 2 years old). It is at the point where I prefer him to be with my parents, because I am terrified that something will happen to him when he is with us. I feel like I am going crazy and it is causing tension in our relationship. Any advice?
