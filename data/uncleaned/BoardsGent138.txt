Low testosterone? Mod note Post #10Hi all,I'm just wondering have any of you been diagnosed with low T? I have just recently been diagnosed with it by my GP and have been prescribed <modsnip>. How much does this usually cost for a month's supply if any of you are on it? I have inquired at just one pharmacy and they priced it a 82 euro for the month  I have seen it for around 40 pounds on a website called <modsnip> and I'm thinking of going that route if I cant find a better price here.
