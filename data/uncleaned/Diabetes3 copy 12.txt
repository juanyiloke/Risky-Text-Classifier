Newly diagnosedI was diagnosed with diabetes recently and put on one metformin and one linagliptin per day. Since then (two weeks ago) I am even more tired than I was before going to doctors in the 1st place! also having terrible cramp like pains in my calf and feeling a bit flu like. I am not over weight and exercise 2-3 times a week and my diet has always been pretty good.The doctor also wants me to go on statins next week and I am worried about more side effects from this. Any advise or info would be greatly received.
