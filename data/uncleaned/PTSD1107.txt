Hi, I have flashbacks and relive the memories everytime I make a mistake or if something doesn''t go right for me. My dad - gordon - violently vocally abused me emotionally many times and physically a oouple of times wih continual threats of hitting me. he says tht if I can''t do simple tasks, then I belong in a mental hospital. He also shouts and spite with venom at me, whilst saying he''s giving me advice. he picks holes, and ciritices me for what I''m wearing and if I change what I''m wearing he moans again at something else. I have been abused by my Mother as well. hit around the head many times, just for being a child at ehe aga of a child, and she says something i don''t agree with then says don''t talk back to her!... I am responding to what she''s said... It also happens that she plays the victim role after being aggressive towards me and she contradicts everything I say to her. Lastly, I gave up manyjobs because of my parents voices taken on by the inner crtic. I am told that it isn''t good enough, that what i have done is earth shattering and that he''s not happy with me for it. I gaveup many jobs, called myeslf stupid and threw things around the house. I weant to be helped but i don''t know how to go about it. I don''t like therapy although you may like it, because they just go around and talk about the issues and they aren''t resolved. anyway, that''s my story except i''ve lost my home and my country - I come from UK and married in USA. anyway thanks for listening any advice will be helpful.
