ÊWho am I?Today I was talking with my twin sister while taking a shower. She's the one telling me who I am. Today she told me that I'm "adopted". She and I and our sister were all placed inside of this body by our father. She told me our life story:Lucifer (satan) pretended to be this goood looking young man to reduce women. He managed to find this young, beautiful woman about 800 years ago. They lived a happy life together. (They also had her 4 years old son who's dad had died). They wanted to have a child together. As the woman got pregnant she found out who he was. She couldn't stand being with the devil so she ran away. 9 months later she gave birth to three girls (Alexia, Seraphine and Theodora). She couldn't even look at them knowing who the dad was. She killed them all by drowning them in a river. They survived tho. Their dad couldn't let his daughters die so he saved their souls and placed them in a human body.ÊI am Alexia. I am the quiet, socially awkward sister. I hate doing things with other people and I prefer to be alone. I am quite cold and distant and usually pretty irritated.My sister Seraphine is the mean, bitchy, depressed one. She's the only one of us who remembers all of this. Our father didn't think me and Theodora could handle the truth so he made us believe we were the soul of our host body.My other sister Theodora is the emotional one. She has quite some body issues and self esteem issues and stuff like that. She's nice tho but she's not really mentally stable.
