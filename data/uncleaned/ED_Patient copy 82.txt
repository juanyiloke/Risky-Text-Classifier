Battling with Anorexia for over a yearI have been battling with anorexia and bulimia for a year and a half now, and I just really wanted to share my thoughts and feelings about my recovery hoping some of you can relate. I was diagnosed about a year ago when my family finally convinced me to get help. I've been in therapy since, but still battling with my eating disorder every day. I often feel extremely guilty about it, like this is all my fault, or that I'm doing this to myself. I know deep down that having anorexia isn't something that I would ever CHOOSE, in fact some nights I pray that I will wake up and be well again. But it will never happen like that, not without hard work. I want everyone to know that YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE EATING DISORDER - IT CHOSE YOU.My ED voice has been winning most of the battles recently, and I've hardly eaten anything for the last week or so. I don't want to be unwell, and I'm trying so hard to fight this but I feel so out of control. Which is strange because some may say that I'm completely in control - in terms of controlling not eating. But I feel the opposite. I feel completely hopeless.I want to be happy but I feel awful after everything I eat. One day I will feel free to eat what I like whenever I like without regretting every bite. And I'm going to fight hard to get there.If anyone has anything to share, please post. And if you are reading this and able to relate, then know that you are not alone!Keep fighting  Lucy x
