Feel kind of bad for feeling so goodI split up with my partner of 6 years last night and, since I have, I've felt really good. BFF says it's because I've made the right choice, and she's right. He had me in tears several times with his behaviour, and something he did over the weekend brought it home to me that he didn't really give a damn about me. I have a smile on my face today, I'm singing along to the radio, and I'm browsing recipe sites (he had a severely restricted diet) making mental notes of everything I can make for myself now. I'm mentally redecorating the bedroom now I don't have to compromise.In fact, I feel so good that I feel bad about it. I know he's there now, packing his bags and looking for somewhere to live, and I feel guilty for feeling fantastic. Do you know what I mean?
