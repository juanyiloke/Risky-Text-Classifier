The cold approach or just go with the flow?When it comes to meeting the ladies, which has worked best for you? Personally I don't know any couples that have met as a result of a guy approaching a complete stranger and chatting her up, and I've never met anyone that way myself, although I'm sure there are a few couples out there that have met this way.I've always found the cold approach a bit contrived, granted it does take balls. Any women I have been with it was always completely random, through friends or bumping into a woman outside a chippers on a night out and knocking the food out of her hand for example.  In other words, I was never successful when I actually went out and looked for a woman or when I was trying to be proactive. I think when you're not looking you're not trying as hard. Then again if you're not looking and not having any luck then maybe the proactive approach is necessary.
