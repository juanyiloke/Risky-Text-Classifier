Problems with LevemirJust curious to if anyones had recurring problems with levemir and high blood sugar?Been taking levemir for the past 12 years, but recently turned 18 and now waking up on 15+ levels even with changes to units nothing happens. Doctor has advised me to take lantis which i shall try however have heard of the awful side effects and now wary of. The high blood sugars are becoming really distressing as i'm not used to them this frequently at all, possibly could be causing my recent regular nose bleeds.
