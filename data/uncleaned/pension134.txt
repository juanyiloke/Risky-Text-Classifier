One born every minuteOne born every minute or as is the case now one baby is born every 40 secondsSo in 70 years there will be another crisis with the 'baby boomers' I wonder how many will have managed to work the new 30 qualifying years (if the new proposals go ahead) or saved in the NEST scheme for their retirement.Am I being pessimistic thinking anyone will be lucky in the future to have 30 years employment contributions let alone 45 as now?
