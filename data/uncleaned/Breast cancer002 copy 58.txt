**Anyone rec' a diagnosis of residual or recurrent cancer, soon after a mastectomy?**¥	Good Afternoon Ladies,¥	 Very Interested, to find out, if any of you, have experienced a diagnosis of either RESIDUAL or RECURRENT disease, following a mastectomy, please? (particularly within a year of your first op)¥	If that is you, too, I'd really like to hear from you (by PM if you prefer) and where you had your surgery,  if you are happy to share please?¥	 My 'story' follows - I am 44, mum of 3 kiddies - I found more, similar evidence of disease, just 8 months out from my mastectomy and breast reconstruction and am going through further treatments, with another hospital, just now - (v thankfully still with a good prognosis). But whilst I thought I was a 'rare breed' (don't we all want to be that? - just not in this context, tho!) to be back so soon, after mastectomy..... Whilst booking another element of my treatment, I have been approached by another lady, to say that her friend has had a very similar issue, at the same hospital - and is also back in treatment.¥	 Unexpected outcomes do happen, but they can't just happen and not be improved upon quickly and openly, I firmly believe that. This site is a great, reasurring resource for sharing and support and generally looking out for each other; during what can be a very isolating, frustrating experience. There are alot of us going through all this and that helps to change things.¥	 Thanks for reading my post.... X Please get in touch.
