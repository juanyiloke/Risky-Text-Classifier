Newby reaching out.

Just joined the site so will keep it short for now. I have Major Depression and Fibromyalgia amongst other things. Right now I have that horrible feeling of alienation from the world, pain, brain fog etc. I now have a support system but it doesn't fill the blankness of the days, lack of motivation, fatigue and a feeling of pointlessly existing. Confused that I want no physical contact with people but am so isolated and alone at the same time. Not sure what I want, just know that Beyond Blue is a really good organisation. Hugs, J
