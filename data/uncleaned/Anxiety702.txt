Over medicated?Hello everyone,I'm new. Year 7 of GAD - chronic, debilitating, not able to cope with the simplest of tasks when it flairs up to max power. Currently in 4th 'crisis' as the GP's label it.So i've been on citalopram (which worked for years then stopped), pronanonol - made me hallucinate, Setraline, setraline & sleeping tablet combo, setraline max strength and diazepam combo, setraline, diazepam and pregablin. The all tablets were stopped and I started venlaflaxine - I thought it was a miracle cure but it must have caught me at a time when I was on a natural up.ÊAt the moment I have done from 75m of venlaflaxine to 150mg + pregablin 100mg twice per day + Quetiapine ?35mg at night.Basically my question is, how will I ever know what it going on with me when I am pumped full of these meds, all of which have anxiety and low mood as a side affect. The NHS is awful, I wait ages to see anyone and always have to see different people. It is a month before I will get to see anyone again and I just cannot cope. It is right that one person can perscribe such a huge mix of strong drugs?I decided yesterday that I was going to stop them all but im even too scared to do that.At the moment I have about a hour a day where I can function well enough to type something like this.Other than that I am asleep or in a total state. I need to get back to work as I dont have a job that it is easy to take time out from.Does anyone else worry about being over medicated?Thank you
