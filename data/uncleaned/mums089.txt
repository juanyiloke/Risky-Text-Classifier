I cannot cope. He gets put to bed and he messes around for hours. Running around, climbing in the bathroom and squeezing all the toothpaste out, emptying the shower gel....he just will not go to sleep. He doesn't wake once he's asleep but it takes hours and I just don't know what to do. It seriously makes me cry I'm so upset.It doesn't matter whether me or my husband put him to bed, what time, whether we read a story or not, whether he's had a nap in the day or not. He still spends hours jumping around and (it feels like) deliberately trying to wind us up. We've tried the supernanny rapid return - doesn't work.Tried putting him in a room on his own - doesn't work.Staying in, or just outside the room so he knows we're there - doesn't work, he just keeps peeping round the door making a game of it.Tonight I screamed at him. Proper screamed. I hate myself for it. But I am at the end of my tether with it. It's making me really dislike my little boy . And really dislike myself because I have six year old twins as well - I could handle them but one three year old has become my nemesis?! I've left him to it now because I just can't be up there at the moment with him, I'm crying my eyes out. He's sneaked downstairs and he's in the kitchen. Can anyone offer any ideas or help? Please?
