This morning couldn't inhale ..  25  Hi I haven't had a asthma check for a while and don't take my asthma pump unless I'm wheezy (rare ) this morning I woke up feeling all bunged up I went downstairs where my legs felt like jelly I had my first cig of morning as I always do but I couldn't take a drag properly I thought it was the cig until I finished it and realised I was wheezy and couldn't take a deep breathe my chest was fully constructed I could only get a little air in I them started panic a little and took my inhaler 3 times I could barely get anything in as I couldn't inhale so I panicked more my partner checked the inhaler and said it's Deffo working but then I knew my chest wasn't after about half a hour it seems to of calmed down a little though not gone completely when I drink I also get very out of breathe does this sound like asthma I had chest pain all day yesterday and today I have a little chest pain too but it's more my breathing g don't seem right today ?
