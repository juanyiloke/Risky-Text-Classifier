Hi,ÊI have a 2.5 year old who is still in her grow bag/cot. We have recently had DC2 and she is a bit disturbed at night, waking up crying in the small hours after previously sleeping through. To top it all she has recently had a growth spurt and does seem a little bit big for her growbag. She is very keen on playing 'going to bed' with blanket / pillow and I get the feeling she might soon like a big bed. However, I had been hoping to keep her in the cot until the baby moves into it in a few months. In the mean time I was wondering about getting a little duvet to put in the cot, since she likes tucking her self up. Is this safe? What do you think the best solution for me is? Sorry if this is garbled.
