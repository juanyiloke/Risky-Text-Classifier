Feeling confused I suffer from depression and anxiety. Both of which stem from physical and sexual abuse as a child. The depression began around age 12, but the anxiety issues showed up more so in my adult life. My father physically abused my until age eight when he finally left. My mother never appeared to do anything to my knowledge to stop him or protect me. After he left, my mother abandoned me in a childrens home at the advice of a family friend. Strange how this "home" had tall barbed wire fences around the perimeter. Anyways, the additional physical and sexual abuse occured there at the hands of the adult employees. I had no way to contact the outside world. My anger and hate feeling for my mother intensified during my 6 years there. This is also when my hopeless feeling began. Ok, long story shorter, recently my mother suffered a heart attack in only my presence. I reacted out of instinct (training) and saved her life. SO HERE IS THE NEW ISSUE: i now feel regret for saving her. This feeling is confusing and depressing. I'm struggling with the thought that my one chance for "payback", for lack of a better word, presented itself and I missed it. On the other hand, biology makes my feel like "you had to, she is your mother".ÊThanks for listening...
