I think I am addicted to sugar. Is this bad? Hi, I'm 15 and I really eat a lot of choclate and sugary foods (I have been for about 1-2 years) . I work out and study quite a lot so I lose a lot of the glucose I get from it, but recently (last month) I have been getting very thirsty very fast, I drink almost 1 liter of water during my 2 hour workout time! And each night I bring a mug of water and drink it throughout the night (I wake up thirsty, drink some water, then sleep again).  I've been told excessive sugar use leads to constant dehydration, which makes the body start using the fluids in your cells, dehydrating them, I've noticed this in my eyes, they seem to have gotten smaller! Three days ago when I realized this , I immidientally stopped eating any kind of sugar (I only use 1-2 teaspoons of sugar in my tea daily, and sometimes from coca cola). I don't know if I'm over reacting or if this is something I should seriously be worried about. I'm currently planning on not using sugar until my thirst for water goes back to normal.
