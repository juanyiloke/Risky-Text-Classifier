Does Abuterol make your heart race?________________________________________Hello guys, I finally went to a pulmonologist last week who said I have asthma and also sinusitis. The number for asthma, which I can't remember the measurement, said I was 26. The doc explained anything over a 20 indicates asthma. Anyway, he gave me Symbicort, which I had been taking on and off in the past twice a day once in the morning and once at night. However, the doc told me this time I need to take two puffs in the morning and two at night. Also, if I'm really feeling crappy I can take two puffs around lunch. I asked if I should wait between taking these two puffs, and he said no and to take them both at once.Lately these past few days usually around or before I go to sleep, I have felt something like a sudden shock to my heart. My heart starts racing loudly, and I find it hard to breath. It lasts for around 30 seconds, but I get really upset because I don't know if I should go to a hospital or something, so I lie awake in worry. Urgh. Any ideas? Thanks.
