ÊWorried I'll be diagnosed with BPDI'm seeing my GP again tomorrow and hopefully I'll be able to ask for my appointment with the clinical psychologist moved to a much closer date (I was told I would get an appointment within 4-8 weeks).ÊI'm really scared that I'll get diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. My head always feels like such a crazy disturbed mess, and I can't help thinking that BPD is the real cause.ÊI know all mental disorders are terrible and stigmatised, but I'm especially worried about being BPD. There's such a heavy stigma surrounding this disorder, even mental health professionals don't want to go near them!ÊEverybody online talks about what selfish, horrible, childish evil people we are and nobody can stand being around Borderlines.ÊWhen I look up help websites for BPD most of them seem to be websites offering help and advice to victims of being in a relationship with a Borderline, rather than helping the BPD sufferers themselves.ÊIt's like Boderlines are the scum of the MH world, and the prospect of being labeled as such terrifies me. I won't be able to tell any of my family because I'll be so ashamed.ÊI know I'm being whiny and stupid and babyish about this, but its really upsetting me.Ê
