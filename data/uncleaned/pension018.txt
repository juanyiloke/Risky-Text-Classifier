SNPLooks like the SNP will have a big influence over the way England is run in the future, who hail from a country where very many do not want anything to do with England, we get stuck with all their drunks they export to this country, we have  been lumbered with three useless recent Scottish Prime Ministers, Blair, Brown, Cameron, and as for the excuse for music from those octopuses they wear round their necks, we have to suffer, the less said the better Why did the  English not get a vote on their referendum.
