I've crossed the finishing line! (Last day of rads)¥	Hello!¥	It's great to see so many happy people on the forum today. :) Congratations Ali Owl on becoming a NEDDY and well done LittleSusie for losing a stone!¥	My good news for today is that I finished rads this morning! I'm free from hospital appointments until 24 June when I go back to see my oncologist for my final appointment.¥	It's been a long journey (268 days from finding the lump, in fact!), but I have made it and I know everyone else here can too. Thank you to everyone that's replied to me when I've posted questions, especially George and mistymoley. You've really helped me through this.¥	Good luck to everyone here.¥	Hugs, Caroline xCording?¥	Hello¥	A quick question about cording if I may... I started radiotherapy this week and have been much more aware of that part of my body as a result. I've had a few twinges around the scar line of my lumpectomy, but put that down to an overly tight bra (thanks for the weight gain chemo!). This afternoon I noticed a thin rope like line running along the edge of my arm pit above where I had my lymph nodes removed. It's not the same under my 'normal' arm. I've also noticed that my arm can feel tight sometimes like something is pulling slightly when I stretch it out. Could this be cording? My surgery was back in October and I was doing arm exercises until mid-Feb. If it is cording is there anything I can do to ease it?¥	Thank you!¥	Caroline xx
