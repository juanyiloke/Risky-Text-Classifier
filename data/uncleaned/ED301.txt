ÊEveryone's WatchingIs it just me or is it possibly even more difficult to eat when you know everyone's watching you?I had another Dr. appointment today and found that my weight had dropped once again from the previous visit. Both of my parents came with me because they've been really worried lately. The doctor started telling me the dangers that I was putting myself in by weighing as little as I do, and by eating as little as I do- some of which I had no idea. He put me on a meal plan- certain amount of calorie meals 3 times a day, plus an Ensure or a Boost either in the morning or afternoon- and I'm not supposed to work out anymore (except a 15-20 minute walk). My mom went around and peeled the labels off because she knew they were stressing me out, so I can't see how many calories are in them, and honestly I don't even want to know.ÊI felt so guilty about eating my dinner tonight that I still ended up throwing some of it out.ÊI want to do this because this mess is effecting my entire life. Work is almost too difficult now, and I feel like I'm about to pass out half the time. My body is weak and tired, always. Considering my passion is in horseback riding, my hobbies are taking a huge toll too. I've been having a lot more trouble with my riding lately, and almost had to cancel last time altogether.So, I want my life back. Obviously I do. But the numbers are scary, and now everyone is watching to make sure I do what I'm supposed to do. The scale was put back into the bathroom but I'm afraid to watch the numbers go up.
