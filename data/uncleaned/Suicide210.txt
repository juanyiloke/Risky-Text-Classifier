Things were great... (were)Been in a good place for a long time, possibly longest time of my life. Until last week.As with depression there are ups and downs and I have learned to deal with them. This time though, its situational. I think that makes it worse. Mainly because it was entirely preventable.The situation will go one of two ways. Minimal damage but damaging none the less or maximum damage. The latter is more likely and the most scary. It literally has the potential to decimate many lives. I cant eat, sleep or function properly. This effects my entire family and they are turning to me for answers I cannot possibly give them.All I can do is sit and wait and it is literally killing me. I feel sick.I cannot envisage anything being ok after this.My second chance is gone. I am toxic. I wish I was never born.
