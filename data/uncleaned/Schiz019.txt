Thinking that people wants to kill meby CatSlave » Mon May 04, 2015 1:32 pmI am not schizophrenic but I want to ask if I could be but I don't think so because I don't hear voices or hallucinate. My problem is that I think that everyone wants to kill me and I can't concentrate because of being aware of everyone. Also it makes me nervous and because of that I prever avoiding people or talking to them. I don't know if I am avoidant and my fear is due to thinking that people is judging me because I am a bit alexitimic but I do feel like people wants to kill me. Also I always go at the street at night or when there is nobody because when I am thinking something beautiful and I see someone I quickly remember my fear of being killed and I get nervous and also depressed.I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I think probably depression because my doctor [psych.] gave me antidepressants and I went a lot better and sometimes I don't even think that people wants to kill me but unfortunately some days I start thinking it again.I've been this way years. But when I started taking antidepressants I could see the difference between fearing people and feeling safe.I am posting this here because I don't want to tell this to my psych. because she probably would give me antipsychotics and I don't want to get fat. People told me that antipsychotcs made you fat and also I have tried them and it felt awful.What do you think?
