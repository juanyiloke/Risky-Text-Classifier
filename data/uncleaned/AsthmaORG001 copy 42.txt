Struggling with HIIT workouts Hi :)I've just attempted a couple of HIIT (High intensity interval training) workouts and really struggled with them. For the most part I couldn't finish them. I haven't tried this kind of workout for a long time but I'm surprised at how much I struggled. I expected to find them hard and to need to build my stamina, but didn't think they'd have too much of an impact on my asthma. I do 1 hour of pilates and 1 hour of cardio a day, plus walking at least 1 mile a day and swimming a few times a week, I can't just be unfit! Has anyone else struggled with this kind of workout? I used my inhaler before as normal, but needed it again when I was only 5 minutes in!I'm giving up for tonight and I'll try swimming in the morning, but I just find it all a bit odd! Is it the style of workout that could be a problem?
