Whats the point, why not?JonMy moms a stripper and my dad was gone my entire childhood for drugs so i didnt even know him, the only personwhos really cared about me my grandmother has reacently passed so now im living with my uncle who doesnt give a shit about me oh and btw i got drunk and slept with his ex wife because i despise him and he still doesnt know, im on a downhill rollercoaster doing things and never thought id do and i like most of them and its tainted who i am and what i use to believe in. Im young and fit and in te national guard wich sucks btw, all we do is clean we dont train and we dont hae any live fires for the entire year, and my life is going absolutly nowhere good and i think im just going to end up hurting the people close to me so i just wish ididnt exist sometimes like right now, suicide doesnt sound bad but I dont want to hurt the people i care about anymore then i have, if i could just dissapear and have everyone that knows me just forget i even existed i would, i think about ways that i could just make myself disappear without having anyone i care about hurt by it
