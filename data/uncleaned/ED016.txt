the stress of outgrowing clothesAs I am physically recovering, I'm gaining naturally weight, and with that I'm quickly out growing my clothes. I HATE the feeling of putting something on and having a tight feeling. So i got rid of all clothes thst has a "fixed" size (like jeans). I notmally like wearing loose or baggy clothes, I've stared wearing leggings because it is much more comfortable and less stressful to put them on.I've also been trying to view my clothes as temporary. I don't want to get attached to anything I wear because I'm likely going to out grow it.Does anyone have other good suggestions?
