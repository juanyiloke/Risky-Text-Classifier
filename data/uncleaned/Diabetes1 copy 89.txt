How much are you worth?HolaDoes anybody know or could point me in the right direction in regards to finding out how much extra funding a gp gets when someone is diagnosed as diabetic?Also is it tiered or across the board? Eg would someone on insulin or diabetic drugs have a higher funding level than someone on diet and exercise. Or t1/t2 etc etcAnd while we are at it - is that funding Dependent on you completing your minimum diabetic care standards for eg at least one blood test per year, eye screen etc.Cheers.
