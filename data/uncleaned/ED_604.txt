How to cope with triggers?I am trying to recover from an eating disorder for good, but it's been a bumpy road (when isn't it?). At my lowest I was vegan and partially using that as an excuse to feed my ED, now that I am vegetarian again I have gained a couple of pounds and I'm still having a little trouble accepting that.ÊOne of my triggers however is feeling even the slightest bit full. It makes me think bad things about myself, and I think this is because I used to have a binge eating issue when I was younger. I would eat until I felt like I was going to burst simply because I loved food so much. It made me overweight as a kid and now that I'm older I'm deep down really afraid to gain all that weight back even though I mostly eat according to hunger cues now.ÊI have other triggers as well, but I'm looking for a way to cope in general and not relapse again. I can't count calories but I'm always afraid I'm eating too much even though I'm most likely not.
