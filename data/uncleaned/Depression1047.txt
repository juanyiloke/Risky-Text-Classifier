Lack of motivationHi,My name's Bec and I have had depression for about 3yrs now. After just recently going through a bad patch I am now getting  better and feeling more my usual self. However one thing I struggle with is motivation, its so easy to just sit and watch TV all day. I have a job and study, which I love both but I cant seem to get motivated to work or attend class, even little things I enjoy doing like going for a walk seem like such an effort.Anyone got any advice on how to get motivated and keep motivated to do things?Thanks :)
