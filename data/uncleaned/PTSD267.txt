Are some people more susceptible to have PTSD than others?by Jam4 » Sat May 17, 2014 2:30 amI think I'm susceptible for PTSD. I've got it on two issues: domestic violence and being in a fire with my 2 smaller kids.The domestic violence happened with first husband when I was 21 years old. He was diagnosed with situational depression, but I swear he had BPD. He would scream every name in the book and throw things in my direction. He intimidated me in front of our kids(then 2 and 4). He choked me 4 times all in front of the girls crying. I didn't fight back, so it wouldn't get worse. I was so terrified he would kill me. The last straw for me was when he was drunk and on sleeping pills. He grabbed me and threw me to the bed and started choking me. I couldn't fight him off. All I could think about is that my daughters going to watch me die. Years later, I still have nightmares, and think about it often. I flip out watching violence in front of kids in movies or elsewhere. Constantly worried he's going to come find me and kill me or our daughters. The second thing is the fire that just happened in November, 2 days after my 3rd daughter's birthday. My daughters,5 and 3, were trapped on the third story apartment building. We were screaming for help, but no one came. I called the fire department and they eventually rescued us. The fire started in the apt directly under us. We got all the smoke and it burned our throats. I'm still having trouble with smelling smoke of any kind and flip out when I see a fire. At night I see black smoke in my room. I'm so afraid I won't be able to save my kids if it happens again, because of how afraid I am. I've developed an anxiety disorder because of it. My trigger is being alone with my 2 little ones. I've started having anxiety attacks. I'm trying to talk it out, because my husband doesn't understand what I'm going through. I need to talk to someone.
