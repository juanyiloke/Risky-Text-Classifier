  I realized what my strength isToday was pretty terrible for me, as was yesterday. I slept in on accident and missed my morning  shift. Then I had to leave my class early because I was nauseas with nervousness about a girl . I was sooo sick to my stomach. Headches, procrastination, rage (not over her). And then I was sitting down writing and I realized, I don't have any skills necessarily. Don't know if I"m actually smart , I"m a terrible athlete, got no charisma, not eloquent. But even if there's not much as I'm capable of, I always  try. My friends disappear, but I've gone to other places trying to meet people. I don't know if school is worth anything or if I'm good at it, but I'm close to finishing so I'm going to finish, etc.And I realized that no matter what I feel or what I think about my lack of accomplishment, I've gotten past the point where giving up is an option. As terrible as things are, as awful as I felt today, I knew that I would make it to the end because I always do. It's all I know how to do. That's my strength  right now. Step one of many, maybe.
