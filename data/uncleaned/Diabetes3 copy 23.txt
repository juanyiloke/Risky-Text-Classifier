Lumbar Steroid EpiduralsI'm scheduled to have an epidural into my lower back as a result of nerve impingement (identified on MRI's). I wonder if anyone else had advice to give me on their experience of this in particularly the impact on blood glucose levels.I've heard that the steroid can cause a temporary hike in levels and having recently been dx and trying to control this myself, this concerns me. The medics I've consulted seem pretty clueless on this to be honest. Truth is, whilst I still have bad lower back pain, it's clear to me that the numbness in my foot and leg pain was partly attributable to undiagnosed diabetes so I'm wondering whether to cancel the procedure completely. The efforts I'm making to stabilise my BG levels seem to be helping and the relief from the epidural is only short lived. Any thoughts?
