Ya I was wondering if by "hearing voices" that means hearing two distinct voices. Like I sometimes will talk to myself in my head but the actual sound of the voices are the same. For example i'll say in my head, "should I go to the golfing range?" and then i'll answer myself, kinda like that. But mainly I want to know if by hearing voices that means two distinct voice tones, and if having short conversations with myself is the same thing as hearing voices.
