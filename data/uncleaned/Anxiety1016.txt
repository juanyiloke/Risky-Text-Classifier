help... feels like I am going insane.So i have been researching my issues for a while now and decided I would make my own post. I have always had anxiety, but it increased tremendously when I got to college. I started having a large amount of relationship anxiety with my long term boyfriend. I started questioning my love for him and was worried that we would not make it. This has caused a lot of issues, because I doubt my own love. Next, I had gotten a haircut and my brother made the comment of saying It made me look like a lesbian. I laughed it off, but the next day I started worrying that I liked girls!! I was so disgusted that this thought was even coming up, given that I never liked girls my entire life. And the thoughts just dont end. My brother jokes around and says stuff like hey hun, or whatever and one day i took it to heart and worried that i like my brother. I tell myself that the thoughts were sporadic and that there is no signs to show that the thoughts are true, but yet I cant get the thoughts to go away. I feel like Im going insane, and if anyone hears what im thinking they will think i am crazy... I just dont know how one day i could wake up randomly and think i turned lesbian or that i like my own brother!!! so weird.. help???
