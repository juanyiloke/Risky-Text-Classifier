My LO is 5.5 months old and im looking to start weaning her off BF as of June time. We go on hols next week and think its wise to continue whilst abroad. At the moment she has one bottle of formula at night as a dream feed, and takes 6-7oz. She was also, up until last week, taking a bottle of EBM during the day...but she has decided she doesnt want that now and screams until she is BF! Looking for all hints and tips. A gradual wean or a quicker wean...all ideas welcome! I go back to work in september. Regardless of work, we are ready as a family to wean onto bottle. Im pretty chuffed i got to 6 months!ÊMany thanks xx
