you can trust othersI've been suffering with depression and anxiety for years and 2 doctors have told me it's my fault because i'm overweight. I didn't feel as though I could seek help until I lost weight, which became increasingly difficult the worse my depression got.Then I tried again. After 3 years of feeling hopeless and as though I would never get better. And I'm so glad I did.My new GP was lovely when I explained everything. He listened, and I started on my antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication today!I'm so relieved, and so glad I tried again instead of just accepting that I'd caused my own mental ill-health.If you feel as though you can't trust you GP to do what's right by you, try a different GP. It's well worth it!
