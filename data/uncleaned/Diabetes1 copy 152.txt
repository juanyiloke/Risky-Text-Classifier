BewilderedI'm bewildered. I 've known for years one of my neighbours is diabetic. The other day I got to talk to him about it. He told me how long he had had it and how he handled it.He is Type 2 --takes Metformin, another one I did not catch and insulin. Also 2 pills for Blood pressure and a statin.He said and I will try to compress it--Diabetes Nurse is very very pleased with him. Always gets his carbs in at every meal, tries to keep his BG readings level, takes his pills and eats what he likes. Has 6 meals or snacks per day.I asked what he had that day. Breakfast bowl of Sugar Puffs with milk then 2 slices white bread toast with marge and Marmalade, He always tests his BG just before his morning snack of a bread roll marge and ham with tomato. He only tests once a day.I ask him what BG reading he got ( still reeling from the toast and marmalada). He said it was on target that morning at 16. DN likes it to stick at 16 to 18.I could not think of anything to say. I know he is touchy and prickly so made no comment.All his other food "gets the carbs in" Mid afternoon snack he always likes. He has two or even three chocolate digestive biscuits with his cup of tea.His attitude is simple. He eats what he wants and the pills take care of it.My head is still working out all of this and failing.I'm on a very low carb diet and don't take any vile pills--especially not the ones my so called GP prescribed.I always check Saturday as I wake up. I expect it to be between 5.5 and 6.5. Not often I check at midnight after a particular meal I want to check up on. Even after a huge Indian with Poppadoms and pickle A main course half a veg dish and a Naan and two lagers I only hit 7.8.But oh how I would love to eat a pudding. Or spaghetti carbonara or a beef and ale pie with crunchy pastry. Or mash with cream and butter. Or rissotto.Should I follow my neighbours example? He is fit as a fiddle at 78. Something badly wrong somewhere.Someone is being conned her.
