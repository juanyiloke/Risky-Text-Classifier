Work threatening the sack.. Hey everyone. I just wondered if anyone has had a similar experience as to what I have today.I've been suffering with depression and anxiety since I was 14, and I finally got help last summer, where I also found out I have psychosis.Long story short, I'm only getting around 2hrs sleep a night, and I'm still trying to find medications that work for my conditions - which are crippling.I work in the NHS and I've been signed off work since the end of Feb. I had another meeting with the health and wellbeing department today (NHS trust policy), and they are saying if I don't return to work at the end of my current sick note.. Then they will look at redeploying me into a less paid roll or to get rid of me all together. My current sick note expires 11th May.Can anyone offer any help or advice on how to handle this? My workplace aren't supporting my recovery at all.Thank you for any commentsRachael
