Good peak flow but having worsening symptoms? Hi there,Apologies if this sounds like a dumb question but is it possible to have a good peak flow reading but still be feeling tight chested and a little wheezy? I've felt my symptoms get worse over the last few days and I can't make up my mind if it is due to the weather changes we've had recently, the pollution/pollen or just because I reduced my inhaler intake (because I was feeling fine and peak flow was excellent).I take an inhaler that is a preventer and long acting bronchilater so not sure whether this is masking worsening symptoms and helping to keep my peak flow up? Hoping it's just a bad week for asthma/hayfever. What are other people's experiences with these types of inhalers? Thanks
