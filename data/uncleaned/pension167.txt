BurgelersHas any one seen the story of the young mum and  her child, who where confronted by two men threatening to enter her home, well apparently she frightened them off with a large kitchen knife.Later on in the day or night she was warned by the police about her behaviour with the knife.What could that poor woman have done in the circumstances.My thoughts where she should have asked the police for a signed document as to what she was being warned about, and they would have had to go back to their senior officer to get one.on production of this signed document, the woman would probably been able to charge the police with aid and abetting.I wonder then if police would change the way they came on to people, when a crime in the first place had been committed to them.Yorkie
