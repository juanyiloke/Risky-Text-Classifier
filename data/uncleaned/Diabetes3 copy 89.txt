HbA1C Nerves!So, I had to go for bloods today ready for pump clinic next Friday and now appear to be a bag of nerves over what the results will show! I know I can't change the results, they will be what they will be but it doesn't stop me worrying. It's like waiting for exam results. I am desperately hoping to have broken into the 50's, last A1C was 60 so anything under that would be excellent. I just feel like I'm going to let myself and my team down.Urgh, I just want it over and done with!Whinge over.
