Latest PSA results Just to report my 2 year PSA results received today - "virtually undetectable". I should have received the results last Monday but there was a mix up at the hospital and I had to have a 2nd blood test!I have to admit I have been on edge for a while but now feel quite relieved (until next time!). Despite ongoing side effects it is good to be still alive.I felt it best to post results in the hope that it gives hope to others travelling a similar path, but I am very conscious of others whose PCa is more aggressive.Sending best wishes to all.
