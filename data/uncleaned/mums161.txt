Dd is 9 months and I will be going back to work when she is 1. Childcare should be a combination of nursery, hopefully some grandparent help and maybe a nanny to cover other times. I have never spent more than about 2 hours away from her. I just don't know how this will work.ÊShe is eating solids, but not as much as I'd hoped she would be by now. She drinks water and has 3 meals a day but still breastfeeds quite a lot. I've tried giving her some breast milk in her cup but she will still want to breastfeed. She won't use a bottle. I'm hoping she'll take expressed milk from another person when I'm not there but so far not had a chance to test this out. She will eat a big meal, drinks loads of water and still cry for a feed soon after! Nothing else will calm her!My other worry is nap time. I get my dd to sleep. Whether she falls asleep feeding, or being rocked or walked in the pram. That is how she gets to sleep. I know I should do sleep training but I can't do it. She gets so distressed and I get distressed and I'm pretty much constantly on edge at the moment. I soon resort back to my usual methods to get her to sleep.My other worries are just general day to day activities, what will happen? What do nurseries and nannys do with a baby?I know I'm lucky to have had a year off but I'm getting so scared. I can imagine my dd crying and not being looked after. On one hand I'm absolutely desperate for a break, I'm always on the verge of tears, I never get any alone time, but on the other hand I'm scared she won't be looked after properly. I am quite aware I'm coming across as pathetic here but I'd still love some reassurance. Will she forgot me?
