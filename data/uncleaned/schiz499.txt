Êbizarre thinking, sign of relapse?Hi there,ÊMy mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 46 (late on set). She refused to take her medication for 6 years but stabilized after using her meds regularly and relapse free for the last 10 years.She's now 62. She hasn't been working since the onset but she's a full time caregiver, looking after my nephew during the day, and my dad in the evening as well as helping my cousin's kid with his studies, cooking for him on his lunch break etc and overall taking care of stuff for the extended family. She's very busy and I'm wondering if it's affecting her mental health.She didn't have a relapse for the last 10 years. But last night my dad, my mom and my sister were having dinner. She was talking about my cousin who had never gotten married (family is almost convinced he's gay, he came out to some members of the family but it's somehow never discussed, semi-secret) saying he should get married to my other cousin. and I mean they are first cousins! There's no cousin-marrying in any side of the family, no disrespect to people who marry their cousins but as far as our family goes this is quite a creepy and bizarre thing for her to say! and I don't have any recollection that she'd condone cousin marrying prior? My question is, would that imply any sign of relapse somehow?p.s. I have been living in an another continent for the last decade and don't really have means to monitor her well being on a daily basis hence the question.
