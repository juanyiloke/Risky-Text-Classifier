I Think I'm On The Road To Recovery?I've suffered with depression and anxiety for about 6 years but recently I seem to have turned a corner. 3 weeks ago I started taking new supplements which seem to be what's making me feel better, I've even cut down to 50mg of Sertraline from 100mg with seemingly no negative effects. I've started to do things that I rarely/never used to do like get dressed in fresh clothes everyday and open the curtains to let some light in. I now also make a concious effort to leave the house everyday even if only for a 5-10 minute walk, which is still a bit frightening but a buzz when I get home. The main thing is just my general happiness is up and feeling relaxed. I've been taking Noopept, choline bitartrate, inositol and L theanine. I'm not saying it's a miracle combination but it seems to work well for me, it might be something else completely unrelated that's making me feel the way I do, but either way I'm happy and thought I would experience with you.
