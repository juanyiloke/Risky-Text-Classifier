Avoiding TreatmentI have been receiving treatment from a community mental health team and an eating disorder unit for around 6 months. About 3 months ago, I was transferred to a new team, to allow me to move back to university. I've encountered a lot of problems and had a lot of disagreements with this new team, to the extent that I am considering taking time out of university and moving back home. I have been steadily gaining weight and feeling much more positive recently, also I personally, and people who are close to me, say that they feel I am overcoming a lot of the symptoms that I was showing a few months ago. However, recently I haven't been attending my meetings with the clinic as all they seem to be achieving is stressing me out and therefore impacting on my eating.ÊObviously I am aware that it is sensible to be monitored by a team for a while yet, but does anybody know the actions that would be taken by the team i currently see if i continue to not attend the meetings while i am looking for a new unit to be seen by?
