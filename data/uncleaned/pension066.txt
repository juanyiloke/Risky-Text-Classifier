Rant alert!   Racing around town like a mad thing, short on time and tolerance, went into WHSmith's.  Needed to be on the first floor, access was via a narrow steep staircase.  Half way up I encounter a young mum with a toddler.  She was allowing the boy to climb up the stairs - and stop on every one for approbation of his achievement!  Staircase too narrow to pass them, also could not go back down as there was quite a queue behind me.  While I appreciate that children have to learn to deal with stairs surely this should be done at home, or grandmas, or a friends house  - a busy shop in the rush hour is not an appropriate schoolroom !!  On the bus coming home - young mum with a baby buggy the size of a small tank.  The buggy took up the whole of the buggy zone thus rendering the three pull down seats useless. Young mum sits on the next double seat with her offspring beside her.  That is five seats taken up by two people.  Although there were a lot of people standing she made no attempt to take the child on her knee and free up a seat.  Why take the child out of the buggy in the first place?  Grrr rr rr !!
