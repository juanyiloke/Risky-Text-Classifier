 Unable to keep distractedHi I'm having problems because i cannot keep distracted all day, naturally. I've been reading '8 keys to safe trauma recovery' which was recommended by my previous psychologist. It talks about how time undistracted can send you in a bit of a spin. The author says she used to do some kind of puzzle i cannot remember, to keep her brain busy. I've decided to join this forum to keep my mind busy during this time every day. This is the time of day when i find i can end up having thoughts like 'my life isn't worth living', and similar things like that. I seem to spiral downward pretty easily when i've nothing to do. I feel great panic over it. Does anyone have any experience with this or any tips on how to deal with it.Many ThanksFuscia x
