exit bag with CO2 scrubJakeExit bag sounds like a nice and fast way to go, except my budget’s kinda small so I doubt I can afford the gasses and I’m not a fan of drugs. And I thought maybe I could get rid of the CO2 with a scrub – soda lime, most likely, but I’m open to ideas.I imagine it like this – linked together: me with a nrb mask -> pump/ventilator -> scrub -> bag of air (volume 2-3 breaths) -> (me). Oxygen levels drop, CO2 get’s scrubbed away. I die nice and easy.Or so I’d like. Thoughts?
