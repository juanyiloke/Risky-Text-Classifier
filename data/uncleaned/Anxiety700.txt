House buying and GADHallo folks. I'm buying a house. Well, half a house, my sister is having half too. We both suffer from stress, anxiety and a load of other conditions.The story so far...Our parents know about our mental health problems and have decided to use my dads inheritance to buy my sister and I a house so we can be secure and try and put our lives back together. Nice of them, but then it's mostly their fault we are messed up in the first place, damn hippies!So far so good. I coped with viewings (my sister currently lives miles away). She coped with phone calls. We found a house! We made an offer. It was accepted!Now it's all paper work and worrying and hoping nothing bad happens.I had a minor operation 3 weeks ago, it coincided with our offer being accepted, and ever since I have had palpitations and feel shaky and weak. My doc ran bloods to check I didn't have an infection or any other complications and everything came back clear so now I'm thinking that my symptoms are all about stress over the house.I have had anxiety ever since I gave up drinking. I have other mental health issues too but I've never physically felt quite this bad all the time. I have had panic attacks in the past but they tend to pass and this thing is constant.Does this sound like the kind of physical anxiety symptoms that I should expect while doing something this stressful? I keep fretting that something is physically wrong and being missed but I guess that is part of the panic feeling?Does anyone one have any advice to help us cope with everything? Thanks for taking the time to read this. Thanks for any advice too.
