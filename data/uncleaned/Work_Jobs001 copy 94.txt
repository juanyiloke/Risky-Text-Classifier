Promotion i don't want________________________________________I am very stressed at the moment in work as there a lot of promotion opportunities coming up and I feel huge pressure to apply for them. I have been in an 'acting up' role in the last few months to cover maternity leave, and it will be seen as expected that I apply for these promotions. I have worked in the department a long time and am seen as a good worker and have done well in performance reviews. However, I am reluctant to take on the additional responsibility at this point (I have a toddler and would love another child and am very worried about managing work/life balance, I also suffer with anxiety which is really adding to the problem!). There will also be an element of people management which I have no previous experience. However, I don't want to seen as unmotivated and not conscientious. I worry it will be seen as very odd to be seen not to apply for these positions and worry about the impact it would have on any future career prospects. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
