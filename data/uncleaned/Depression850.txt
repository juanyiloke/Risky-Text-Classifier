My DepressionI have found that my depression has been really impacting my life. Minor activities seem like mountains to climb. I just want to get back to "me" before depression took over. My depression came after a couple of traumatic events ( I also have ptsd ). The panic attacks made go into a state of "freeze" rather than fight or flight. Severe depression crept in causing me to seek professional help. I waited a bit too long. I guess it is better late than never. I also do watch some you tube self help videos. It has been difficult to do the minor activities of daily living. I have had adverse reactions unfortunately to Prozac etc. the only drug I believe I have not tried yet is Welbutrin (sp). I see my psychiatrist in two days. I have not had a chance to see him in over a year. I appreciate this site being available. Wishing everyone a beautiful day.
