This is something I'm only telling you- my secretI can't stand my body. I can't stand the number on the scale but I'm too weak-willed to do anything about it. I lie here in bed pretending to myself I can't walk so I can't get up and eat. I don't have an eating disorder. No one would diagnose me because my BMI is in the normal range. How in the world can this much belly fat, thigh fat, love handles, etc. look *normal* to anyone?! Some of my friends say I'm a twig some days but other days my mom will pat my belly and ask why it's sticking out so much.ÊSo I'm trying to massively, massively restrict today and tomorrow and possibly Saturday and Sunday because I legitimately need to eat way less. For the last week my diet has consisted of nothing but sweets. I didn't calorie-count at all and I gained some weight and now I am trying to correct it. I wonder if I will be able to stick to the strict calorie limit I've set for myself. When I say I don't deserve to eat I don't mean it in the sense that I'm not worthy of food- I mean I'm better than that, or at least I should be. Getting fatter would be too much to bear and I don't deserve that kind of grief. Therefore, I don't deserve food and the punishments it brings.There's no way in hell I'm telling my psychologist any of this because she'd think I'm making it up for attention. I probably am.
