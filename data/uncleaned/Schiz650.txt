ÊWhat do you think of these symptoms?Hi everyone -I would like to share what I am seeing (from the outside) in my son who has been diagnosed at the hospital as having unspecified psychotic disorder. He is on a strong dose of Abilify and that's all right now. Here's what I am seeing:He likes to jog around the house with his earphones on listening to music. As he runs he occasionally will start laughing and/or squealing. He also laughs and smiles for no reason throughout the day. It looks like he's enjoying an inside joke - only he knows the joke. He used to talk to himself but that has stopped. But the running around all the time continues and the music seems to activate the laughter.Have any of you ever gone through this? Maybe he needs a new medication. He wants to take an antidepressant and the doc is thinking of a anticonvulsant like Lamictal or another one.My son denies ever hearing voices or having visual hallucinations. Do you think maybe he doesn't remember correctly? They said at the hospital (last November) that he was hallucinating and was delusional.Any thoughts?Thanks for your help.
