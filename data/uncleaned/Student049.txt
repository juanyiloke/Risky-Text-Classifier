How much should I save for University?by lizmoo0721I have saved a couple grand over the years for University mainly, but I'm not sure how much I will actually need. I am planning on getting a job over the summer and while at university. I keep seeing things I want to buy, like new shoes or some new clothes but I feel like I should have the money for university instead. Do you think roughly (a few thousand) is enough to go into University with? My parents are unlikely to provide me with any money while at uni and I am over the threshold for the grant, so I don't get that much.Any advice would be appreciated.
