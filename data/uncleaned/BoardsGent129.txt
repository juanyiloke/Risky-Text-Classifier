Job TitleI was out with the lads at the weekend and we got laughing and joking about wealthy people and golf and a debate started.If a wealthy person was paying you 1000euro a week to lug around his golf clubs at the weekend would you take it? (Bear in mind this isn't a job on the side- its your full time job that you just so happen to do once or twice a week).To my suprise most of the lads (and then my family the following day when I asked them) most of them said no. They'd rather take a less paying job with a nice title such as company director/senior technical person (regardless of what the actual day-to-day job actually encompasses). Just so long as it doesn't make them sound to other people like they are a skivvy.Personally Id rather be a high earning skivvy than a lower earning company director. What about you lads? What would you rather?
