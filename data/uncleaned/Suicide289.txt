Tired. Sad. Stupid day.I'm tired. Therapy is hard, studying is hard, life is hard. It just seems so pointless sometimes. Why do I have to keep trying, keep fighting, keep going? I know it can get better - in principle... But it certainly does not feel like it.. And even if it does get better sometimes, I'm still tired. Still struggling.. Why does it always has to be so hard... I know I don't have anything to complain about. I'm quite healthy, have money, food etc. etc.. But still.. I don't have any motivation.. and.. will.. to be here.I don't know how people keep on going. How do they get up in the morning? Why? I just don't see the point.(Oh, and don't worry. I don't plan on doing anything. I've promised not to a long time ago, and I'll stick to that.. Just thinking.. )Looking at the yellow flower on my table. It's pretty, well I would think it is. I can't seem to see it though. It's just there. By itself. On the red table cloth.
