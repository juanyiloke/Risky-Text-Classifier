How Do You Know When You're In Crisis?I wanted to ask this at my therapy appointment on Friday. I didn't. I asked today, but I blabbled on so much that I don't even remember if he answered or what he said.ÊWhat is a crisis?ÊHow do you know when you need to do something dramatic, like being hospitalized or changing everything about your life?I have three modes: "off" (autopilot); "on" (engaged and caretaking of various sorts to the point of exhaustion); and shutdown (in bed, uncommunicative). If I can keep going, I do, one way or another. Or I crash and cannot. Like when I have a high fever. That and when I end up in really bad flashback then dissociation are the only times I really actually cannot keep going. All the other times are choices, which is, I think, lucky for me in some ways...because I can force myself to keep going.ÊIn the past year after my great meltdown, I have tried to find some kind of middle ground. Tried to make choices to care for myself in small ways...make space for myself in the midst of all the chaos. Sometimes it makes me feel better enough that I can soldier on with renewed energy. Now I'm just running on empty.ÊI am not good at asking for help. I hate asking for help, but I have been practicing. And I have trauma therapy 2x per week, psychiatrist 1x month. I'm on this wonderful forum regularly (thank you), I do mindfulness meditation and various forms of yoga practice and journaling every day. I have been doing everything people have recommended. It's just not enough. I am crashing.When you need to scream for help? What does "crisis" mean, really? I mean all the psychotherapist's answering machines say, "If this is an emergency, dial 911." How do you know when something is an emergency? Seriously?
