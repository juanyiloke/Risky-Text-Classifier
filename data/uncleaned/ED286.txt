ÊRedbull addiction:Back at college because I had to work a 40hr+ week and in addition to this do my part time diploma I got into the habit of drinking lots of redbull and caffeine shots.Now I find as my body has gotten so used to it, that I need a redbull every morning to feel energised.ÊBy body has gotten to used to the glucose and caffeine content over many years.I tried weaning myself of redbull, one on one of days then reduce how much I drink, but I find myself constantly going back to it.Thing is I am very active all the time and to keep this up I neck the redbull limit my self to two cans tops a day.
