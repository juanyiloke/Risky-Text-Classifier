I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year, right around the time my psychosis began I started to have alot of really intense dreams every night. Most of them scarry or bizzare, I usually woke up sweating and out of breath. Although I'm thinking clearly now I still have the dreams. Is it like this for you guys?(Examples of dreams I've had: a big explosion I knew was going to happen to the point where I walked away from the building only to turn around to see people burning, a sasquach that killed a bear who was decapitated and had the head of a human, jumping off big cruise ships where people I once loved were trying to help me find my baby and being trapped inside a big clock with a grey haired guy in a lab coat..)ÊKeep in mind the dreams started before I was taking meds and continued while on them and while changing them.What are your dreams like? Would love to hear about them
