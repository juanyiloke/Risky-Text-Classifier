Lonely and angryI've always been lonely but lately I've been getting more and more angry, I feel abandoned by everyone, like a total outcast. I can't make friends and i can barely take care of myself it feels like such an effort just to shower everyday. I know what I have to do but it's so hard just to do it, all I do is sit around daydreaming and listening to music. Can't even be bothered to make a doctors appointment even though I need to and I'm still crying almost everyday. I often feel like hitting people or throwing things I used to be so peaceful too.
