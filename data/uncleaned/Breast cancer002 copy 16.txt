Emotions in turmoil when I should be getting stronger¥	Hi helpful ladies,¥	I was diagnosed with stage 3 BC last June, luckily with no nodal involvement, so have had mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All completed at end of January and now just having three-weekly Herceptin injections (due one tomorrow) until October. The cancer diagnosis came out of the blue and hit me very hard. My problem is my emotions are all over the place! I used to be a strong person, an NHS professional, but have now taken ill-health retirement and am no longer working.¥	I feel stressed and anxious all the time. We've sold our house in Sussex and need to find somewhere to rent in Devon soon, but haven't been to look there yet. Trying to pack everything as well. It all seems too much and I can't sleep more than a few hours at night.¥	I ended up in A/E last week and, when the tests all came back negative, it was implied I had suffered a panic attack - probably true with hindsight, but I did genuinely feel very unwell. No-one knows how panicky and alone I am feeling when I think I should be getting stronger by now.¥	Any tips/help to calm me down and get me through this would be very much appreciated.
