ÊFallingThere was a moment today where I just wanted to do something crazy. I've been zoned out emotionally much of the last few days.I started getting flashbacks. Like fast images flickering across my eyes. Had a sense I was toppling in and out of consciousness and had to step back from the balcony. I don't know why I felt so ghosted as I was full off coffee at the time. A few minutes later I went home and vomited the coffee that was left. I've been purging almost constantly the last few days but only part of my food each time. I feel very dizzy and ill and my glands are inflamed. I don't know what I want in replies. I guess I just want to talk about it and see if anyone has similar experiences.
