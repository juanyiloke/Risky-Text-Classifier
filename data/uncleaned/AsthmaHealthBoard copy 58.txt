Breathing issues________________________________________Quick rundown. I had asthma in my teens, then dissapeared. I smoked from the time I was 17 to last december 2013. Right after I quit smoking, my shortness of breath started. I know this is normal, so I've read. But i'm going on 8 months and NO relief. Every day all day I am short of breath. I feel like i can never get a full breath or air. I sometimes try to yawn to get it, and dont. This leads too my anxiety acting up, which I've had since 1998. I've been given albuterol inhaler and treatment/machine to use every 4 hours. I do this. However, my chest still seems tight. Also, labwork and chest xray clear. I went to ER today with bad attack and was given breathing treatments, three and steroid shot. But as I type this, my chest is still extremely tight. Anyone else experience this? I'm not asking for medical advice or opinions. Just experience and PERSONAL opinions. Thanks guys.
