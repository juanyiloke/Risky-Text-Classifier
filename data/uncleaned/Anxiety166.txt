anybody had hypnosis ? Ê15    I'm going to a appointment tommorow with my new doctors hopefully they will have better advice I have tried cbt meds meditation calming music .I have learnt that when I feel "normal" I freak and then get a symtom.even when I feel ok I turn round and say I feel Dizzy or something just absolutely habbit !.most my conversation with my partner is now how I'm feeling or not feeling ect .My children now worry about little things like cuts ect I'm rubbing off on them they believe they will get infections ect ?still realising this I still haven't changed im sat here now with a "brain tumour /anyrsm " it's like such a selfish thing !So hypnosis seems my only choice if nothing else comes up has anybody had or know anybody that has had it I don't believe in it to be honest but I can only try x
