What your doctor knows about low carbingI went back onto doctors net.com recently to find out what doctors are thinking about the big issues as I see them, i.e. the non impartiality of NICE, the statin scandal, the manipulations by the pharmaceutical industry. (Nothing, by the way, all they are doing is moaning about their working conditions).I contacted an eminent Endocrinologist who was giving continuing education about oral meds in diabetes on the site. I asked him why low carbing was not the first approach. Basically he said most people won't/can't stick to it.From the diabetes fora, I see many, many people sticking to it and why is that not a reason to promote/encourage/educate?What do you folks think?(I don't feel like a traitor telling you all this. I feel I have been let down by the medical profession too. And by the way, they don't have to work 3 day weekends on call as I did.)Liz
