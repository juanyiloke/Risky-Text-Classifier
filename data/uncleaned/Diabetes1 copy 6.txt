18 years old, been referred for diabetes test due to deteriorating eyesight, terrified!Hi everyone,I am an 18 (nearly 19) year old female living in the UK who has not yet been diagnosed (and, fingers crossed, may not even have diabetes), but today was referred to my GP for a diabetes test following an eye exam. Today, I visited an optician because I have been experiencing pain in my right eye for a while. Turns out, the pain is simply eye strain. The back of my eye looks a-okay, so no worries there. My vision has never been perfect, and I wear glasses to read, but I discovered today that my eyesight has deteriorated MASSIVELY since my last eye exam. My last eye exam was in July of 2013. In the two and a bit years since, my vision has deteriorated three fold (or, my prescription has increased three fold). THREE FOLD. Bearing in mind I am only 18, this seems like a massive difference. And, indeed, during the eye exam, when I had to read the letters off the chart, I realised that my distance vision was indeed very poor. Much poorer than I remember it being during my last eye exam. I couldn't even read the big letters off the first chart without squinting!This deterioration in my eyesight concerned the optometrist so much that he referred me to my GP for a diabetes test. I am terrified. My maternal aunt died from diabetes complications. I don't believe that I have any other symptoms, although I have noticed a slight increase in thirst in recent weeks. My question is, is this amount of deterioration in eye sight something I should be concerned about? Did any of you have similar problems with your vision? I am 18 years old, and of a healthy weight. I am somewhat doubtful that I have diabetes, but am still terrified by the possibility. Any advice/reassurance would be greatly appreciated. I will, of course, keep you updated! Fingers crossed all tests come back clear. Thanks,Hannah
