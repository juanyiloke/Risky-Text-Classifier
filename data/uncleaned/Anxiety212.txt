If you could change just one small part of your anxiety experience, what would it be?Do you have one piece of your anxiety experience that is currently, pound for pound, generating the most pain for you? Said another way, if you could change just one small part of your anxiety experience, what would you change?ÊAs an example, I've been recently focused on stopping one thing. When I panic, which happens most days, I often feel like I suddenly have to come up with the RIGHT answer to a bunch of problems RIGHT now like:*should I stay here or should I go*how did I tell myself I'd handle this panic? What's the right method...I can't remember... Arrrggg ...*my future is going to kill me, it is so bad. I need to fix it right NOW. But how?The sensations of panic are difficult, but far worse is this feeling that I suddenly have to solve all these problems and just do everything right, right now, or I'll die. It feels like I am drowning in thoughts. It's as painful as drowning in water.If I could stop the thoughts, or more likely, learn to ride them without responding, just like the feelings, I'd have a much easier time with panic. Also, I would panic a lot less, because it's this feeling of drowning in thought and totally out of control that I fear the most. That fear creates more panic.So I've decided to just focus on that, learning every day how to ride out the thoughts until I've mastered it. Before I was trying to fix too many things at once. Once I feel confident I can surf the thoughts, not struggle, even during worst panic, I'll move on to the next anxiety challenge.ÊSo again, what would you change? What is it for you?ÊI want to know what we anxiety sufferers find the hardest and if it's similar or different depending on the person.Thanks.
