Hello Team,It has been a long time since I put out a post. Today is a day tocelebrate. Today is my 10 year anniversary for completing Testiculartreatment. I also have to share with you all that March 6th, was my 29year anniversary for completing treatment for Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. I ownthis group, CCC a giant thanks for all of your love, support, andfriendships. You have all made me feel welcome and safe to share my fears,hopes, dreams and recovery. I have made life long friendships through theunique connection that we all share. CCC has enriched my life and each andeveryone of you have touched me deeply.I was 22 years old when I was diagnosed with my 1st primary cancer. I neverthought I would see my 25th birthday. Much to my surprise it came and went.My 30th quickly passed as I transitioned back into normalcy. It wasn'tuntil I signed my first 30 year mortgage that I considered that I had along term future ahead of me. In 2002 I was diagnosed with my 2nd primaryand I was back into treatment. I never thought I would see my 50th birthdaybut 2 years ago I celebrated with my friends and family. Today I celebrate10 years and 29 years of survivorship.I cherish the friendships I have made through CCC and I morn the loss ofour dear friends that had to pull out of this race we call life. Thank youfor sharing your lives with me!Chris
