ÊNew to this site and sharing;ÊI have complex PTSD and was in therapy for 3 years for it. I thought the flashbacks would never end the nightmares would never cease but mostly they have not all but because one of my a users has my young sons and continues to abuse us all, I can't fully heal. My counsellor said it's called dv by proxy and ongoing trauma that is totally out of my control. I can only control my reactions to this hell. Some seasons I rise above it with mindfulness therapy I use, somedays I fail miserably, like this last month. Victim again of his cruel ways hurts even more knowing my sons will have probably this and other childhood trauma related mental diagnosis when they are older and realise right from wrong. I had just got to a good place when he was at my door once again. I freeze I'm weak I'm a terrified piece of shit who can't stand up for herself cos I dissociate cos he's a trigger of course. No point involving policnE they discriminated me as crazy the time I reported my kids abuse then year later tried to report another assault to me and they believed his alibi story. I must of punched myself in the face a few times hey?? So nearly Xmas and I'm at anxiety peak and I need to go Xmas shopping but it hurts it's scary just in case I have a freak out in shops and become a frozen person overwhelmed by past memories. But my sons r young and hopefully I get to see them 4 Xmas, I don't know so I have to venture out of my safe locked room and breathe and breathe again. Hopefully one day I'm free of trauma and PTSD symptoms and my boys r safe and free also. I will never heal until they r safe and we finally get justice instead of stigma and degrading illogical discrimination. I'm so isolated here, no family , no close friends just me and the mental health services. Trusting when your so burnt inside is a difficult thing to do.;
