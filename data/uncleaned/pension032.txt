covered facesAfter speaking to a female friend who recently spent a short time in hospital, she got me thinking when during our chat, she said given that many Muslim women must not allow their faces to be seen by anybody other than their husbands, what happens if they are admitted to hospital and the doctor or consultant is male, and needs to carry out or treat other more intimate areas of the body, is it just the face.
