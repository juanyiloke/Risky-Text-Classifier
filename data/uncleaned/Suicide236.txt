 I want to do itI have thought about it for quite a while. My life is not what I want to live. The things I want in life (not material at all) are not possible for me the have anymore and my situation is in a downward spiral. I cant change it. Nothing I do will make a difference at this point. I am not depressed. I have seen counselors and none of them put me on meds at all. They say its just a bad situation and circumstances. Well, they aren't going to change and I refuse to live in a state of mere survival. I'm a giver, and with nothing to offer or give, I am dead already.I have decided to end my life and have thought a lot about how I will do it. I am not depressed. I am just at the end of the road. I have lived my life. I don't want to live the rest of my life suffering. It's time for me to go.
