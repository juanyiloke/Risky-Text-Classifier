Test stripsI have been very naughty and despite only requesting 2 boxes a month I have an embarrassing surplus of test strips that I feel guilty keeping hold of.They are FREESTYLE Optium strips and all in date - if anyone can make better use of them than I am please pm me your address and I will be happy to post them to you. I can spare 6 boxes :/I keep trying to get on board with testing again but only manage a couple of days before my results disappoint me and I stop again. I am reluctant to stop ordering them in case they get stopped completely. I know that I should test being on Glic but believe you me I am nowhere near hypo at all at the moment :/ I have another HbA1c in April.
