starting to recoverAfter everything ive been through that has torn my whole life apart i am finally putting the pieces back together. I havent self harmed for 4 months and i dont want to ever again. I am back in school part time which i am happy with   ive been going everyday. I am trying to get a job and i have started to think about what i would like for my future. I just want to say that i am really proud of myself. Some bad things are happening right now but i find that i am dealing with it a lot better than what i would have 6 months ago. I just want to wish everyone the best and hope they get through it
