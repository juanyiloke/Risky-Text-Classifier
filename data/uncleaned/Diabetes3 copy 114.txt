Should I try harder?Had my eye screening today. No problem, that I am aware of but results in 6 weeks. Met a lady who also has T2. She said her BG is 3.5. Mine seems to have stuck at 5.4 for most of the last year. She takes Metformin twice a day. I don't want to do that and am currently managing on D&E but I am asking myself do I need to try harder to get my level nearer to 4? When it has gone into the 4s I have felt a bit odd. Should I try to get it lower or just be content with where I am?
