ÊHelp me, pleaseHi, I'm new here. Anyway I have several mental health disorders and really I'm trying (and failing) to tackle one issue at a time. So, I eat too much. Whenever I'm offered junk food, I say yes. Plus when no ones at home (my mum and her boyfriend) I cannot stop eating. Every 5 minutes I will be eating. And my mum eats a good amount so I probably eat too much, every single day. I mainly eat when I'm bored and sad, which, with depression is a lot of the time. All of the time. I also have no motivation. And I know I may say this and people will be like: 'To do lists can help.' Or 'Set an alarm for homework or workouts etc.' But I don't think anyone understands (sorry to sound self pitying, but it's true) how much I am unmotivated to do anything. I have slept through school before, I can't keep a workout routine, I can't do my homework. I can't, and I'm not being lazy. I also can't go to the gym because I'm scared of people looking at me. I know these issues are all bleeding into the others, and I'm sorry. I don't have anyone to talk to in real life so sometimes it just happens. I just get so upset because everyone at my school is a healthy weight, and they don't even exercise. They can control their eating. Sometimes I feel like I don't even eat that much but I still can't lose weight.
