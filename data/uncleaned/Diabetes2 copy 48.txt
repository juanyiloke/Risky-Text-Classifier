Requesting for an advise for SPONTANEOUS HYPOGLYCEMIA   Issue: SPONTANEOUS HYPOGLYCEMIAI am writing this, requesting for an advise for my father - 56 yrs old.My father was admitted in hospital in unconscious state due to CBG-24 (no history of diabetics) for past 2.5 weeks he was in hospital . Now he is fine with very frequent meal diet, if not having diet for every 2/3 hrs the CBG level will go down. In blood report shows high insulin and Cpeptide levels. All CTscan/ dotanac scan were normal.Past history:he has undergone total gastrectomy 7 yrs ago. Hence they took multiple scan suspecting insulinoma. But everything was normal.SUSPECT:Doctor also suspect this issue is due to Roux-en-Y procedure (for total gastrectomy), and they prescribed acarbose (100mg) 3-4 times a day. But still no great improvement is noticed.By dec16th 2013, he had a tablet called "VITASURGE" for 15 days which contains Alpha-lipoic-acid (200mg). So doctor suspect it might be Insulin autoimmune syndrome.Kindly advise, if any one gone through the similar case . So far they were not able to diagnose the issue.Regards,Pavi
