Controlled with diet and exercise now taking metformin.Started taking Bydureon then the insurance would not civetover cost so the PDA put me on Byetta which was completely awful. She told me it was just like bydureon except I took 2 shots a day instead of one a week. I stopped it after 2 shots and tried diet and exercise. That worked so well. Numbers were never higher than 130. After about 2 months my numbers went as high as 250. Now I'm taking metformin and my levels are not as good as they should be. Any ideas why this is happening?
