What's the pointHi all, my name is Jacob. For the past couple of weeks, my life has slowly become something that I dread living. First, my grades are ridiculously bad. I study so hard but they don't change. Second, I have to see my ex girlfriend who I still have feelings for every day and have her completely ignore or make fun of everything I say to her. Third, I have no one to talk with about this because my parents don't think it's a big deal and I have no friends. If luck existed I would have the worst of all because everything that happens to me is just bad. Not to mention being picked on by the seniors, having the whole school alienate me because I like to listen to music too much and sit by myself. Anything seems better than what's going on right now. Spring Break is heaven, but it'll end soon and I'll have to dive back in to my shitty life and continue to have these crazy thoughts because one girl shattered my heart and flipped my view on life upside down. Nothing makes me smile or laugh anymore. What's the point?
