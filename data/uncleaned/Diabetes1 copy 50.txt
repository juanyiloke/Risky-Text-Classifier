Test Strips - Complaint Response from the Dept of HealthFolks,I recently made an official complaint to the DOH about my local PCT adopting a policy of non precription for T2's who are not on insulin. The response is below. Pay particular attention to the words I have highlighted in red....Dear Mr Dawson, Thank you for your email of 1 February about the provision of blood glucose testing strips to people with diabetes. I have been asked to reply. The Department of Health is aware that self-testing of blood glucose is an important part of the self-management of diabetes.The guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the management of Type 2 diabetes set out circumstances in which self-testing can be useful, and in these situations it can support people in managing their glucose levels and avoiding hypoglycaemia. The NICE guidelines are also clear, however, that self-monitoring of blood glucose is helpful only as part of an overall package of support for self-care, and it is vital that the results of self-monitoring are fully understood. This means that decisions about self-monitoring should be made on a patient-by-patient basis, and healthcare professionals should work with people with diabetes to make joint decisions about the value of self-monitoring of blood glucose and prescribe accordingly. Any Primary Care Trust (PCT) that is automatically discouraging the prescription of blood glucose testing strips is not acting in accordance with NICEÕs advice.If you have concerns about your treatment in particular then you should discuss them with your GP. You can also contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) for the Solihull Care Trust on 0800 783 2894. This line can provide information and advice about NHS services.I hope this reply is helpful.Yours sincerely,Daniel Cavill Customer Service Centre Department of Health
