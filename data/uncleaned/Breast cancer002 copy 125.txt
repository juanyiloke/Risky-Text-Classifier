Chemo Survival Kit - please read and contribute¥	Hi, George, aka Dreamthief has made some suggestions below to things that work and help during chemo.  I thought it could be helpful to start a new discussion.  Please can you add your comments and suggestions also and I will update the list below and post in April Chemo.  Recommendations on use of these items, brands/where to buy etc would be great too.  Thank you.¥	 1.	Digital thermometer2.	A good chlorhexidine mouthwash.3.	Microwaveable Lavender wheat wrap for arm/vein aches.4.	Manuka Honey5.	Soft toothbrush6.	Ginger Nut Biscuits and/or Ginger Beer to help kick start taste buds.7.	Pineapple cooled in the fridge to help with unpleasantness and stickiness inside mouth.8.	Anti Nausea medication Ð really important to take this before you need it and consistently to keep on top of it.  Try to get medication prescribed before chemo starts.9.	Avoid dairy products the day of treatment and a whilst you feel nauseous -including milk substitutes like almond, rice milk etc. But eat what you feel like, when you feel like it.10.	Mouth Ulcers - make your diet as Alkaline as possible, avoid acid foods such as Oranges, blueberries, cranberries....instead eat melon, kiwi fruit, mango, apples....there are loads if good websites outlining acid/alkaline foods.11.	Rinse out your mouth after meals with bicarbonate of soda.....change to a soft toothbrush, you can gently floss your teeth but don't use dental brushes.12.	Get a gentle PH balanced soap and moisturiser for you skin - moisturise frequently....use rubber gloves for any "wet" work...don't have too many hot showers....drys your skin more..13.	Rest as you need to but exercise as frequently as possible - you might feel knackered but exercise will help battle the fatigue.14.	Don't become a hermit - yes avoid circumstances/people you know to be ill.......but try to live as normal a life as possible.....it helps fight off any emotional side effects.
