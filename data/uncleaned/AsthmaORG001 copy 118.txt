Anxiety I have only been back to work for 3 weeks and during that time chest was getting tighter by the day and when talking feel as if air was getting squished out of me. I've had a horrible past 2 years with my chest, been referred to immunologist because of all infections I get. Had a stressful week last week and had a terrible panic filled weekend. My GP has signed me off work and prescribed diazepam to calm me down, he checked my lungs and they are clear (which I knew anyway). He said stress of work and anxiety is having knock on effect with asthma. Chest is constantly tight and I feel like screaming it is driving me crazy! Peak flow hasn't changed and pulse very fast.Feeling very muddled and fed up at the moment Lisa x
