Christmas PastWhat do you remember of Christmas when you were a kid?For me it was taking the carpets up for a Knee's Up, getting in my Uncles ancient Taxi to go to the Off licence to load up with beer.Doing the Conga along the road in and out of peoples houses and parties.My first sip of rum and blackcurrant.That lovely feeling of having a housefull of family you didnt know and only saw once a year.Coming down after a Christmas party with people sleeping everywhere.Sitting by the coal fire on Boxing day morning with my DadAnd the one thing that strangely sits in my Brain. My mum buying me my first pair of Winklepickers that she wouldnt let me wear untill Christmas day party.and then 2 weeks later, going to school with holes in my left shoe (why always my left shoe) with a piece of cardboard in it.Christmas now just aint the same.
