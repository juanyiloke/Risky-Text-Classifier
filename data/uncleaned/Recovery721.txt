Functioning again!I didn't think I could ever rejoin the workforce again. My panic attacks were out of control. It got so that I couldn't even leave the house or receive visitors.  I was so afraid of having a panic attack that the fear of having a panic attack would make me have a panic attack!!!  In the 1980's it seemed that GPs weren't very aware of symptoms of depression.  After many years of being prescribed sedatives I finally found a GP that recognised my symptoms as 'depression'! Only because his wife had suffered similar symptoms and he'd made it his business to understand it!   I thank God for this doctor even to this day because he set me on a course of treatment that made me feel normal again.  He prescribed some medication for depression.  I told this doctor that I am not depressed.!! . I don't feel sad at all!  He explained that there are multiple 'facets' of depression and that chronic anxiety, panic attacks, obsessiveness, unwelcome thoughts (intrusive thoughts) were all associated with       It and it comes from the brain lacking in certain chemicals  that can be replaced by medication. I asked the dr why I needed these chemical replacements for my brain and he explained that some times people are under  stress for such a long time ( either real or perceived ) that the glands that produce 'seratonin' . ...The stress relieving chemical... Is worn out and can't produce it anymore..it has to have some help to work again.   That's what anti depressants do.   So anyway I'm a 53 year old grandmother now and working and functioning normally only because of the anti depressants I take daily( 30 years now functional!!)al e t
