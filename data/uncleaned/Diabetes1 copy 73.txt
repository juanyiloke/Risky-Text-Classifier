Living alone with type2 diabetes.I'm 52 yrs old & I'm type 2 diabetic. I'm on both tablets & 2 lots of insulin.I take a lot of other medications (43) tablets a day,plus 2 lots of eye drops. The last 15mths I haven't been able to sleep more then 3-4 hrs a nite.I also suffer with a bad knee (waiting to have a op on it) So basically with all these problems i'm having, I am scared because I live alone & I can't afford to eat diabetic healthy, my sugar levels are up & down most of the time(but under control ish) I'm scared that if I have a hypo/hyper it could be days before friends would find me :'( In the last few mths I've put on loads more weight,mainly because I can't walk to far because of my knee & lake of sleep leaving me energy less:-( Can anyone help me with advise? Sorry if it seems I've gone all round the block to tell you what I wanted to, but Im not very good with words or asking for help. But I feel like giving up..... :'(
