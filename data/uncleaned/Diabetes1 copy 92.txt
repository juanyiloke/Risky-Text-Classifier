Why aren't Type 1's being encouraged to use LCHF like Type 2's?Admittedly from a small sample of the Type 1 diabetics who recently attended two sessions discussing a new diabetics service being introduced in Crawley, I was amazed that they were not being encouraged to go onto the LCHF diet to reduce their dependence on insulin and avoid hypo's etc. In fact one of the GPs told me that they were different from me because they need carbs duh! No-one needs loads of carbs in their diet because our bodies can make any carbs they need from the protein we eat. Plus there are several testimonies from Type 1s that I have found on the net including from a practising anaesthetist that the diet allows them to rely on their background insulin. Can anyone explain this division between Type 1s and Type 2s?
