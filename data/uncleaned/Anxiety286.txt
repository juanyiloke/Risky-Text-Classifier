What Worked For Me?Anxiety is hard to overcome. What is even harder is explaining it sometimes. I use to suffer with it daily and very very intensely. One day I remember saying, "I've had enough." and I gave up for awhile. I actually lost my job, and my home and was homeless for about a month and a half. I began searching for ways I could overcome this. However, that proved difficult. To be honest there are days I am still not completely cured, but I am trying. And that is all that matters.ÊI started to meditate. Not only does it have a lot of physical benefits but it also has a lot of mental benefits as well. On top of meditating I began writing. A lot. I have my own blog that I post new thins about 4 or 5 times a week, a journal, and I recently started on a novel. Writing is a pure form of stress-relief.ÊYou can always inbox me if you have questions or even visit my site. (It's on my profile).ÊHope your day is going well!Ê<3 Kayla
