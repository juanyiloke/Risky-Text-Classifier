diabetes diagnosisHello. Ive been reading a lot of posts with people describing how long it took them to be diagnosed as diabetic. Doctor at my surgery just said I had a virus that caused me eyesight to go blurry but that aside, It took a doctor at A&E 30 seconds for me, considering I walked in and gave him a few of the symptons. I spent a couple of hours in rescusatation room while they sorted stuff out then it was a night in a bed on a drip then out by mid day with a box of needles. Ive read some people take months of telling there doctors something is wrong before anything is done. Was wondering how long other took to be diagnosed..
