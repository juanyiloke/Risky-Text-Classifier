Liverpool Pensioners who wouldn't mind being interviewed!Hi there!I am a drama student from Liverpool John Moores University and we are embarking on an epic performance based in the Cunard Building, exploring the history of the building and company and their effects on the city as a whole.It would be amazing if any Liverpool pensioners who used to work for the Cunard Company, in the Cunard building at any time (for any company that has been based there) or in the Maritime industry as a whole wouldn't mind contacting me for a quick interview. I would love to hear your stories of the area and get your insight into this amazing history!If you wouldn't mind being interviewed, or know some who wouldn't, please reply or email me and I would love to arrange a time and place that suits you. I would be eternally grateful!
