Getting asked to buy her a drink... Am I missing something?So, this has happened to me a few times and I'm starting to think I look like an easy mark to scam or whatever. Either that, or I'm missing something.In nightclub at bar buying a round of drinks. Suddenly approached by nice girl, all smiles, eye lashes... etc.Then SHE asks if I'm going to buy her a drink. Then I say "Ha Ha....no" and normally turn back to my friends or maybe just stand there and let awkwardness hang in the sweaty, stale air. Am I right in assuming this is some kind of ploy to get free drinks? I've known none of these girls btw. Just a cold approach and a request for a drink....  Not something I've over analysed before - but its happened a lot recently and I'm starting to think I'm missing some new kind of exploitative flirting trend.
