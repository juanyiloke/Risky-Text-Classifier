Apprehensive and Frightened Well the journey continues, since being diagnosed PSA 9.4 Gleeson 7 T2 in April at the age of 51 I feel as I have been through the whole catalogue of options offered by my local Hospital.I initially selected Brachytherapy only to find out on MRI that the cancer had spread and that this was no longer an option.Having then been refused a RRP operation I managed to convince a surgeon to cary out a robotic procedure only to have the operation abandoned after an hour and a half due to breathing problems. Whilst inside the surgeons reevaluated my prognosis and changed I have now been changed to T3c due to seminal invasion.I am now on hormone therapy Zoladex and due to start 38 sessions of radiotherapy in 3 weeksI ham now struggling with a growing waistline despite daily trips to the gym a total lack of interest in the tro  department and more hot flushes than a transport cafe’s kettle.After all this I am now feeling very apprehensive and frightened about what the future holds
