Anyone know of Individual Therapy on sliding scale- Dallasby lyoung_123 » Sat May 09, 2015 10:58 amMy son was diagnosed with schizophrenia or depression with psychosis. He is trying to get stabilized on medications, but at this point I don't think the resperdal is the right medication for him as he is still seeing things with a vengeance and they appear to be getting more violent. He is on 4mg for about ten days. He has had thoughts of suicide, although he has told me he wouldn't do it. I am trying to get him in to see his psychiatrist sooner as his appointment isn't until May, 26. I am trying to find some psycho therapy for him. I need it to be free or on a sliding scale because I lost my job 2 months ago. I live 40 miles south of Ft. Worth, Texas, but would be willing to drive to get him some help. He needs therapy badly. If anyone knows of someone, please let me know. I am going around circles looking online. Thank you in advance..
