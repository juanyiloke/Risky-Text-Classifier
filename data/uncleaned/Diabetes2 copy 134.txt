Food and odd feelings in brain?Recently, I have noticed when I wait to eat(becoming really hungry) and then eating a lot in a short amount of time, I get this odd feeling. It is very hard to describe. It's like a mental dizzyness and I feel like I need to lay down. My brain feels foggy and the urge to lay down is almost overwhelming. When I do lay down, I am fine after 10 minutes. My dad thinks it has something to do with the sudden rise in blood sugar. Does anybody have any similar symptoms and experiences with this?
