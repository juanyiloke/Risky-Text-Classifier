I have attempted suicide twice in the past year, I am starting to have the same feelings and thoughts that lead me to make the attempts previously. I spend most of my day laying in bed, and as much as I say I will do something that day, I never seem to make that initial step. I failed in the first two attempts, as I didn't want to put my family through the pain of loosing me, but of late I have stopped caring, and just want the pain to go away. I feel so lonely, probably a reason I am on here right now. I am extremely introverted, all of my recent friends I had made over the past 2 years, I have pushed away.Both attempts were through carbon monoxide/ dioxide poisoning. Guns are hard to come by, where I am from....
