Feel a bit scared. Following exacerbation Hi there.I wanted to ask if anyone else, following their first major attack felt scared.I can't shift this fear I have that it's all going to happen again.I have had asthma for many years and while I have blips, and need steroids and increased and altered inhalers, this last week or two has actually freaked me out.On one level I know I'm over reacting, but it also made me realise just have dangerous it can be.Whilst things have improved, I've just finished my second lot of prednisilone, I know I'm not back to normal, and if I do too much I get so out of puff and breathless etc etc.I have this horrible dread of driving to work and having the same thing happen in the car again.Crazy, but don't seem to be able to rationalise this.See my gp tomorrow, so maybe should talk to him but don't want him to think I'm panicking, because I'm not just feeling apprehensive.Has anyone else had similar thought, and any ideas how to deal eith this.Thanks for listening
