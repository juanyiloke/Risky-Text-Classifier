Rambling On Ptsd DiagnosisSo this is probably not going to make sense - it is confusing to me.I have had this diagnosis for decades...figured it was just a label...Criterion A is "the person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence". I meet the criteria ...except there are times, and one of them is now, when I just can't believe that I meet the criterion...except that...because...well...I didn't die (except that I thought I would... "Holy Crap...he's going to kill me this time, arms protecting head, worried about the gut are as he's kicking me...or the knife...or...)...and the sexual violence part...well, I have always just called it a misunderstanding. Evidence...bruises, broken bones, blackened eyes...not important. There's this cognitive dissonance thing going on. I don't know, maybe because I'm finally addressing it with a therapist who is trained to do trauma work. I know it's there, I know what happened, there are no repressed memories (or if there are, I don't remember them ). I know what I felt, I know the terror...and yet, I feel like it's someone else, like it's no big deal, like I'm making too much of it. But I am NOT that person...I am not someone who that could have happened to...I am not..I don't have symptoms unless I'm addressing the trauma or I'm "triggered"...(I do get that this is ironic - but I'm kind of serious here)....I suppose it's denial...and I don't know what I'm asking for...maybe just someone to explain to me what this is...or to just say they understand...
