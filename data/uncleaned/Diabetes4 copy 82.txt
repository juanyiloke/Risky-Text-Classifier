Interstitial fluiddoes anyone know if the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid is likely to vary throughout body parts or remain similar?The reason I ask is that the libre is factory calibrated and only approved for use in the back of the arm. Presumably because they only tested it there. My current sensor ends tomorrow night and has been really accurate in the back of my arm. I am not putting a new one in straight away but when I do I am tempted to experiment with a different site. Between the top and outside of my upper thigh. I understand this is not recommended by abbot etc etc. Is there any known reason why blood flow or glucose concentration in interstitial fluid in the thigh would be significantly different to in the back of the upper arm?
