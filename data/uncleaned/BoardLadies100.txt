Hard to find cervix during smearHi ladies, I just had my smear test done and the nurse had to do it four times. It was so uncomfortable, she said she couldn't see my cervix and got me to get into a different position. At the fourth attempt she found it and wasn't sure she had taken enough of a swab.ÊI got my first smear 3 years ago and it's was perfectly normal, first attempt. The results from it were that I had a bacterial vagenous and it cleared up.ÊWhy would my cervix be hard to find, I am overweight would that have something to do with it? I will be trying for children soon and am just feeling really anxious.ÊThanks all x
