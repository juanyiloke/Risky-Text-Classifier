feeling absolutely miserabletoday's been really hard, even though I managed to do one of my uni presentations this morning which was really good, and now I only have one more thing to do (tomorrow) until exams at the end of may, which is great, I've made it through the entire three years almostbut today has just been so hard, my IBS has been acting up horribly and I've felt horrible, am hating the diarrhoea, and worst of all my mum has a mammogram tomorrow because she felt a lump a few weeks ago and she has had DCIS (stage 0 breast cancer) before so it's a huge worryshe had a mammogram less than a year ago which came back as all clear and she had radiotherapy which is meant to decrease the chance of recurrence, so i'm just praying and hoping it's cysts, but i've managed to convince myself that my mother's dying, and idk how to stop that
