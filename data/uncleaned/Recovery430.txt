  The real me!I never thought I'd ever have anything to write in this section, I never thought it was possible to get better, but I have! I found the righttherapy for me even though I have to pay for it, but it works!I have done a complete 180 in the last couple of months! I find  I catch myself smiling randomly because I know I'm not depressed  anymore! And although my situation in life  at the moment is not the greatest, I'm the happiest I've ever been and I feel like the real me is here to stay!I feel like a light has filled me up! I want to use it tohelp  others.I have recently seen a psychologist and have been deemed clinically sane! she's going to review  me in January but she believes that I'm better and that I wont need anymore help.For years I've been wondering what's the point? why do I have to suffer  so much and why should I carry on? The answer is there is always something to be glad about in any given situation no matter how shit it is. If life throws you lemons then throw them back as hard as you possibly can and move on! Anyone who goes through so much shit in their lives deserves the chance to be happy  and when they reach that point when that turn around happens it's the best  feeling in the world because you've been through all the crap you are now equipped to deal with what ever comes your way because you know THERE IS light at the end of the tunnel and you'll be happier than anyone who hasn't been through all the shit you have been through because you know what it's like to be that low and that you can get through it no matter what. I tell you this if I can do it anyone can bloody well do it!   Love to all on TTL because you are all worth caring about!
