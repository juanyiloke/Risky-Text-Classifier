 Do you talk details?Hi all I'm just wondering other people's stories in talking in therapy. When sharing about your past abuses do you explain to T the event, details etc? There is one thing to say this (over arching statement) happened to me vs this (detailed explaination, with emotions) happened to me. I guess I'm trying to work out how to talk about my past issues, some of it I have gone in to details. This made me feel a whole lot - better and far worse - but was nice that someone other than me knew what happened. There are events that I want tell T about and I say I want to talk about it - and I do, but I also can't get the words and everything out.How much detail do you go in to? And why can't I just blurt it out!Thanks for listening to my confusing post
