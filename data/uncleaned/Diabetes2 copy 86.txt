My practice nurse says my HbA1c (6.5) is very good, but...   My type II diabetes is being kept under control through diet and exercise. I'm 64 years of age, male. I asked her about medications, side effects and effect on car driving. She said that it wasn't a question of if, but when I need to go on medication, e.g. metformin. I asked whether the HbA1c value only ever gets worse over time and she said, yes, it never stabilises at one figure. And once it reaches 7.0, then it's time for the meds.However, she did say I was doing extremely well with diet/exercise control, since most patients with borderline diabetes type II were on meds within a year of diagnosis. I am now in my third year since diagnosis.Any comments about the above, especially with regard to the long-term prognosis of the biannual HbA1c tests, would be welcome.
