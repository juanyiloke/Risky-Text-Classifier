Her.ie .... disappointing websiteI started reading joe.ie when my brother would send me funny links/stories..So I was quite hopeful & optimistic that her.ie would be like joe.ie but obviously with a female slant..Holy moly.. it's terrible!Clever people behind it, I know that. They're paying about ten staff (if not more) so are making millions from advertising revenue but Jaysus... could they not come up with some original content?!Everything on it comes from the dailymail or the journal (usually about three hours after the original source)And they rely heaving on people sending in 'tips'Ê'Look at my son falling off a horse, hilarious' type videos.. and general drivel..How long can their bubble last!?!?!?And they're always deleting opinionated comments..Jesus Wept
