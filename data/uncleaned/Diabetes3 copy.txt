fruity problemsHello everyone and thanks to all for the warm welcome. I am in need of advice re fruit. I am unsure of which fruits should be avoided or restricted. I was told by the nurse at my surgery not to mix fruits but to only have two small portions of fruit a day, eaten at different points during the day. Further I should avoid pineapple, melon and banannas. I have been restricting my fruit intake to apples, oranges, blackberries but would like other options. Please excuse typo errors as I tend to type really fast. Please could I get some advice. Thanks from bigbirdy. LOL
