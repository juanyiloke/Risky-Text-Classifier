 Hullo, People ..... I can't believe it's taken me this long to find this place! For years now, I've not discussed my PTSD with anyone. I usually become enraged, when some doughnut starts a thread about PTSD on the General Chat board of any forum. Because, it always swiftly fills up with 'Experts' on the subject. None of which actually have it!I've had it for years now. About as long as I've had a computer. And only last bloody night did it finally dawn on me to type " PTSD Forum " into Google!  I mean, there's thick. There's totally retarded. Then there's me! Anyway, I found several. Just looked them over. This looks like the one I'll fit best with. God, the relief! An entire, very active forum full of people who know Exactly what it's like! Just unbelievable! Right; I'm off, to level out again. I'll be back presently. I see I have seventeen pages to look through. That'll set me off! Bet I'm in for a truly great time! Finding this place has just made my life that little bit more complete. Now, I no longer need to be the only person in my world who knows what the hell goes on inside my head
