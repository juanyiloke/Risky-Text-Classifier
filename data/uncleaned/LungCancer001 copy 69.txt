There is no evidence for pulmonary embolic disease. The thoracic aorta is intact.There is no pleural or pericardial fluid .There are shotty axillary nodes. There is a 1.1 cm right hilar node maybe reactive .There are no focal consolidations . There are no sighns of pneumothorax. There are bullous changes in the upper lobes more significant on the right than on the left .There now sending me to a Pulmonary Specialist .I also have Nodes in groin , and neck . Some are the size of a quarter down to a dime in size . No fever although i always seem to be sweating . Loss of weight , about 10 lbs in 2 months . Most likely due to the fact i can't eat much without feeling full or bloated .Just nervous as i have a 7 year old little girl , who i love dearly and don't want to leave her anytime soon .
