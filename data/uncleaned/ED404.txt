ÊSo I'm trying to lose some weight againFound myself watching some 'thinspo' and 'fitspo' videos on youtube last night- because I kep trying to eat healthy and then have all these late night snacks- I used to be heavier- lost 30 pounds and have stayed the same now for over a year. I guess that's a good accomplishment, but I want a fit stomach(something I've never had and always suck in my gut/flex my stomach muscles in public) ) I'm at like 29 BMI, which is the low side of overweight, soI could stand to lose another 15-20 lbs - people tend to think I weigh less than I do because of my height, but I want to have the willpower to eat healthy all the time and get back into a regular exercise regime. I feel like I'm semi starving myself- that's how I originally lost the 30 pounds- semi starving myself and exercising- losing weight has always been hard, as I am an emotional eater by nature.
