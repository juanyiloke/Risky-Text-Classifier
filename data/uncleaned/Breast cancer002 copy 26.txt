Waiting for biopsy result¥	Eight years ago I had tonsil cancer and am already involved with the head and neck cancer group on here. I have successfully survived that however the scare of cancer and all I went through the first time has had the effect of stopping me from examining other parts of my body and now I have a breast lump. I dont know how long it has been there and I am petrified that it has been there a long time and could have spread so much it is untreatable. This week I went to the hospital and they did a cone biopsy and I get the results next Thursday. They couldnt say for certain what it was until they get the tests back but having been here once I am scared and cant believe I can get cancer twice. I would just be grateful for any words of support at the moment. I have had huge support from this community for my first cancer. I know I am thinking the worst but I watched it all on the ultrasound and it looked awful.
