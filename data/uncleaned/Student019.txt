 Is it possible to get a First Class Degree if you get 2:2 in your Second Year?by SilverPenguin777Hi,I basically just wondered if it is possible to get a First Class Degree if you score a 2:2 in your second year if your Second Year is worth 33 percent of your overall mark and Third Year is worth 66 %? Are we talking about getting a First in every module to reach this goal? I scored a 2:1 in my first year, but it looks like I'm heading for a 2:2 this year, due to lack of motivation etc. Please be kind to me in your answers if this is a very simple Math question. I am obviously not doing a Mathematics degree
