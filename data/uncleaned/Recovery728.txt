Overcoming mental illnessHey folks! Hope your all doing just fine.I was kinda struggling for few days so thought I should join these forums and see if I could get any good advise.I have been clinically diagnosed with "Schizophrenia" over 8 months ago. I was suicidal at the time. Was lucky my friends noticed my behavior and told me seek help and i did. Never done drugs in my life, the Pysch says its  hereditary. My grandfather had mental illness and somehow i got it.  So have been on meds ever since. Overtime I come to realise that i was really ill  and needed to keep taking the medications.The doctor says I have "stabilized" and in recovery. I still struggle with hearing "voices" as they are all nasty in nature. Its like I am on the streets on a leisurely walk and these random people call me a freak or disgusting etc. I used to wonder perhaps everyone heard these voices and we just had to learn to develop "thick skin". Meds are helping though so. The Psych told me meds wont take away all the voices. I called the hospital the other day. They said you could start working on improving your self esteem. I am also very self critical by nature so I am known to be very hard on myself. I joined the Gym and been working out heaps but wherever i go the voices remain. These voices can be very discouraging. Its like you vs world all the time. What would you do if you were in my shoes?I am just looking for change of perspective. I have begun looking for work. Some days I am full of energy wanna achieve things and other days it overwhelms me! I know mental illness is work in progress, you go one day at a time. I am grateful though overtime was able to overcome the victim mentality which was the suicidal part of me. If you folks got any advise for me on how to approach things differently please let me know. I am willing to do whatever it takes to overcome mental illness. I am still young and life's too short anyway.
