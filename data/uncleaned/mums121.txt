Y7 dd learned today that a classmate had self-harmed quite severely. She (dd) is deeply disturbed by this. What can I say or do to comfort and reassure her?She also wants to give this child a hug, but feels that might be a bit weird. They're not especially friends, just classmates that get on, but with little in common other than being in the same sets for some subjects. Is there anything she could do? I have suggested that she continues treating this person as if they were ordinary, not in any way strange, frightening, or fragile.
