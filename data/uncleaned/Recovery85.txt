Does Music Help You?Music is a very major part of my life, I'm always listening to something. I listen to every genre and such, pretty much anything with lyrics I can relate to.Hope this is in the right spot.But yeah.. I was curious how music and such helped anyone else.I wouldn't be part of the man I am today if it wasn't for a band called 'Senses Failed'.Lyrics just describe a lot points in my life, high and low. Drunk or sober.It's helped me cope and still does.I don't know what I'd personally do without it.Feel free to post bands, lyrics and such and just talk about something other than the problems we may face and instead something that calms us. (Well me, that I know of.)- Phil
