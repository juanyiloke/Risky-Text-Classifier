Sharing my experience battling Obesity - Diagnosed Type IISome people will understand, some people may even appreciate the gesture, and some folks may be disgusted or have jokes at my expense, but if I can share my story online and influence even one person’s life and health in a positive way; I’ll take that as my way of contributing and paying it forward. I am not a wordsmith by any means, but I took a stab at writing a blog to highlight my battles with obesity and diabetes and outlined some of the things I did to turn my life and health around.I also want to warn folks up front, the second page is untouched photos of my current physical condition to illustrate what losing over 165 pounds can look like (well for me anyways illustrating my current body weight and physical state). So visit that page at your own discretion but you've been forewarned.
