Can anyone offer advice/support? worried sudden asthma attacks Hi, I'm new and looking for advice. sorry for the long post in advance! I've had asthma now for about 8 years. For the majority of this time it has been poorly controlled due to a number of reasons. To cut a long story short I recently had a flare up first week of December which resulted in me having fast onset of symptoms and having to use my nebuliser and the usual steriods to get it under control. I was chesty but feeling better by Christmas. However, on 28th Jan I was at work and had a sudden attack. I was given neb by paramedics and taken to hospital but came home same night to self medicate and see my own doc. It took a month of steriods, nebs and antibiotics to get better. I also started taking fostair as a new preventer. That's my background but the main reason for posting is that the last episode in particular has left me feeling slightly paranoid about my asthma kicking off again. I have a 2 year old so taking things easy is difficult and my job involves a lot of talking/singing so feel down when I can't function like I should. I find it difficult to talk to family as they don't seem to appreciate how quickly I can get out of control and I don't wheeze so if anything go very quiet when asthma's bad. My husbands great but works and can't be there to help all the time and I hate putting pressure on him. I do have had periods where I can have no symptoms at all but this winter has really been difficult. Here's the question - would I sound stupid to mention to the doc how I'm feeling? He's generally very good but I guess it's me not wanting to ask for help as not sure if I'd be told to pull it together and it's not that bad?! Anyone else ever felt like this? Thanks for listening!
