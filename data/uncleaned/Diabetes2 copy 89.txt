Diabetic neuropathy   I am a 78 year old late onset Type 1 DM diagnosed in 1999. In the last year or two I have developed sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. I am surprised by the NICE selection of medications, all of which were developed for other conditions and are effectively recommended \&quot;off label\&quot;. Tramadol can mask intimations of hypoglycemia.By internet searching I have discovered C-peptide and aldose reductase inhibitors (eg Epalrestat). I have bought a gram of C-peptide (2 years supply) from China, fully certified, and have been using it for 3 months now. My deterioration has stopped and there are improvements in foot and leg sensation. However it does involve about 6 extra jabs/day.I am currently considering adding (oral) Epalrestat, which has a different mode of action.I think your page ought to mention that there are these specific remedies even if NICE has not yet approved them. People like me may wish to try them at their own risk (weighed against the risk of NOT trying them!) and the resulta are useful to us all.[/b]
