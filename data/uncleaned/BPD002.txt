Using food and drugs to fill the emptinessby juniper2015 » Sun Jun 14, 2015 4:56 amI use people to fill the emptiness, which craves love and acceptance. I've known this for some time, but it's kind of struck me that when I start feeling empty and lonely, I get cravings for food (hungry or not), and barring that, cravings for drugs.I have an ED and problems with substance abuse, but starting to see the pattern with the emptiness and those cravings. It's subtle but starting to see the connection.I know it is common for borderlines to have issues with substance abuse (not saying all do though), just wondering if others experience the same and see a connection between it and the emptiness?I managed to stay sober for 3 months until a week and a half ago and I admit if I had the money I'd get some more right now.I've been trying to self-validate more and rely less on the external to fill the need, but most of the time it does little for me.
