  Brighter Days AheadI've beenfeeling better  recently- everything's far from perfect, of course, but I can almost physically feel my depression lightening. I'm fortunate enough not to have been plagued with depression for my entire life- mind, I'm a bundle of nerves with all sorts of anxiety issues that I have to live with for the rest of my life, but a few weeks ago, a traumatic incident sent me spiralling into a deep depression that clouded my focus and prevented me from dealing with my usual anxiety problems effectively. Since I've been home from university, every day  was been a struggle, menial chores that were irritating at best suddently became almost impossibly arduous, and I seemed numb to every feeling other than sadness, fear, and worthlessness. I just sort of trudged through each day because I didn't know what else to do. It seemed that there was no way out.My father, bless him, encouraged me by telling me that the most dangerous thing man  can do is stand still, and that even if you don't ride out of the dark  place you're going through before nightfall, you must keep at it because you can know with certaintly that eventually, day will dawn, and light the way for the journey that remains. I'm not sure I'm completely off of the dark, treacherous road from his story yet, but its end is definitely in site, and I feel like the clouds of my depression have cleared, allowing me to see and navigate the remaining obstacles with a much surer step. Even though I've had a few issues with my anxiety today, whilst before they felt like devastating failures, they've now just seemed like minor setbacks. I'm feeling confident that my future will set itself to rights again, and in the meantime, I have my amazing, supportive father and an incredible lad to whom I'm betrothed to help me finish sorting through this.
