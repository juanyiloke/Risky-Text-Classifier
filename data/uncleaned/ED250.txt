ÊNever hungry, always force my self to eat.Read around this forum a little bit and tried to google for an answer. Lately I have started noticing that I'm not a tid bit hungry, ever. I could go on for a long time until I stop and think, hang on a second, I haven't actually eaten anything at all today.. better get something. I pretty much force my self to eat at least 3 full meals a day because apparently that's normal and what one should do. I'm having dinner right now and it's now cold because it's been sat here, in front of me, for about an hour. I slowly pick on it until the plate is empty. I suppose this doesn't bother me as much as it should since my weight is where it's supposed to be, I exercise regularly and feel pretty damn healthy. Nonetheless, should I be worried?
