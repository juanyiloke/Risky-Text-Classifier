Just started getting Asthma (am pretty worried)________________________________________Hi all,This is uncharted territory for me. The feelings are none I've ever had before, and it's pretty scary. This all started probably a month ago. Periodically, when I had to do something strenuous, I would kind of get asthmatic symptoms. Everything started to amplify when I started school - The start of the semester meant (and means) horrible parking, which means having to walk long distances.Although I occasionally have a cough, the main symptom is just the shortness of breath. I saw a doctor a few days ago, who just did a rudimentary test on me - Didn't find anything at the time (which makes sense, because I was feeling fine, at the time, and didn't strain myself physically). He prescribed Albuterol, and QVar. The latter, I did not yet get, as the cost is so high, although I will probably get it at Costco (cheaper).I had success with Albuterol the first time I used it, and then it's been more spotty (i.e. feel like my right lung is open, while my left is not, or less so). What's strange is that I kind of feel like I've had a few more symptoms/episodes after starting to take Albuterol.Anyway, would appreciate the guidance from those who have more experience with this.Thanks.
