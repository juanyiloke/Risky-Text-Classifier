pain around hemicolectomy scarJust wondered if anyone on here can comment.In the last 2-3 weeks I've been getting pain around my scar from my hemicolectomy. I have a nice 6-8 inch one on the right side of my abdomen running to just above my tummy button, (it goes across not down). The skin below the scar has been numb since my op, which was 10 months ago. I now get a pain around my scar when I move about. Could it be from nerves just getting back together, even after all this time or something worse like a hernia? (I don't think it's the cancer as it's in the wrong place.)
