Peak flow down________________________________________My peak flow best is 400, and normally is around 300 plus or minus 10-20 points. Ever since I walked through a cloud of cigarette smoke yesterday, it's hovering in the low range, although not quite to the red zone. And of course, it tends to get worse at night, after office hours. Don't really want to keep hitting the rescue inhaler as much as I have. Do you think if I wait it out it will gradually get back to a normal range, or should I break down and seek medical attention tomorrow? Still trying to learn how to manage asthma and what my personal limits are. Thanks!
