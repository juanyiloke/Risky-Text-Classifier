I think I might have BEDI am 17, I am a healthy weight but I have this really bad problem. I have been binging 1-3 times every day and I cannot stop. It's impossible. For example in the past hour I have ate[list removed]And I am still hungry and I am really craving some sweets or fast food.... I feel so useless. I think I need help. I've always had troubles with my body image and food since I was 13. I tried to go on diets when I was 13 to lose a couple of pounds, but I failed every time and if anything, I've gained weight. I've just hated food since then.... but I can't stop eating it. I haven't tried restricting or dieting for probably a year or more. When I think of eating vegetables it just bores me, I feel like without sweets every day there is nothing to look forward to. I could really use an advice and a friend or someone who is going through the same thing. I think it's gotten really bad in the past 2 weeks because I am having exams soon and I am really nervous, but the more I eat the more I procrastinate studying. HELP ME PLEASE
