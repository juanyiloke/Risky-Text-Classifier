Little ConcernedHi All, Sorry for bothering you all on this lovely sunny day (well here in Wiltshire anyway!)I'm a type 2 diabetic, who has been controlling things very well through diet, however in the last 8+ weeks I've been more and more tired, I've been putting on weight (again! Grrr) and feeling generally really unwell. I spoke to my Dr's surgery on Tuesday who had me in for an 'emergency' appointment. They are sending me for blood tests, but not until next Thursday as they didn't have any appointments   and then I have a Dr's appointment booked for the end of the month. The generally thinking was that maybe the big D is getting worse, but I am struggling to find any information on this, but HbA1c results have always been good, last one was 6.7 so I'm confused as how it could suddenly get bad!I guess I am just after some words of wisdom or personal experiences of people who have controlled with diet and then ended up on meds.They are also testing for thyroid problems and I realise I can't do to much until I have the test and the results come through. But I am just so fed up of feeling tired and under the weather.Thanks in advance all
