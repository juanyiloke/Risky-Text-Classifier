S.E.R.P.SCan anyone explain in simple terms : How do they work out how much second state pension you are entitled to, I know its basedon how much money you earned during your working life, is there a simple formula for working it out so that you have some ideahow much you may get without asking for a pension forecast. Also how the contracting out system works  ( I was contracted outfor eighteen years). I'm told I'm too near to retirement to get a forecast anyway. Also how long S.E.R.P.S. has been running?Thanks in advance, I hope someone can help.                                                                 Tom.
