Changing University. Help?by Dan1803Hi, I’m currently studying in my first year at University. I’m looking to change university due to being pretty unhappy with how my first year is gone, and what I anticipated University to be like. My campus is very small, and disconnected from the main campus, the town is pretty dull so I find myself bored during my free time, plus I’m pretty far away from my family back home.Anyway, I want to change courses (sports journalism to journalism) but that will probably mean I have to start the first year again in September. I’ve called up a few unis today that I liked the look of and they said apply through UCAS, I’ve just checked the UCAS website and they say the deadline for the UCAS applications is the 15th January. At around that time, I didn’t think I would want to be moving university.I don’t want to reapply and go next year (2016) as I’ll be years above the other 1st year students. Is there any way that I can study a journalism course in September 2015??PLEASE HELP!
