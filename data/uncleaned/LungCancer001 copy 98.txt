2 year plus survivors post here pleaseI am always inspired and uplifted hearing of those who have fared better then the death sentence this disease is viewed as. It is especially nice to know in spite of the type and stage we are diagnosed with, we have hope to live longer and find treatments that have helped for others. Thanks for sharing, I know first hand it is often painful to talk about. And don't fret about rambling, it helps.
