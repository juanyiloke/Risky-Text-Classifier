Autumn! And symptoms________________________________________I normally love autumn! But the first cold day here came with bad chest pain and breathlessness all day.Not that I haven't had plenty of bad days. Diagnosed about March and asthma still not in control. Dr (polmonologist) really wasn't sure I had asthma because the meds were not controlling it . But Friday was somehow different. Assume the cold air got to me. Though have to admit I ran out of Montelukast tabs couple days ago. Didn't renew because Doc and I had decided I would go off meds to see what happens.I am on Dulera, Nebulizer x3 a day ( Albuterol) antihistamines, decongestants . Musinex ,a nasal spray . Have been on Predisone three courses sense this began. Had a echocardiogram recently and have dr appointment this coming Friday the 7 th .Expect my heart to be fine as the stress test went so very well. Does the Echocardiogram show any problems with lungs or is it all about the heart? I don't think there are any more tests to give me. My doctor last time said he now believes it is asthma. Why I am not feeling better he does not know. I am very tired of not breathing right every day. He also did blood tests for allergies and says I don't have any!! That all this time it has been asthma misdiagnosed! Can't wrap my mind around that! What about my sinus headaches? Sneezing Dry eyes? And such? Thanks for reading if anyone has any word of wisdom please share.
