How to be calm and collective in speaking when under pressure?2012-12-26, 02:16 PMI notice one of the hiccups I have is that under pressure when speaking, I tend to have a small lisp and my words don’t come out properly. This is most likely because I want to be able to share so much but at the same time become overwhelmed in what I have to say. Often times if I’m upset or angry I kind of tend to not be as calm or collective, I’m afraid that I might miss my opportunity to explain all the details involved.I was wondering, what is the best method to learn and improve my overall speaking skills when confronted with pressure?
