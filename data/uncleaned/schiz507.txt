ÊIntrusive thoughts + psychosisI have been getting pretty bad intrusive thoughts, and I'm certain that they are a result of hearing voices because everything I hear is always negative or threatening, and it ends up giving me negative and unwanted thoughts.ÊNot to mention, am almost certain that someone can see my thoughts, because the negative thoughts that I get are immediately followed by negative comments in another person's voice (which has been the same voice the whole time I've experienced psychosis).ÊNo medicine has been effective in putting a stop to the voices, which leads me to believe that they're real and somebody is doing this on purpose to me.ÊWhatever I look at, the voices can either read to me, or explain in great detail, without me even thinking anything.So all in all, I believe that I'm being spied on, having my thoughts listened to, and having them seen by someone.They have all been too real, and in too much detail to be my own voice.Someone with a similar experience or knowledge care to help/exlpain?
