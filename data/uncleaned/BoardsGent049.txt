Anyone else have difficulty finding clothes that fit?I'm on the big side of small. When it comes to t-shirts, hoodies and jackets, I'm too big for the small but too small for the medium. It can be difficult to find chinos and jeans in the right size too. I've noticed in any shops I've been to the shortest leg length is 29. Thankfully that's just about right for me but if I was a couple of inches shorter I'd be fcuked. I haven't seen any shorter than that anywhere. Even when it comes to belts I usually have to cut a hole in between 2 holes to get the right fit.
