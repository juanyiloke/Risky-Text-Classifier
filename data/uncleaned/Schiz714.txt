ÊHere is my storyMy name is Mariana I have been recently (last year) diagnosed with schizophrenia My parents had to move so we lost our previous doctor and my father now has new health insurance that won't cover me for my mental health it only covers him. I need my meds but I can't get a job because I can't function well enough to I tried applying for disability but I have not heard back anything yet from them. I was taking risperdal but now I have no meds. I wanted to ask if there is any way to get risperdal without a prescription maybe? I have been scared I keep having episodes of psychosis when I go into psychosis I believe I am a alien/human hybrid or experiment that was placed on this earth to do good for humanity and there are people out to get me because they want to keep me from helping others I experience brain trailing where I link together current events or things I hear and see as messages to me for what my next mission should be. It is very hard for me to accept that this is not really happening because I feel that thinking those thoughts are what my enemies want me to do and they will succeed in preventing me from helping the world if I give in to thinking this is not real.I have had these delusions and I have had schizophrenia from the age of 15 up until now I am currently 22 years old. I was at first wrongly diagnosed with bi polar and anxiety disorder by my first doctor who was no help and should not have been a doctor I then had a good doctor for a short while who told me he new exactly what was wrong with me and diagnosed me with Schizophrenia. While on Risperdal I hardly heard voices or saw beings at all and my psychotic episodes were not nearly as prominent as they used to be.I don't know what to do or where to go or how to get my medications right now. I saw these online pharmasies that claim to mail you medication without prescription I don't however know if its a scam or not.. what should I do?
