Topic:ÊCan't keep my head above water anymoreÊCancelI just feel so tired of trying to keep everything together. I have suffered from Major Depression, Complex PTSD and OCD. I'm doing everything that everyone wants me to do but it isn't changing anything. I get home every night and am so exhausting from wearing a mask every minute of the day. I get home and I just fall apart. I just can't help but feel like I have been fighting for so long that I have just reached the end...I feel so scared and alone!Êi don't have anyone to turn to that isn't a medical professional. I'm so lost! Im not sure that I can keep up the charade for much longer!
