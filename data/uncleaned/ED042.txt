Quite The ContradictionI wasn't really hungry today, but I still binged. My therapist, while she doesn't know if I have an eating disorder, but many other therapists say I do. Another thing, I hate people telling me how to eat, telling me when to face the scale, or anything else that has to do with my numbers, or even my eating. I continue to fight with my doctor about the numbers because I, "know how much I weigh,Ó well, you know how those arguments go, and I don't allow my doctors to speak to one another, nor do I allow my doctors to speak to any of the therapists I've ever had, not even when I have multiple therapists do I let them speak to each other about me.While I am paranoid sometimes from my delusions, I really do suffer from something, and I don't know why I don't want my therapist to hear about my past history, even if it's far back, or even recent. I mean, who wants someone to be troubled about their life 24/7 on the brainwave channel, and who knows what she thinks about me and quite frankly, I never cared.My parents think I'm too afraid to get help, and they're right. I don't want my parents talking to my doctors, nor do I want them talking to my therapists.Without anymore options, I know I can't run forever, and I've decided to give in to societal pressure, the one that universally, "helps us heal," they say, but I recovered from some other things without the help of my parents, and I guess it relates to why I have these problems now: I guess my problems back then have replaced themselves with a problem just as deadly, and I am going to do something about it.Wish me luck, bye!
