How much clothes do you own?Just got thinking about this after seeing the "what do you wear on a night out?" thread.. Some people seem to have loads, but most guys I know don't seem to be in the slightest bit worried about clothes or fashion.I am honestly not in the slightest bit fussy or worried about what I'm wearing, unless I'm going to something formal. All I own is 3 hoodies, 3 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of chinos, 7 t-shirts and 1 shirt. I have three pairs of shoes; one fancy/formal pair, a pair of Adidas I've worn everyday for the past year, and a shite pair of runners that I'll use to avoid ruining my normal pair if I ever do anything that involves getting muddy/wet (hurr hurr) etc.There's one guy in particular I know who has an absolutely massive collection of clothes, fancy stuff too, don't even know if he ever wears the same thing twice. He told me he has about 20 pairs of jeans, 10 pairs of chinos, about 50 t-shirts, 30 shirts, 20 hoodies and 15 pairs of shoes. Why would you need that much?  Is that a normal amount? I couldn't justify having that much clothes simply because of the money it would cost  It'd feel like a waste to me.How about you?
