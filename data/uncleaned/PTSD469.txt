Ê"Back to the future"So, I was wondering if anyone else feels like with trauma, your life has been come totally off pass as in way it was "never supposed to go" and now you are stuck in this totally "wrong" parallel reality.I watched the movie Back to the Future from the 80s a few days ago andin some scene they draw a timeline with present, past and futureand then a sharp line downwards representing a cut with a crucial event that then leads to a different and changed reality in the future, that so comes of the path of the "real" timeline.I got really excited when I saw that because I thought "this is exactly how I felt with trauma!!"Like my life was this clean line of things that happened and how things were supposed to go, in the future, with me growing up, getting a good job and getting married with my parents still there at my side etc etc. having my family etcAnd then when my father died, I feel like my life-time-line got a cut into a different reality where it never was supposed to go, and that caused a chain-reaction of a bunch of things that then led me to this "changed" reality where I was never supposed to end up at, that is "all wrong".I actually found the perfect picture, here:http://keyholegame.com/wp-content/up...Chalkboard.pngThis is how I used to feel, like something somewhere went terrible wrong that sent me into this other reality.ÊNow, I feel less strange about it, less freaked out, less unnormal, because i do know that these things "can" happen. However, I still sometimes more or less tend to feel this way. And I was wondering if this is how other people feel too?
