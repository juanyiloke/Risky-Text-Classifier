Why The DifferenceYesterday I had a fair journey to make about 300 mile round trip, just about a tankful, so on Saturday I filled up with diesel at Tesco in Ilminster £141.9 per liter and off we went.Having a good run home and with time to spare our lass wanted to pop into her friends who live in Yeovil about 12 miles from Ilminster, passing Tesco in Ilminster I see diesel at 136.5 over 26 pence per gallon cheaper or as in my case about £3.90 more per tank and still £141.9 per liter in Ilminster.A case of a "Every Little Helps Tesco" rip off.............................
