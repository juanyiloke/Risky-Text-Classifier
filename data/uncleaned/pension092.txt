Airline Baggage AllowanceI have always taken great care not to go any near my maximum allowance as each kg can cost at least £8 a kg at the airport. So I paid £10 for an extra 3 kg giving me a maximum of 23kg. Going out from Birmingham my case weight was 20 kg but their scales showed 21kg. Which was no surprise. Returning from Tenerife with case now weighing less on their scales it showed 25.5 kg. They were about to charge me but I told them their scales were wrong and said I would remove and put in my carry on bags which were way under 10kg. Knowing they were not going to get any money from me they let it through. I just wonder how much money they gained from this racket.
