I feel fat in a slimish body.I went to my doctor for help which was really embarrasing and he told me that there was no help available and sent me to see a nutritionist to tell me what foods i should eat. Well i dont know about you but i know what foods are good for me and i know what portions are good for me.The doctor told me there is nothing to do because of the way i do it for periods at a time.Is my case not impotant? what makes it important? because i know what iam doing to my body its not healthy!
