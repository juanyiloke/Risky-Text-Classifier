International business2012-04-06, 01:15 AMCan anyone enlighten me on the working ways of the French...the way they conduct business and protocol with women? How is a woman viewed when conducting business?I just started working for a French man about a month ago (I am in the States and he in FR). He was calling me consistently at first to talk about the biz, but now he doesn't call me at all. Just emails. Does this mean he trusts me that he is not calling? I can't call him because I don't have international calling. But he is always available by email.I would just like to know more about the way the French do business.Merci beaucoup
