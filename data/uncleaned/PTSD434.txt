ÊFinding out I have PTSDHello, don't think I've posted in here. I found out that I really have PTSD not from military never been in it but from child abuse and severe emotional abuse. This week, I am gonna be having the actual sessions with my new therapist. My new therapist told me 2 weeks ago about having full blown PTSD while ex-therapist said I have some symptoms never bothered to use any different therapy approaches.I have read a little bit of PTSD kinda makes sense why everything is so upside down. I still live in the toxic environment until I can have the amount of money and already be full time to do what I need to do mind you I am the only one making this happen as nobody else bothered to help long ago. I was doing grounding techniques stopped doing them because life happens and have no kind of solidity or quietness in this craphole! It makes it even harder to do the grounding techniques.We will see what's gonna happen gonna be interesting and scary once things to unravel....
