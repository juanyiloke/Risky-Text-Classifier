Why I Desire DeathSo let me begin with the basics, I am not in danger of self slaughter currently, but I do have my sights set on death by age 30 (4ish years from now). I'm a male, single, employed (for now).ÊI thought talking about my justification for suicide would be useful for me, in that, I can be exposed to new perspectives, write out my reasons and see them on paper, as well as be challenged, and challenge others. You see I want my death to be an informed decision, not a grave mistake. So with that said I don't know if this is the right forum to be talking about it, if it is not, than please direct be to a more appropriate one.ÊSo lets start off with my abilities:I have a terrible time focusing and staying on task, recalling information on the spot, expanding my thoughts, retaining incoming information, poor with reading and writing, slow at processing information, and difinately view the world in an odd manner, and probably a limited one due to cognitive disabilities.ÊI have so many problems that I am really not sure how I am going to get them all down and recall them....ÊSo let me attempt to recall my motives for wanting death opposed to life.ÊMy life is going to be tremendously difficult (painful, humiliating) to live (work, social)I am an incredibly envious personI want particular things out of life that I am coming to discover are simply out of my league for a person of my capabilities.ÊI am unwilling to adjust my basic goals or standards for a good lifeI refuse to live out my life as a pathetic individualI don't want my only existence to be a nightmare, a world gone wrong.I don't like myself for things I cannot change (mental speed etc)ÊLife doesn't have much to offer a person like me.ÊI believe suicide to be just in many circumstances, and in some cases honorable. (but still selfish)ÊI will expand on my points and problems upon request.
