How to quit your job in a small, tight knit industry2012-05-06, 06:19 AMI reached somewhat of what may be a breaking point this past week. Some shit hit the fan on a couple of projects and my attitude at work took a turn for the worse. This coupled with an ongoing project (which is late, meaning the owner has the right to sue us for liquidated damages over a million dollars) with which I have hit a brick wall and am receiving no support from anybody within the company and those were are working with outside the company.ÊNeedless to say, I think I'm going to start shopping for new jobs.ÊOne issue is that I work in a pretty tight knit industry (a couple of industries... Mecahnical Contracting and Wastewater Contracting). If I wasn't to specify otherwise, a good deal of my prospective employers would immediately call my boss to tell him that I had applied at their place.ÊThe other issue is that my company is a very small one, and I know that my leaving will impact the company negatively in more than one way.1. I currently account for ~20% of the revenue. They could make up for a lot of it without too much extra work, but there would be a few hundred thousand dollars that they would have to basically make up my hours for, and would probably lose quite a bit of it.2. They would all have to start working long hours to pick up the slack.3. I would feel bad because I know the owners so well (I dated their daughter, etc.).ÊI'm very torn. If I worked for some huge corporation where I was one of many doing my job, I'd be gone already, but it's hard to do when you have no backup and you know that you'll be hurting people by leaving.
