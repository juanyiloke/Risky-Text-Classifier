Also probably have adult ADHD. That caused my half hearted attempts to seek help to just fade away, and just "get on with it". I've been an expert on putting up a false smiling frontI am in an extremely dark place right now. I have had suicidal thoughts every day for many years. Twice in my life I have acted on them, but both attempts unfortunately failedAt the moment, I am fighting the darkness but sometimes it's extremely overwhelming. I have no friends, no family, debts, and a job where the workload is so ridiculous it is affecting my health (and that workload was also a major factor in the breakdown of my relationship)The darkness is validated by the fact that I know I would not be missed in this world. There is nothing for me, no place. I hate everything about myself. That actually doesn't bother me so much on an intellectual level, it just means that if I decide to implement my planned solution then I'll do it quite calmly and rationally. It wont be a "cry for help", just an end to the miseryHowever, I have 2 things I am concentrating on:1. I have finally truly admitted I have depression. I've always known, but I've been to see my GP who is seeing me weekly, and giving me weekly prescriptions of Citalopram and Chlomazepam. I've taken my first weeks worth, but obviously they wont really have any effect yet. I'm not going to let this slide, I will keep up seeing my GP, along with the Psychiatrist and probably the Psychologist. That might in the medium term change the way I feel about myself2. I am in debt, it was quite a large amount - 5 figures, but I've worked out that I'll finally finish paying that off by May 2015 and be completely debt-freeThere, I'll try to use this to keep track of how I'm doing
