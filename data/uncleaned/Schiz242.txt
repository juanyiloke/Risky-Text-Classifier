Something told me to turn left onto this busy truck route instead of right-to go home.It was a tiny ball of fur cowering in the gutter, soon to be flattened by the many big-rigs on this route, or a hawk or other predator looking for a snack.I slammed on my brakes and grabbed a towel to toss over this scared $hitless little ball of now claws and teeth.Wrapped it tight and took it home!After a few hours it calmed down, so I fed it and gave it milk from a bottle-don't everyone keep a tiny baby bottle in their kitchen?Within 24 hours this baby has become my best friend in the world-not so much for my other 5 cats, but this little one loves to snuggle and keep me close.
