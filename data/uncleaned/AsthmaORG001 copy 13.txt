Going round in circles A bit scared Hi there. I've been back and forth to go since December with repeated exacerbation so. On prednisilone every four or five weeks. Go said I need to see asthma nurse, but saying its best to wait till I've been of steroids for six weeks. Clearly that hasn't happened. Anyhow, long story short, finally saw nurse this week, and she told me I may have cold. I'm frightened half to death. Have to see GPs next week and probably have Spirometry test. In the mean time nurse has doubled seretide to four puff twice a day of 250. Feel as though this is taking forever to sort out. And just still on a treadmill. Have been able to reduce ventolin use a bit last few days, but still breathless if I do anything, waking at night tight chested and coughing. Any ideas anyone what I can do, if anythingThanks for listening.
