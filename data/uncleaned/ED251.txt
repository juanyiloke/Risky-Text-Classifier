ÊI'm scared I'm going backwards.I'm not sure if "trigger warnings" are the norm here, but I'm putting one anyway.ÊSo, just be aware...ÊSo, I'm new. I just made my introduction post...ÊI'm here because well, I'm terrified.ÊI've made so much "progress", but recently I'm starting to get "old thoughts" again...I guess they're not really old thoughts, they've always been there, but whereas since I was 18/19 (I'm 23 now), they've been like "whispers", now I can feel them screaming at me.ÊI've struggled with my weight due to various reasons since I was 13, so yeah.. 10 years. It hasn't been so bad the last couple of years, until now.ÊI skipped a meal today, I lied again by saying I'd eaten out.ÊI'd been home alone all day, torturing myself, I was sat looking in the mirror just picking faults.ÊThen I went for a bath, I put the same song on repeat, and I sat there for like 2 hours, just screaming/crying. I was hysterical. In that moment I just wanted to die, I hated myself.ÊI'm so scared.Ê
