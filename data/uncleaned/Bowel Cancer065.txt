Becoming who you really areI didn't know what to call this topic, but wanted to discuss if anyone else has bought about quite a transformation in their lives because of their diagnosis with cancer.I have found myself dancing more and more to my own tune now, not to other peoples expectations of me. For example, I always wanted platinum hair (kind of like P!nk), and the other day, I said to myself you are not on chemo for the next week or so, and you still have a full head of hair, and there is no time like the present and I just walked out the door and did it. Then I went out and bought make up and jewellery and clothes, and just updated the look quite dramatically. I am also looking at getting a half sleeve tattoo, which is something I have simply wanted for years and years, but once again, I have been conforming more to what I think society would want. I don't know when I can fit the tattoo in, I'll have to talk to the oncologist about where it might slot safely into my treatment plan.I am sure it doesn't happen to everyone, but I have been quite fascinated by the change it has bought in me. Here is my facebook profile if you want to see my new look, have a click on the profile picture. Everyone loves it! I didn't know if I could pull it off, but the resounding consensus from my friends is yes  www.facebook.com/julia.watson1If anyone wants to friend me on facebook, as an aside, feel free. Just be warned that I post a lot, I have a bawdy sense of humour, and I swear a lot. If this is not for you, definitely don't add me, lol.Who else has made big changes, either, physically, emotional, how you live etc...I would love to start a discussion about this!
