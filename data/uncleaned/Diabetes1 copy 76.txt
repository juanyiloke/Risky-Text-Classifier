Neuropathy problemsHey guys, I've been a type one diabetic now for 15 years and I can say it's been a long winded experience. I've gone from being the angel diabetic to not caring what I eat and if I took insulin. As a result, I have got really bad neuropathy problems. Needless to say now, I have the pump and have been in full control for 8 months, but the pain in my feet is ridiculously worse, even though my sugars are perfect. Was just wondering if anybody has any remedies that I could try? I've been given prescribed meds that don't work after a while, have tried creams and oils and it's the same result. It's gettin to the point now where I'm not sleeping at night and sleep during the day....
