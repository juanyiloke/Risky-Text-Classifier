What I like about being DiabeticSo I thought I'd go for a new angle  Firstly, I was diagnosed at 15 and finding out finally gave me the push I needed to move in with my dad, he was type 1 too and it gave me a whole new understanding of what life was like for him, meant I was better equipped to help him with hypos etc, and generally brought us closer together.Routine, I like routine so the regular blood testing somehow satisfies that part of my personality, when I test and get a result in target range I feel really happy and proud of myself.Free prescriptions, you have to admit it can be really handy!!HCP's, I've met some great ones in my time and I'm so grateful for all the work the NHS and it's staff do, we are so unbelievably lucky in this country. I would love to move to America but I couldn't afford it!! Regular monitoring with the doctors means that any other issues are picked up on in advance and other health issues are also dealt with in a more urgent manner because of the effect it can have on diabetes.Other diabetics, particularly when I did the DAFNE course, I met some great people.It encourages me to live a more active and healthy lifestyle, if I wasn't diabetic I might be a bit of a bum
