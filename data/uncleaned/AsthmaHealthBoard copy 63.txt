Smoking and Asthma________________________________________For almost a year now, I've been on and off smoking. It started with social smoking, and some months I wouldn't even touch the stuff, then in the past two weeks I've suddenly found myself on about 7+ cigarettes a day. I've suffered from asthma since I was 15, and when I started smoking it bizarrely disappeared. I had no symptoms of it what-so-ever, not even the most strenous 5 mile run with have me wheezing. But this past week I've found myself insanely short of breath and wheezing at night and in the morning. I feel like a complete idiot, surely this is because I've been smoking so much more. I've stopped now (second day in, I know that means nothing so early though), but could this be a result of smoking? Should I make an appointment with my doctor? Will my asthma go down again?
