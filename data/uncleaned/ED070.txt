RelationshipsSo...I've been bulimic/anorexic for the past 2-3 years and have had depression for the last 8, most of It all started with a very abusive relationship that I was in that is now 2 years over with and i've been doing okay...every now and then ill have a slip up. Any way's, since then I've put off relationships just because I feel that in order to be in a healthy relationship I myself need to be healthy. I've just met someone recently though. He's sweet, caring, knows about my problem, doesn't make me feel ashamed. He's there for me. But....of course theres a but...he just so happens to be overweight. I Know that sounds horrible of me I Know I really do considering I think I really love him. It's just hard for me because I never imagined the person i'd be with would be overweight especially since I'm well bulimic/anorexic and i've noticed myself judging him in my head aimlessly; not very often i might add but more than i'd like and ill have to stop myself and i just i don't know what to do...i hate that I'm judging him because i really Really REALLY do like him he is an amazing person and has done more for me than anyone has in a Long time... i just don't want to make him feel that way others made me feel about myself...and i don't want to separate...so... i don't know what to do...help?
