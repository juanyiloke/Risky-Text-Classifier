3 months post diagnosis - feeling smug!So in Feb I was carted off to hospital in an ambulance with a finger prick blood test of 32 - eek! 12 hrs later a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. 2 weeks after (2 days after starting low carbing) my hba1c was 8.9, so it probably had been higher but 2 weeks of no sugar probably brought it down a bit. In between, lots of nhs professionals including the hospital diabetic dietician saying not to low carb, but my daily readings have been within normal ranges and I have lost 2 stone.Today I return to diabetic clinic in hospital, hba1c done and it was 5.2   even found the doctor saying that low crab was the way to go for t2s but that it was hard to change opinions and it would take ages to turn advice around, but in the meantime to continue to do what I was doing and have annual hba1c test. He did say not to test, but I think I will test with new things rather than all the time now I am more confident in what I am doing. Sure the GP surgery will test me every 3 months. Got their hba1c test in 3 weeks! (Today was a finger prick instant test)Feeling very smug and pleased that I found you guys and your fab advice otherwise I would be eating lots of wholemeal bread and pasta and still have high bloods!
