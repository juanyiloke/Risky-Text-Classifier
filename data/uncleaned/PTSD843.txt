ÊIt was 3 years agoIt started 3 years ago, for a year October 2011 - October 2012 I should be over it, I'm in a new place, with new friends and the name is never mentioned, however I'm not, I still have nightmares (although the face is blurry in them, I can't remember what he looked like) I still sometimes have panic attacks during sex (although that could also be dysphoria from being trans) I still jump when I hear the name, or someone makes a rape joke or someone I don't like touches me.ÊI hate it, I hate all of it. I want it to stop, it needs to stop, I shouldn't have gone out with him, I shouldn't have had sex with him, I shouldn't have thought he'd loved me, I should have LEFT I'm so stupid, stupid dumbass who's stupid, I deserved it for being stupid and not walking away when I had the chance, I could have left at any time, but "he loved me" so I didn't, when it's clear now he obviously didn't love me, he never did, but it's my fault for being so unlovable, for winding him up and talking back at him, for not wanting to have sex. He raped me until I was bleeding then told me he loved me and I was so dumb I believed him.I'm disgusted with myself more than anything.
