pain after lumpectomy surgeries¥	Hi, just wondered if anyone can tell me how long before pain goes away. had lumpectomy over 2 weeks ago but had to have further surgery 5 days ago to remove large haematoma. Had wound check yesterday and nurse drew small amount of fluid from breast. Just seem to be aching all over including under arm and am just feeling so down and that it'll never get better. Nurse assured me that underarm wound has healed well and I have to go back in a fortnight to check recent surgery wound again. Think I'm just panicking in case it doesnt heal properly. Don't like to complain as I know other people are going through worse (I dont need chemo, just rads) but just wanted to know if anyone else could help. Thank you,  x
