So frustrated with modern technologyA Brief History, But a long story.I had an old HP Pavillion XP PC. on it I was able to burn Audio/Music CD's to suit my selective taste ie Classical instrumentals, these would play on any CD player or CD player equipped PC (I even burned the music onto CD for my wires funeral).That old PC has since died, so I upgraded to this new HP g6 Laptop, Windows 8 etc. . . .ÊNow I can not burn an Audio CD that will play on my old SANYO CD-X750 DSSS ( I guess around 15-20 years) they will however play on all modern players.ÊYes I suppose I should get a new HiFi system which will cure the problem.But my oldie was a gift from my late wife and I would prefer to keep using it, not only that although I have looked extensively I am unable to find a unit to suit my needs, ie an all in one unit with Record player, CD player, Cassette deck and Radio, but most importantly must have headphone socket with balance control as I have impaired and imbalanced hearing and I prefer to use wireless headphones so as not to disturb neighbours.Before any suggests it, I have tried different brands of CD-R, tried lowest burn speeds and ensure disc is finalised but Grrrrrrrrr no luck.Well that's my grouse.Has any one else experienced something similar?
