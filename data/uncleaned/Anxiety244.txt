Anxiety + GERDish symptoms + Sinus ArrythmiaHello all, hope everyone's enjoying there Friday. I suffered terrible panic attacks back in October, after a month of not being able to control them, i went on 10 mgs Lexapro for 7 weeks until I could work on myself through meditation, relaxation exercise and 2 week holiday break. I went off Lexapro and really had some crazy withdrawals for 3 months, mainly palpitations. Fast forward 1 month and i am now suffering with this indigestion that makes my palpitations go off all day and yes, bringing in a good amount of anxiety, I suffer from health anxiety, the cause of my panic attacks. I went to the doctors today and the EKG revealed that i had sinus arrythmia, basically irregular heartbeat dealing with breathing. Has anyone else dealt with this? and what do you do to stop these damn things. Meditation does help but during a class, I'm a teacher, I can't meditate or leave. any advice would be helpful. Thank you!
