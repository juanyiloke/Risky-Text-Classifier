Multiple symptoms relating to type 2 badly managedHi would be interesting to know if any of you fine folks suffer similarly to me especially if Like me you fell into bad habits for an extended period of time causing symptoms to surface. I have multiple sites of pain almost every body part at some stage in a week not severe but annoying background in most cases.Now that i intend long term to listen and learn and manage my condition sensibly how long should i be expected to wait to see improvement in symptoms. Will i also be able do you think to start to be able to reduce medication given for the type 2 currently 1000mg and 5mg trajenta daily . I would also be interested to hear peoples opinions on the other daily meds i take that could possibly cause some of the discomforts i suffer and wether it may be them rather than the type 2 meds causing the symptoms.cyanocobalamin 50mcg and Atorvastatin 10mg.
