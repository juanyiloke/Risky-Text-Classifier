Êintrusive thoughtsi have been having a lot of intrusive thoughts and i am wondering if they are typical. for example, i walk from my car to my apt door and the visual runs through my mind of somebody running up behind me and shoving me through my door and attacking me. this has happened repeatedly. this morning, i woke up and the first thought/visual i had was a man in riot gear running toward me in attack mode. and there is this overwhelming paranoia that i am going to get in trouble for something constantly lurking in my head. does this happen to anybody else? does anybody else have these thoughts? are they common or am i just a weirdo?
