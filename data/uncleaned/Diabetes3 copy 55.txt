Feeliing depresedIts been almost a year since i have split from my ex and boy its been a rollercoster ride so much that i ended up in counciling for a few months and now it stopped 6 weeks ago i feel that i have run out of energy and although i still have my son at home...which is a good thing i still feel lonely.I feel like a useless person a blob which cant do anything right wishing that my diabetes and my weight will go away if only i could turn back the clock i would figure out were i went wrong.My ex is not bothering with his son and can not see the problems he is having with his schoolwork, his health and trying to cope with things i want to scream at him my ex i mean and get him to lisen but he hangs up on me when i only want to talk about helping our son out.i wish i knew where the answer is?I know i dont post very often but i am a lurker just wanted to get it off my chestTopcat
