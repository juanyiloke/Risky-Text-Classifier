I'm a self-abuser and it turns me on or is punishingby frogs » Sat Jun 13, 2015 10:56 pmBPD anger/psychopathy- I'm a self-abuser and it turns me on or is punishing- I couldn't care if I seppoku'd myself at times, but i don't think it would work. Everytime someone attacks me or I am mad at myself, or looking for a way to get turned on, I turn it on and wow...let me just say surviellance is getting me in deep when they've seen me engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation. Couldn't care whether I live or die at times, but would rather just live. It makes me feel alive but it is really abusive.
