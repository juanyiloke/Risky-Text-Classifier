 verbal abuseWhilst my ptsd stems from an unspeakable attack on my person, I have become very interested in verbal abuse as was originally diagnosed with more than one personality disorder. I see this as verbal abuse in many ways as I was torn to shreds by a psychiatrist who appeared to be on a mission to destroy me with his words.I have been crying this evening as I watched 24hours in a&e and saw a gentle psychiatrist die from cancer. His mum said he treated his drug adficted clients as gentleman. This had me crying so very much because I was not treated like the gentle lady that I now know deep in my heart that I am.The book is Victory over verbal abuseByPatricia EvansIt is the last section which helped me greatly. Please go and get it from your library.As I cried I said out loud-I am a gentle lady. Sensitive. Good. Kind. Loving. Made perfect. Special. Important. Gifted. Talented. Friendly. Helpful. Special. He treated me like I was the worst person in the world.I was not treated like a gentle lady.I had been through a horrific attack. I was in bits and pieces. Frightened. Experiencing strange things that I could not verbalise at the time. Despite my telling him this. Despite my telling him that the police had taken me to a&e after the attack and all that entails, he made me feel like everything was my fault. He tore me to shreds. Spoke to me with words dripping with hate. He hated the person I was.If I'd had a personality disorder or two, should this be how one is treated? I almost lost my son because of this psychiatrist. And much more besided. I lost myself. I think I'm finding myself again. God will rectify this when this man dies. I hope. I know not all of you believe in God. I'm sorry to say this then but I believe everything will be rectified when he and my attacker die. Justice. Don't let anybody tell you that you aren't perfect. You have to be strong jn that.
