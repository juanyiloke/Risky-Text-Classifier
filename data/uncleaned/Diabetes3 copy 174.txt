More than the sandman in my eyes!Went to the diabetic clinic and discussed the reason I have to wear my reading glasses driving.Told nurse I was due to have my eyes tested it was 2 yrs since last prescription.She said don't! have an eye test.Because I was hyperglycemia some time ago, the 'Glucose' has got in my eyes and could take up to 6-8 weeks to normalise ??, now is not the time to get your eyes tested.Is this normal / possible ???
