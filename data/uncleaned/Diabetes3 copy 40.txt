Living alone with type 1. Any advice please?My eldest son has decided to move out of his shared flat and into one by himself. Thats OK but what of hypos? When my mum was ill I lived at her home so I could visit her in hospital every day, we live 200 miles away. I placed Coca-Cola in every room, on the floor, near the door. This did work on one occasion after I had walked from the hospital, for the third time that day, as I hypoed and dropped to the floor and drank a bottle which did the trick! However have any members any more suggestions we could implement? We do live 90 miles away from him. Thanks AM.
