35 yo with 3cm nodule - PCP doesn't want to follow upI went in for an abdominal CT last week (long story - felt mass in abdomen that showed up on ultrasound). The nurse called me on Thursday to tell me it was normal.This afternoon as I was leaving work, the doc called to tell me that a 3cm "nodule" had been found in my right lung. I was unprepared and literally walking to catch a train when she called. She said she isn't concerned because I'm 35 and a non-smoker (currently - I grew up in a smoking household and smoked socially in my early 20s). She said she hates ordering CT scans because of these random findings that just upset people. I asked again why she was not at all concerned and mentioned that my grandmother died suddenly of lung cancer at age 62 (had been a smoker for 20 years but had not smoked for 20 years prior to her death). Doc wasn't concerned. I mentioned I've been having trouble taking deep breaths for last 2 months and have been wheezy. Also not concerned.Naturally, I started google searching and found that nodules are classified as masses when they are greater than 3cm and 80% of those are malignant. Also saw that only 1/1000 cases of lung cancer occur in the 30s or some such. I'm guessing that it's probably nothing (based on the stats) but I have two small children and am the sole support of my family. I'm not interested in playing the odds and not following up on this issue. Something tells me that, if I were the doc's relative, I'd be getting a referral to a pulmonologist or a follow-up test.Am I overreacting?
