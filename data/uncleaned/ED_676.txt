Physical Recovery FrustrationMaybe triggering ... Talks about wanting to lose weight. I'm really fed up with the physical side of my recovery. I've lost enough weight over the years to be underweight, if you don't count the regains. Underweight is not a goal, just saying... It's really frustrating me at the moment. I feel like, dammit, eating well, where is my reward?! I know that's stupid. I lost last week and it felt great. So far this week I'm stalled and that is annoying. I just want to be a healthy weight, quick, already! I suppose, if I'm honest with myself, I still feel like I would do drastic things to get thin fast and "then" get the balance and acceptance thing right ... Of course, sometimes I feel like eating healthily is pretty drastic:p Argh. I'm not beating myself up. I'm trying to focus on what I like about myself as is, etc. I feel ok. Just impatient. Especially as I was so much closer to a healthy weight prior to my relapse. Sigh.
