Graduate degree opinion2013-05-06, 10:38 AMI'm 90% sure that I want to go to graduate school for Geographic Information Systems. My undergraduate degree is in Math, but unemployment is high in the state I live in and I'm finding hard to find a good job. I realize this is a track that probably won't ever make me rich, but it seems to pay well enough. I do know a couple of programming languages, so hopefully that will be a benefit.ÊDoes anyone work in that field, or know anyone that does? I'd like to get an idea of the work involved and the culture in the field.
