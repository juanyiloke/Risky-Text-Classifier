PTSD Flashbacksby BreeMacen25 » Sun Feb 15, 2015 5:54 amTwo nights ago while i was sleeping, during a grey dream, i was ripped from that sleep with the images of my mother in her bed at the MICU. I was there again reliving this ######6 nightmare over and over. I can smell the hospital, the flourescent lights making it even harder to see through the tears. Then suddenly i was running to the bed yelling,i trip and see her lying there…not moving,all the machines the wires the blood…i grab her and scream and cry but she won't wake up. I checked for a pulse,tried to see her breath. But she was already gone. I felt like my heart was being crushed and i couldn't make it go away. I began to have a panic attack and cry silently, i couldn't move. A huge part of me is dead.
