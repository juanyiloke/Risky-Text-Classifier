24 hours with no insulinA few weeks ago I felt that I was criticised unkindly in my Annual review for being too tightly controlled.After a bit of a rant here and some supportive feedback I've been having a go a paring away at my bolus to address the consultant's challenge of having fewer hypos regardless of whether or not those that I do have are completely self-managed.Having over a couple of weeks roughly halved my daily total use of Novorapid I've been very surprised to find no adverse BG spikes and less BG variation generally....spending more time below 6 without much effort.Over the last 24 hours I've taken this further and used no bolus at all and was comfortably below 7 within an hour of lunch and dinner yesterday and below 8 within an hour of breakfast today.I'm quite excited about this   but also quite perplexed   as it seems counter-intuitive that previous modest bolusing (typically 15-20) units of Novorapd daily) might have in some way been driving BG variation.Delayed honey-moon 14 months on from diagnosis and start of insulin therapy?
