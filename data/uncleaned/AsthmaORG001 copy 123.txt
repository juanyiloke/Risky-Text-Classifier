Moving out Off to University Hey all,I hope that everyone is well :)I'm honestly a bit confused with my lungs at the moment. Two weeks ago I moved out of my parents house to live in university halls and study Clinical Photography. Both of my parents are heavy smokers and It was pretty tricky to get away from the second hand smoke :/Since being at university I have managed to register with the local GP - I have made an appointment, but the closest she could fit me in without me missing any lectures was a week on Monday (its only really to sort out the repeat prescription). I have enough meds to keep me going in the mean time - I somewhat stock piled while my prescriptions were still free and I was in Sixth Form (full time education).I have noticed that I am slightly more breathless since being here. If anything there are less allergens here ,no dog; very little smoke, but those allergens didn't really previously affect me. I am actively trying to avoid my other triggers (anythings from the cold weather to exercise) but for obvious reasons this is not always possible. The symptoms I am getting aren't really preventing me from doing things in my everyday life. I can still walk round the shops and walk between campuses pretty easily. I suppose I was wondering if there was anything I could do in the mean time before I go and see the GP. I currently have it mostly under control and it is no where near bad enough to warrant A&E or an emergency appointment - though if my breathing does deteriorate I will make the decision to go to A&E. Everyone I am living with has been really supportive and we have stayed in instead of going to clubs and bars where I am definitely going to bump into some of my triggers.Many Thanks - Hope you are all well,Faren x
