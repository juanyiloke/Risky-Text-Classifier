l can't carry on...please help.Hi everyone...I have Body Dismorphia and can't cope anymore. It relates to eye bags and a condition called Syringoma which is small sweat glands under the eyes which multiply. I have a loving partner and a great stress free life, but non of this matters. I can't sleep or eat and I am just wondering how I am going to survive. I have no wish to carry on despite having everything. I feel so tired and I just want to die. I know it's shallow but I just see my problems with my eyes as overwhelming. I have cried so much and the lack of sleep is making things physically worse. I have good friends, but they can't cope with me. I am just about to go back on Citalopram, which keeps me awake and makes me not be able to eat.Please help me I am so desperate. I am 63 in 2 weeks and I don't think I can get that far.ÊSophie ? xx
