Down dayToday I've felt strange, i didn't want to get out of bed in fact i lay there and slept on and off until 1pm, because im not at work because I've stopped as my operation is Tuesday. Maybe I've found pain, managing Diabetes and worrying about pay as I've exhausted all my sick leave and will need to look at applying fr benefit fr the next 3 months as that s the length of time my surgeon said i will be needing off. Work helps routine and im full of anxiety inside but trying hard not to show my partner and my 12 year old son as that wouldn't be fair. Does anyone else feel overwhelmed? Even when good friends text to say fancy lunch, coffee i can't commit myself as i feel so detached sorry to whine!
