5th day on Elavil and getting big spacey feeling I just recently stopped the 15mg dose of remeron I had been on because I was noticing its effects dwindling the last few weeks. I was also recently taking tms treatments. I felt the two were really kinda working together, but I recently tapered off the tms around the time I was feeling down. I currently dont have a psychiatrist. My current is semiretired and the one he refered me to is not calling back. I got the elavil perscription from a walk in clinic. The remeron was really good, but it jusy felt like it was starting to wear off. I tried raising it past 15 mg but just got anxiety. I started taking the elavil at 5 mg for the first two nights and raised it to 10 the following 3 nights. I woke up feeling good this morning but as I fully woke I started feeling just odd and really spacey. Im thinking of scaling back to 5 mg of the elavil or just restarting remeron and getting back to tms. Just wanted to know if anyone had also had similar side effects/feelings on elavil?
