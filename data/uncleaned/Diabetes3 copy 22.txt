I've reduced my basal and this happened!I've been running quite low recently but on the whole with some frequent testing, reduced TBRs and Lucozade have on the whole have managed to minimise hypos - although it was a different story in the early hours of this morning. So today I reduced the basal at various times on the pump and I'm currently basal testing. I've found the results below brilliantly pleasing although I haven't been doing much in the way of moving around. In the last few weeks I've reduced my overall basal from 28 to 23 units and my 7 day average is 5.9.
