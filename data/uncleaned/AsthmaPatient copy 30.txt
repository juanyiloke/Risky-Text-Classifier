Does this sound like asthma?  6  Hi, so i'm 18 and i've never been diagnosed with asthma or any respiratory illness/dideas in the past. last night after a 10 mile cylce I started to wheeze when I exhaled deeply, now also when I inhale deeper than usual.This morning I woke with some chest tightening and also some tight feel in the neck./throat area. Possibly also having palputations but I've just got off of the nhs helpline and that made me nervous incase it turned out to be something serious.I know this will be irrelevant but i've always done strenous activities, weight lifting, olympic lifting, walking/hiking and long cycle routes..?If anyone can help me with this I would be grateful, I'm going to ring my gp when they open in half an hour, but they are very unreliabe and do not seem to care what is wrong. My appointment with them could not be until tomorrow or later on in the week so im just covering all bases!Thank you for reading!-Ellis
