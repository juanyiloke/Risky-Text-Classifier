Hello everyone, I am a fifty two year old male that was diagnosed with asthma at eight years old. I have live with asthma most of my life, went to urgent care more times than I can remember, used an inhaler 4 times or more a day, couldn't exercise and was in general poor health I change my lifestyle dramatically at age 48 and have now been off all prescription asthma medication for over a year. I was on inhaled steroids for over twenty years (always wondering what the long term side effects would be and thats another story) and went off those December of 2011. I breathe freely, exercise, run 2 miles two to three times a week and do not even carry a bronchodialator anymore( the old security blanket). I have never taken a breath of air for granted, even more so now and have been thinking about it lately and decided to share my experiences and lifestyle changes if anyone is interested
