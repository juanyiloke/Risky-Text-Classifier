Quitting smoking with asthma  5  Hi everyoneI've been a smoker for 6 years 2 months.  I'm 22 years old.  And I have asthma.I've smoked a pack-a-day for about 2 years. I want to quit.  But I've read online all these horror stories of asthmatic smokers nearly dying when quitting due to asthma attacks etc.I plan to speak with my Asthma Nurse or Pharmacist before quitting.  But what worries me is I've never had an asthma attack.  I'm not sure I'd even know what to do during one, except for take my reliever inhaler?Has anyone on this board been a smoker, and then quit? How did yours go?Cheers
