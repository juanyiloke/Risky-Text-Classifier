Does this sound like diabetes?So for the past few days I've been having shaking symptoms, not just of my hands but it feels like my entire body is sorta vibrating, it happens even if I have eaten or not. It does seem to go away for a bit if I eat something sugary. However it's not long before it comes back, I'm also experiencing weird feeling in my legs like cold feet. Never had a blood test for diabetes, I had a blood test at the end of last year but it was to check for any problem with my heart. Nothing was found then, would diabetes have shown? Even if they weren't looking for it? A weird thing was the other day, my hands and body were shaking. I was making a jam sandwich but I never got to eat it I had to go to my sister's house. I had stopped shaking by the time I got there and was alright? I don't get Dizzy or anything and I've never passed out yet (yl touch wood I dont) but I don't know what's going on or how to even begin to explain it to a doctor.. guidance?
