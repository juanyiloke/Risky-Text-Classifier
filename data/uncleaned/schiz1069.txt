What do schizophrenics do with their time?Hello,I am a 28-year old white male who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for 10 years. Although, I've likely been suffering from it for 15 years. I am an only child and both my parents are deceased. I have no aunts/uncles and all my grandparents are dead. I am on Social Security and live a reclusive life confined mainly to my apartment. Getting a job is out of the question at this stage in my life but I won't give up hope.My question to all of you is: What do you do with your time? I'm assuming many of you cannot work and may be living with loved ones but aside from family and a few friends, what do you do on an average day? Where do you go?Thanks in advance for any replies.
