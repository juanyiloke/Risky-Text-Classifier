 Hello, I got my memories 12 years ago that I was molested by family. I dealt with it, disclosed it to family, didn't see certain family members for over a year, and seemed to get through it ok. I had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I had 2 meds left, and 3 years ago, I came off of them myself. It wasn't easy, but I wanted to see if I could live without them. I gained a ton of weight, and slept constantly. In the summer of 2009, my then 19 year old son had a psychotic break, and got a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He has tried 3 times to attend college out of town, and almost a year ago, came home for the last time. He now lives at home, takes classes at an area junior college, and goes to church. That's about it. I have been a mess since he came home last year. I went back on meds (small doses) 2 years ago, I think. I am in counseling, but I am still absolutely miserable. The only relief I find (besides sleeping and eating excessively) is to watch videos on youtube about pimple popping and abcesses draining. Don't laugh. I can watch these right before bedtime, and not have a nightmare. There are other things in my life that are challenging right now, but this is by far the hardest. M.
