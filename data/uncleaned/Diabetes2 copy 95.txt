up's and Downs   Hi,firstly i should mention that i am newly diagnosed with type2 diabetes and probably would be able to keep most of you awake for a week with all the questions i have.i was tested by a pharmacist just because i had a massive thirst and a few other things which made me think was i or wasnt i a diabetic.my mmol/l reading was 29.1 it has since gone up to 30.4 and down as low as 17.9 are these fluctuation's normal?,i should mention also that i have been given METFORMIN x 1 tablet a day.please any info would be gratefully recievedSteve
