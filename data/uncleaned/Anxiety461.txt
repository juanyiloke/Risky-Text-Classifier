Nearing that "date of death"Some of you might've remembered how during my leukemia fears I randomnly thought up that I was going to die in 114 days. Well that day is exactly one week away. And while I t feel sick or anything the current events kinda make it seem like the perfect storm. I mightve just mwt the girl of my dreams, i'm finally moving out of this stupid town and everything's going well, kinda feels too good to be true. I just feel like something is going to kill me that day but I dont know what. I can't even be happy because I'm too scared that it mwans something bad will happen soon. Can anyone that has been through something similar give me advice? I'm starting to fall back into my derealization state.
