My 18 year old dd is having a baby at the end of July and will carry on living with me after the baby is born (dad not on the scene). Presently we live on a polluted main road in a fairly tough bit of London. We are considering moving a few miles down the road to get a better quality of life for us and the baby. We have found a lovely area by the canal and a large nature reserve. This bit of the canal has a lovely Marina housing barges and light barge industry. It also houses a very pleasant wine bar and a children's nursery. The marina is surrounded by a row of townhouses that we have fallen in love with. One is for sale and well within my budget. Am I mad to be even considering living this close to water with a young child. There is another house for sale only a couple of minutes walk away that is more expensive but still affordable but of course it is the marina house that has won our heart. What would you do?
