Counter a job offer money wise________________________________________Long story short - I've been offered a new job - which I applied for.Job offer is for 35K - entry level to this job is at least 40 - 45K , however 35K matches my current salary (OT and bonus excluded). In real terms it's a drop in pay of between 4-500 euro per month , a figure I can't absorb. I know I've nothing to lose etc etc , but I really am thinking that the gap between me and my prospective new employer is too great. I can't see them coming up by 10K , or giving benefits to match.Its been a while since I've had to go looking for a job , whats the feeling out there ? Is it very much take what you're offered and be glad of it ? Bear in mind I'm bringing over 10 years experience in this particular industry (not this role) to the table
