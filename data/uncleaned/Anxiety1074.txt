Inability to do certain sort of workHello everyone,Before I type my question I want to appologise if this is a wrong section of the forum for this, move it wherever it belongs as long as I get replies.The question is this. I have substantial difficulty doing work at my job. Whenever I am left to myself, and there is noone to oversee or cooperate with me on the work at hand, I will do most anything BUT the work. It feels as though all energy has been drained out of me when I face work given to me, no matter the time of day, mood or health I am in. My whole system protests against the thing, regardless of what sort of a job it is, physical or brainwork, difficult or trivial. It also happens if I have to work with a partner that has little enthusiasm for the work. I have no such problem when I have an inthusiastic partner or someone to watch over my progress even if this person is not very helpful. When I am on my own, however, I have all the energy and desire to do anything EXCEPT my task. This has been going on for years, and I guess it had begun sometime during school, although my memory of it is vague, could be earlier. I never did my homework at home. I am 24 now and it gets more serious by the day as I fail to produce results at work or do assignments given to me by my therapist and such.I can type loads about this thing of mine but I would rather you ask me questions if something is unclear or missing. I look forward to to your replies, and thank you in advance.
