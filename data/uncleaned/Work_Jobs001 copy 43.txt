Want to quit________________________________________I've been working with my current employer for the past 2 years now, and for the past few months I've been at my wits end with my job.When I began here I enjoyed working in the place because I'm interested in the work and I have certain freedoms I wouldn't find elsewhere. But over time the problems I've been having here have gotten bigger and bigger, with today being the last draw.My pay is awful. I earn almost 5 grand less than others who do the same job elsewhere for less hours. When I try bring up the issue of my wages, pointing out that there are people in call centres that earn more than I do by quite a lot (I'm work with marketing and business development) I'm made to feel guilty and told I can work elsewhere if I don't like it.My boss does not acknowledge any work I do. I recently worked out a deal with a new partner that was the largest direct sale in the history of the company, and not once did I hear "thank you", instead I was given out to because now my boss would need to generate an invoice for them. I regularly identify areas that we need to work on or develop, and I will be told to solve it, yet if I ask for anything, even a contact number for someone, I won't get it. I'll also get the head eaten off me for looking to spend money.I work 6 days a week, and my free time just doesn't exist. Yet I bring this up that I need more than 1 day off, I'm told the only reason I can't get 5 days a week is because he doesn't trust other people to handle things if something goes wrong, so having me here gives him comfort that things will be sorted.I hate coming into work now. I have applied for jobs yet nothing is coming up, and it's rare when I get an interview. Today was the tipping point as my boss came in for 10 minutes today, walked over to me and asked if I could do a quick job, left, came back in and told me "You smell rank" then left for the day. I'm mentally done and want to quit so badly. My only issue then is money. Money is tight and I can't imagine we'd be able to live (my wife and I) off a single salary. Plus I hate the idea of having to explain to potential employers why I have a gap in my CV.I'm at my wits end, is there light at the end of the tunnel? Should I just quit or do I stick it out?
