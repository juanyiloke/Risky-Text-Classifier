New memberHi,I happened on this forum today while looking for some answers to some post-op questions.About me, I am 55..discovered that I had lung cancer while getting at CT for kidney stones in November 2013. I had 60% of my right lung removed in January 2014 at the ClevelandClinic. I am struggling with rapid weight gain this past 3 months. I used to be a smoker, my last cigarette was in November 2013. When I went for my last check up in February I was back down to the weight I started at but since then I have gained 30 lbs! And I am swollen in my legs and ankles. they have ran all kinds of heart tests and blood work and all is well. I walk 2 miles every morning and it doesn't seem to matter. This is really getting me down. I keep reminding myself that I am lucky to be alive.Has anyone here experienced this?thanks, sisgldnhr
