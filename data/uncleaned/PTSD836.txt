ÊVivid Nightmares - PTSDHi everyoneIve been receiving treatment for anxiety and depression since May following a melt down at work and an attempt suicide back in September.I have been receiving CBT via the NHS since May and have now had 5 sessions of Focus based CBT having now been diagnosed with complex PTSD. I am booked in for 15 more CBT sessions and my therapist said yesterday that they will then offer me 20 sessions of EMDR.Anyway to get to the point...I have never been the type of person to remember dreams but recently the dreams have become more vivid. To the extent that I think I have started sleepwalking.I have woken up staring out of the window (which is something I use to do whilst experiencing my trauma), my husband has also found me sleeping on the stairs while I dont even remember getting out of bed.Last night I had a very vivid dream where I was back in one of the traumas. It felt so real, I woke up feeling sick and for that moment I actually think I believed that I was back there and not in a safe place.I have been taken Citalopram for 2 weeks now could this be a cause of the more vivid dreams or do you think this is just part of the recovery / processing stage of my therapy?Any thoughts or experiences would be great to hear, feeling confused and lost.Many thanks Nicki x
