Exercise & diet Hi all. I've been reading the recent posts regarding acid reflux. I find it quite interesting.Just before christmas i was fighting fit.I had the flu which left me with a chest infection. My asthma wasn't too bad. Previous to this i had just lost 3 stone on weight watchers. Over christmas i did gorge (as you do). Then just after christmas i was poorly again which resulted into me having my first asthma attack. I have put on 1 1/2 stone, which i can really feel. If i over eating i feel as though my lungs can't fill up as much as they should. Its an awful feeling. I am now back on track and have lost 4lbs. I exercising alot with my dogs & eaing really healthy. I have just started Tae Kwon Do, which the warm up is a killer. My lungs were on fire last week, but they felt as big as a hot air balloon.I am finding if i eat anything fatty or just too much, them i can't breath as well. Also my exercise is helping my lung capacity increase.Does anybody else believe (if you are able) that a healthy diet & exercise can help prevent asthma symptoms?
