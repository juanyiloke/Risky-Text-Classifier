Talk about something you love!  13    The following has been copy/pasted from the Mental Health forum:Hello everyone, I'm Courtney, I've been suffering with social anxiety disorder since I was 11 years old. (I will be 18 this July)I believe that an important part of acceptance and recovery from any mentall illness is to find and talk about things you love, and people you love, so I've started this discussion to try and boost everyone's mood today!The point of this is to mention something you do to relax, stay calm, and enjoy your life while dealing with side-effects of your mental health problems.For example, I enjoy playing video games because they can take me to a different world, and they let me experience places that are impossible in real life - whether it's a floating city 20,000 feet in the sky, a world where I am a heroic wolf ridding the world of evil with my paintbrush, or exploring the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Gaming is something that makes me feel like everything isn't so bad after all!  [lol]I honestly hope some of the people that see this will respond, we all deserve to have things that make us happy when nothing else can, and it's so important to acknowledge them.With much love, Courtney. xop.s. Games referenced here are Bioshock Infinite, Okami, and Journey. They are HIGHLY recommended by me  [smile]p.p.s. I hope these types of posts are welcome on the forum!
