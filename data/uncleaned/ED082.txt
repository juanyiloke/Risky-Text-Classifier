Back to my old ways... But worseHey everyone. I wanted to start by saying I had been purge free for about two weeks... As I type this it's been five minutes since my last purge relapse. Last time I relapsed you all helped me through it and told me it's normal. I am very upset but also, my restricting has gotten really bad again. Worse even because I now walk to work. Friends aren't really noticing my behaviors, and I didn't realize how bad it was until today. Then looked back. I have gotten so bad and I didntt realize it. I want to recover so badly. At the same time, I am really still afraid of weight gain. How did I not realize I was restricting so much?Idk what to do, I'm afraid to go into treatment since I have work and I can't miss. My therapist doesn't usually work in this area.
