7 mm noncalcified left lower lobe pulmonary noduleHello everyone. I am very glad I found this site, need all the help and support I can get. I am beginning to get nervous, back in May 10,2013 I had a PET Scan for abdominal pains and they accidental found a 7 mm spot on my left lower lobe nodule. Had to follow-up 6 months later, which was done Dec. 23,2013.This waiting is making me afraid. Could someone please tell me what to expect? Be Bless everyone:
