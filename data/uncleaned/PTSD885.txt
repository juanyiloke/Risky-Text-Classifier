ÊC*t like a K**feA neighbour mentioned something to me today that was the most horrible trigger and immediately I had a pain in my stomach that felt like a c*t from a k**fe, resulted in the most awful stomach upset and I asked them to not mention it to me again, not nastily but they'll probably forget and tell me more in future. I can't bare to listen or know about any of it and thought they'd know better or realise but people really don't no matter what you've mentioned or they know has hurt you.ÊI feel so sad this evening now and am trying to distract myself here but can't stop flashbacks or crying. Sorry I don't know why am posting this and don't want to upset anyone but just needed to 'get it out' xx
