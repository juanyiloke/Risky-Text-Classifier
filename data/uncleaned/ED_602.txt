Just realized I have bulimiaHi there,I've been purging on and off for a little over a year now. I just realized it's been that long... I only did it when I was completely alone, which was like a couple times a week, sometimes none at all, sometimes a bit more.ÊI didn't think I was doing damage to myself, I feel so stupid, yesterday I purged and I spit a little bit of bright red blood. Just a little bit. I had crackers with cheese, it took a bit of effort to get it out, some coughing, maybe I forced it too much and scraped my throat? It was just a little bit. That was yesterday, today I have a stomach ache, a sore throat and nausea, some reflux too. I had never felt bad after purging, the bad feeling used to go away a little while after. I had a healthy dinner after that, I felt so guilty for purging.ÊI feel so sad and stupid for harming myself. I have promised myself to NEVER purge again. EVER. I just won't. It's over.But did I maybe do some damage to my body?I'm so worried.I'm so stupid...Thanks.
