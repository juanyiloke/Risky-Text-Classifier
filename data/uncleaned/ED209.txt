ÊHi All... it's been a while... And I'm back not doing too goodHi all,How are you all?Sorry this might be a little bit of a long one...So here's the thing. I had to keep a diary for my ex counselling a while back, and at that time I thought I had lost it or something because it disappeared. I know now that I was wrong, and actually it was stolen by a coworker who has kindly shared it with the staff ten who I manage. This has made me feel pretty vulnerable and although my manager has been brilliant, I am really struggling with the thought of going to work each day not knowing who knows what about me. I feel sick to my stomachs all day everyday and I don't want to eat. I need some help please?Then... On top of that... My boyfriend has been going out for drinks with another girl and discussing things about me and my relationship which she is then rubbing in my face. I think she is wrong... And he is wrong to do it but when I try and talk he becomes defensive and shuts me off. I don't know what to do as he was one of the only people I trust. Now he is asleep next to me and I'm in bed with him but cant sleep.ÊI haven't slept or eat properly in days and I am really scared this is making me spiral again... Please help?Thank you!
