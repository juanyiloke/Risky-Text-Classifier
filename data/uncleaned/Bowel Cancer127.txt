OverwhelmedI'm struggling right now (range of unrelated reasons) but the one thing I do have control over is making a decision about scans. It basically comes down to this..I have right abdo pain that is there on palpation, sometimes hurts on its own, and is tender when exercising etc. The colorectal team have referred me for another CT scan (I had one in April when the pain was already there, and it was clear). I have a GP referral for an MRI, but that costs $450. Drs are saying cancer doesn't hurt and it's probably adhesions from my Caesarians, which, according to google, doesn't sound like an unreasonable explanation. I don't have money to splash around, and having the MRI would mean cancelling the CT at the hospital and turning back up for my follow up appt and confessing I ignored their advice and had the MRI, and providing the report to them. It feels awkward, expensive, and to be honest I'm just exhausted. Right now I'm leaning towards just going with the hospital's follow up schedule (CT in oct, follow up in Dec, genetic testing early next year and another colonoscopy next year)... but a little part of me keeps wondering how I'd feel if down the track it turns out there's something there - all the drs can do then is go "whoops", but I'd be living with it.I guess I just wonder what others would do. ???
