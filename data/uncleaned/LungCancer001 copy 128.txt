  Question about results (not a happy camper!)Ok. I posted that I had a PET/CT scan yesterday. Well, today I called my doctors office to leave 2 phones numbers that I know that I can be reached at and the receptionist said I had to make an appointment to get the results. Ok, cool. I get that, but I asked her if there WERE to be an issue, someone would call me, right? She rudely replies, "Ms. Lang, you have to come in for your results" like I was bothering her or something! So, let me ask you all, If my test came back positive that I do have cancer, someone would call me first, right? Oh and please believe me, I will be letting the doctor know that I had this incident with one of her staff. By the way, I have to wait until May 28th to find out the results!
