This morning with the GPWell, that was interesting. I'd booked an appointment with my GP as I thought my medication review was overdue. However, she looked at my records and said anxiously 'oh, your blood test is overdue!' Oops... I'd got a letter from them last time, and to be honest didn't think it was due yet, but the last one actually was in May!! (Time flies when you're having fun...) So I've got an appointment for it for tomorrow  . And I've written in my diary when the next one is due...The GP was very pleased with my progress, my blood pressure, and my chat about exercise. In fact she said 'I wish all my patients were like you!'  I also found out that the previous diabetic nurse was back again (after a long maternity leave) so I was well pleased, as she had been very supportive and encouraging. I feel quite chuffed!
