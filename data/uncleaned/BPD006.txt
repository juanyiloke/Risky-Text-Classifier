Help! Maybe Borderline Personality Disorder. Opinions pleaseby Angel Grenné » Sat Jun 13, 2015 7:04 pmOk I'm new to this forum. Recently (Past year and a half) I've been craving attention like my whole self esteem depends on how people perceive me. I have been doing anything for attention, I even got my ears pierced just so people can look at me. I am a straight male and I have been doing everything to get women to view me as attractive even at inappropriate times like my bosses and superiors. If I see a guy who I think is better looking than me I immediately think of ways to physically harm them (I have no actual intentions) it's just some sort of defense mechanism. If I feel criticized in any way I want to cut myself or burn myself with a lighter. I just want everyone to view me as sexually attractive and like I fit in with this world. I have been feeling the symptoms of what I believe to be derealization; I just start to turn off attention and focus and my eye sight seems to turn grey as if I am in a glass dome covering my whole body. If I find out that people have not been thinking about me in anyway or talking about me in a conversation I feel betrayed and hated. I have been feeling the urge just to take off my clothes and run around in the nude for people to see me and find me attractive. Well I don't want to keep going with this so please tell me what you think.
