 Don't really feel hunger anymoreDoes anyone else get that? And is it a relatively normal thing or something to worry about?I don't seem to feel hungry ever, the only way that I can tell that I need food is by my stomach rumbling. I'm not sure how long this has been going on for, but it's been at least a few months. I rarely eat breakfast anymore, and sometimes skip lunch, but generally when I do eat it it's just a piece of garlic bread or a cookie. Dinner on the other hand I tend to eat a decent amount of, though is at least partly to do with the fact that me not eating very much would irritate my mother quite a lot. Yesterday was different however, by the time it got to dinner I had eaten nothing but a mcflurry all day, and I had to go and buy dinner (chips) because the rest of my family were ill, but all the way up there I was debating whether or not to get myself anything. In the end I did because I thought that I would somehow end up telling my friends, who wouldn't be very pleased with me, but I had to force myself to eat anything at all, which is a complete new low for me.So yeah... what's up with me? (If you happen to want anymore info. feel free to ask and I'll reply as soon as I see it  )
