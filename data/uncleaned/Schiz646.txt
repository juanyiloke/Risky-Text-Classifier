Êgoing off medsHi, I've been on meds for last 2 years, I tried Olanzapine, Sizodone LS, and now I am on abilify ... even though I am not getting psychotic episodes, I always feel anxious, restless and depressed.... I tried taking SSRI but it made me even more anxious. Right now, I think my main problems are caused by meds and their side effects... so I decided to go off meds and see what happens...is it a good idea...I am sick and tired of taking meds and dealing with all the side effects, especially restlessness and anxiety. So, how should go off the meds and is it a good idea.
