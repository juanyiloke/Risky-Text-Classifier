This weekend, Saturday, there was a fire in our small college town. The fire fighters are voluntary, but there are alot of younger guys on the depatrment. My boyfriend happens to be an EMT and a fir fighter. THe call came in around 5:30 a.m., I got the pleasure of hearing the tones from 4 different pagers in the small house he lives in. The call was for a house fire and EMS and firefighters were needed. He sleepily got up and went to the call. The fire was so bad, there were two college students, no older than 21, stuck in the top floor of the burning house. The fire raged, and it was unsafe for anyone to continue the resuce... both student died in the fire. He wasnt shook up about it at first, but recently it began to hit him. He just shut down. hasnt really talked to me about it.. luckily he talked to the fire chief about it last night. This morning i had a meeting at 7 am, my alarm went off (its a loud warning alarm sound) and he started talking in his sleep. Its normal for him to sleep talk and half the time he just gibbers, but he started off by just saying "No....No....No....NO" I left him be and got ready then he started actually talking in his dream, "Have them jump or get the ladder," "Then move the ladder," "Well put a sheet over the bodies." The last comment was the one that scared me. I had to wake him up. I caressed him and woke him up calmly... He woke up dazed and a bit confused asking why i woke him. I told him he was dreaming and talking but doenst know what he was dreaming about. My dad suffers from PTSD from the Persian Gulf War, and well i have never had to deal with this, so it scared me. It really bothers him, and im worried... I dont exactly know what to do. Im not sure this is PTSD but the dream and vivid talking really has me worried. is there anything else it could be or is it PTSD... this is really fresh, it happend on the 30th
