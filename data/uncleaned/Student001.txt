 Anyone here changed courses after first year - need advice plsby LeaXHi  I am just about to finish my first year at uni and I have an unconditional offer for a course change back into 1st year at the same university. I haven't sat my exams yet but they're coming up and I was wondering if these results mean anything in terms of my CV? Obviously I'll have to put that I was at university for 4 years but does it matter whether I fail the exams? I am finding it hard to motivate myself to revise for them.
