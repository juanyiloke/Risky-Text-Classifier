Êson and iWe both suffer from pdsd .We both had unloving mothers who were both very violent.Why I am writing this is because my boy had a bad attack last night and hase'nt come home after drinking alcohol and taking 2, 5ml diazepam.I am worried sick ,don't know who to turn to .He gets so confused and angry.I hope he is ok.He had a row with his girl friend who is trying to cope with his moods and he is pushing her away and I cant blame her as he get very frightening when he goes on one.Should I phone the police or wait and hope he just walks through the door.GOD PLEASE KEEP HIM SAFE .
