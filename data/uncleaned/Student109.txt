Transgender Stuff with Uni doctorby Hoosha=[ Ok I'm a first year student and I think I'm transgender and I want to take the step to change my life for the better except I'm now with the on campus GP. I have social anxiety and I'm a very nervous, shy person so idk how the heck I'm supposed to breach the subject of gender dysphoria with a doctor I only met like once. Do you think I'd be the only student asking things like that? Is it silly of me to want to ask the uni's on-campus GP and will he even be able to help me T.T? And is it a bad idea to start going through this in the middle of university?
