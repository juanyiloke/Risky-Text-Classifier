Attacks on poor pensionersI want to get it out of my system. I am in a ferment at what is happening to poor pensioners like me thanks to the goody goody clowns who run this country:(1) Minimum price for a unit of alcohol. One of the few pleasures left is a bottle of sherry and a few cans of lager during the week. Due to the behavior of a load of young morons with more money than sense, my pittance os a state pension will be eroded drastically.(2) Why should old buffers like me be forced to wear cycle helmets - for God's sake why?(3) Plastic bags. I use my bags for storage and for bin liners. I'm not going to pay inflated prices for plastic bags as per Lidl. My dustbin as a result is going to stink.(4) Aldi and Lidl do not offer cheap prices - they used to but not any more!(5) Why can't pension increases be linked to PPI ( no not the bankers' crooked scheme but PENSIONERS' PRICE INDEXÊ what we have to pay for vital goods to survive.That'll do for now but there's more - much more to come!
