Road to recovery... how do I say sorry?Hi all, I am new to this.I have been suffering for a number of years and have lacked any confidence etc for most of my life. Over the past year I have lied about some things which were quite serious but it was the only way I thought I could have some attention as no one would want to be my friend if they didn't have a reason to.I hurt a lot of people, in particular 4 very close friends. 2 have given me a second chance, the other 2 have not spoken to me since this all came out in January. I have been undergoing some CBT sessions and I think it is working, I've got some new focuses in my life and trying to get things back on track. I have not spoken to my best friend since this all came out in Jan and I really miss her. I don't know what I should do? I understand she may never speak to me again but I don't know if I can try? Should I write her a letter? Any advice would be much appreciated.Emma
