So so interview2012-08-05, 01:05 PMI interviewed for a great job with a great salary.First with the corp recruiter over the phone, then she brought me in to meet with the HR director and a senior sales manager.Those interviews went well and I was brought in two days later to meet with the area VP. Nice guy but he wouldn't stop talking to ask me a single question. I had to jump in to speak about how my qualifications/experience was relevant to something he mentioned.The interview was pleasant enough and I followed up with a thank you email reitierating my interest in the job.ÊHaven't heard from them, what would be appropriate next steps?
