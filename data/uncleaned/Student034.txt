 Aberdeen or Strathclyde?by TomCooperHey everyone, I'm new here. So I have gotten conditional offers from all of my choices. I was looking to studying in Glasgow university, but their conditions are too high for me, so I've chosen University of Strathclyde as my firm choice and Aberdeen as a back-up. Now I'm not so sure if I made a right choice. I really like both universities, maybe Glasgow city is a little more attractive to me. Aberdeen's course is for biochemistry and Strathclyde's is for biochemistry and pharmacology. I thought that I've made the right decision until I saw that in most places Aberdeen is recognized as a better university than Strathclyde. It would be really helpful and beneficial if someone could advise me about this. Especially, the students from both universities. What do you think about these universities? Courses? Cities, people? Thank you in advance.
