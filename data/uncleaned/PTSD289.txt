feeling obligated?by __nonreality » Mon Feb 03, 2014 6:40 amMy grandmothers 90th birthday is this coming up weekend. My mother told me I should go with my father to go visit... I DO NOT want to be anywhere near my father or his family. I'm living with both parents (there is NO logical reason why these people are still married but i digress...) If I don't go I will be treated like $#%^ for a month and questioned and demeaned etc etc. Should I feel like I NEED to go? My father is abusive and needs serious psychiatric help and I do not feel comfortable with that side of my family to begin with BECAUSE of him AND my grandmother, who was also a really mean bitch. I am honestly terrified of it and I have images in my head of leaving home just to avoid all of this and especially avoid them treating me like $#%^ for making my own decisions... I'm just sick of feeling like $#%^ because of these people! Someone say something to convince me I don't have to go. that I don't need to feel like I owe them...
