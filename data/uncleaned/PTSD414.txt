ÊBreaking cycles of depression caused by PTSD

I know many of you also suffer from depression due to PTSD. I am one of them. It seems the more anxiety I have, the worse it gets. I've recently moved and all the stress of that, my husband failing health, getting my kids into college, and finding a new therapist has really done a number on me. And that is just my current life situation, doesn't even include the work of desensitizing the trauma that I need to do with a T to help with my PTSD. It seems like the more I have to do, it is just so overwheming to me, that I don't do anything. Does anyone feel this way or experience it?Ê
It is a cycle. I've been in therapy for a long time, that I KNOW what I need to do to get out of this, but I just don't have the motivation. I know just doing baby steps and getting something done is better than looking at the the big picture and actually "freezing" up from doing anything. Because then I have the guilt of not doing anything.

Well the last few days I am trying to overcome this. I made a ton of appointments with new doctors, dentists, OBGYN, car repairs, etc. that I have been putting off for over a year or more. I have also been spending a ton of time on the backyard. I have even built and designed a waterfall with a pond. It gives me a nice quiet and peaceful place to be too.Ê

But for the first time in months I actually feel GOOD. Now I want to get the rest of the house organized and unpacked. I am hoping these few good days is enough to break the frozen cycle of mine.Ê

I see my new T for my 2nd visit today. I am nervous but hopeful she will be okay. My old T sent her a letter on the work we did over the last few years and what I need to work on. It's in 2 hours, and my stomach is doing flip flops. lol
