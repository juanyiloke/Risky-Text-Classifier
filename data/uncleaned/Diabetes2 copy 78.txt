Metformin - What are the side effects? Any changes in mood noticed please?   I was diagnosed type 2 Diabetes in May this year and given Metformin straight away 2x 500mg a day as my fasting Glucose level was 22!!Shortly afterwards I started having symptoms of what I now know to be Anxiety and Panic disorder and by July I had stopped taking Metformin, and after a disasterous few days of taking Fluxoteen (Prozac) which made me feel suicidal I was given Diazepam just to get some rest.To cut a long story short I cut down the Diazepam little by little and now take nothing and have just started back at work on a phased return. Now that I am facing things again I realise that |I must take control of the Diabetes and need to start taking Metformin again and looking at my diet as I had a couple of months when I hardly ate and I am now eating far too much fat/sugar/carbs.My problem is that because my anxiety problems started around the same time I started the Metformin I cannot bring myself to take them again as the fear of being in the grip of anxiety and panic scares me so much. I know that the Metformin are unlikely to have contributed to me being mentally ill I would just like to hear from people with experience of Metformin and any side affects they had and how long it took to get used to them. Thanks
