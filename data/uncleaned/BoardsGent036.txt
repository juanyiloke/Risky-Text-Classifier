Let's talk about pornI am sure a few of you will have seen the Tedx talk where Gary Wilson describes porn as something that evolution has not prepared our brains for.ÊLink for anyone who hasn't seen it:Êhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiUSo i'm curious as to the thoughts of people on this. I think it's an important discussion. He pretty much says that porn can cause erectile dysfunction, social anxiety and feelings of worthlessness. Do you agree/disagree? Some of you may say moderation is key. But what is moderation? Once a day/week/month?Personally I've come to realize how addictive it can be over the last 2 years. Gary Wilson says in the video that as an experiment guys should try stop watching for 90 days. I've only ever managed 60. It's embarrassing to admit but I think it's good to be open about it. I've said it to my mates and they all say "I dunno how you can even go a week without it". Is porn a bad thing?
