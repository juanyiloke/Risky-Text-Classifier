What's Your 6 Month Goal?Hello everyone, I don't know how this will go but let's do it. Post a goal that pushes your boundaries and gets you out doing something you haven't done before and you have 6 months to complete it and post back in this thread. It could be a new hobby or just a new experience, maybe you just want to do something you haven't done in a while but has been on your mind.  My goal - I've always wanted to catch the train and go for a big bike ride through the city. Some suggestions: Cook a new dish you have never made before, buy a huge jigsaw puzzle and put it together, try a new sport (maybe join a club?), write a short story, go to a local event/fair/market, visit a museum, buy tickets to see a concert, organise a night out with a couple of friends, have a movie night and hire out a few movies you wouldn't normally watch, do some crafting/drawing/art type thing, if you like photography take a photo of one different kind of object/plant/sunset/whatever every day and post your best pictures online, go to a garage sale and buy something neat, start a gem/rock collection, make some jewellery, etc. If you post in here and don't achieve your goal in 6 months you will need to transfer $250,000 into my bank account so that is the incentive. Oh and also you might feel better too. If you have no friends like me you can still fly solo and achieve your goal anyway. Let's have em'!
