What I've learnt of loveHey everyoneI've missed you. I often lurk but I rarely write. But now I wanted to share with you something about love.I've learnt that in order for me to love more, I have to make the love naked. I have to peel off the bad layers. What if I love without asking anything back? A non-conditional love?I've learnt that since doing that I love much more. I see a divine face in strangers. Even if I don't profess a love for them, I can -- by loving those I love without demands -- see the beauty in strangers, acquaintances, friends and family. It's wonderful.Of course, I am not without pain. I am not without these horrible feelings of ending my life. But I can love without demanding anything from those I love. I hope for reciprocation. In fact, I dream of it, I want it. But I don't demand it. I can still love.A few thoughts in the evening
