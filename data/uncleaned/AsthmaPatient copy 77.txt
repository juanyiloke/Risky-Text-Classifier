I feel dreadful, my left side of my chest feels so tight and the inhaler seems to not do much but make me shaky (which I wasnt told about so I didnt use it much in the first week, this is my second week of using it).I am dreading this being a life long illness as I have always been a get up and go person, but I recently have been putting on weight due to lack of excercise...because I have been running out of breath too quickly. I am so sure the doctor wants to make comments, but is too polite (or am I becoming too self concious?) I had (self diagnosed) flu some weeks ago and subsequently, a chest infection. I wish I went to the doctor. I lived on Lemsip for 2 weeks because I didnt believe in wasting a doctors time. I have 4 very young children and I feel so devasted, and I agree with the last note...non-sufferers dont really take much notice! I have a niece with chronic asthma and I really didnt sympathise as much as I should. I can't vacuum the living room without becoming so tired.The doctor 'hopes' that she can cure this ... reading this website, I'm not so confident. I feel so depressed, my husband isnt being supportive at all, but only because he probably thinks I am making it up (he's otherwise very nice)Please could people write their stories, I want to learn a lot more.Thank you.:ill:
