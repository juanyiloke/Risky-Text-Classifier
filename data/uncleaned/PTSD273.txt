I think I may have PTSDby etoilebrillante » Thu Apr 17, 2014 1:36 pmFor the past couple of years, since I cut all contact with my family after years of abuse(mental, physical, sexual and emotional), I started to have anxiety attacks. Most of the time it's triggered by a memory of a beating or something that happened in my childhood/teenage years. I always crumble to the floor and can't stop crying. The flashbacks or memories are always really sudden, but sometimes it's in reaction to something I see on t.v or even sometimes a child crying. I know it sounds strange, but I'm worried and afraid to go to psychologist...I feel ashamed talking about the things that happened to me...can PTSD be caused by child abuse? It went on from the time I was 2 years old to 22 years old. I'm 24 now.
