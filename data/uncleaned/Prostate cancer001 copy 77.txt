Radiotherapy or Removal I'm a newly diagnosed 52 year old with T1 prostate cancer , 3+3 Gleason reading.Like a lot of you guys out there, I'm trying to decide on treatment options.Would like to hear from any guys out there in early fifties who had similar diagnosis and have either had radiotherapy to removal of prostate. Interesting in understandng side effects please too from someone who has been through either treatment.
