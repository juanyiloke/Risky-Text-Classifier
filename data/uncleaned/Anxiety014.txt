My anxiety seems to have ended my marriageI am married to a man who loves me so much, as do I love him, the problem is we can't seem to live with each other. ÊI come from a privileged background where the stress of every day life was never really an issue, he came from an non privileged background having to fight even for normal things. However the stress of money and general things cause my anxiety as I am not used to it, I am not saying this is right any way shape or form. When we got together he was always honest with who he was, maybe I was not, as I wanted a fairytale. I thought he loves me and at that point it was enough for me. However through our 10 years including marriage, both him and me can't accept my anxiety. He can't deal with seeing his wife cry every day as I am never happy, always something to worry about. I should have changed but I never seem to be able or put something else in the way, no excuse I know. But finally I have driven him away and I don't know how to live life anymore. What is the point without him, I am nearly 40, and we love each other. I really can't get my head around this around, I don't seem to have the energy to resolve it. My husband has been trying to help with my anxiety, he is a depression sufferer (which I have not been able to help him with for years now) but I can't even help myself but also can't bear the thought of losing him. Not sure what to do?
