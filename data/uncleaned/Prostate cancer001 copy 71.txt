robotics or not I was diagnosed , early onset & localised  following my brother's diagnosis , he has had surgery, robotics not available unless private health ins, in the Rep of Ireland, & is recovering well,I was happily steering a course towards "ordinary surgery" here in Northern Ireland because no 1 robotics haven't got here yet & no 2 I was advised that "funding would probably be an issue" if I decided to go across the pond for treatment .Met my surgeon yesterday to discuss operation & he threw a curve ball by suggesting no 1 robotics would probably have a better outcome for me & no 2 funding shouldn't be an issue .The timescale would be approx. 6 wks behind his surgery has anyone out there experienced having to travel long distances for surgery , have found the Devon lad conversation helpful
