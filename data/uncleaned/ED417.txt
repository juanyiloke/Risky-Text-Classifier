ÊI'm an emotional un-eater....For most of my life I've been unable to eat due to stress and depression and not feeling like I'm in the right time, species, or gender. I was under-weight for the greater period of my life. So I got better a couple years ago and was finally at a healthy weight, but I kinda felt like I was fat. Now lately I've been really stressed out because of relationship issues and just life and the same thing of not feeling like I'm in the right time, species, or gender. And I'm loosing weight rapidly. I can't muster up the motivation or want to cook or even put anything in my mouth.... My pants are now too big and I'm afraid I'll get down to even smaller..... I find I just want to drink some raw milk and lay under a bunch of blankets... But alas I am all out of milk...
