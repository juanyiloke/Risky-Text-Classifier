 hi, my name is Ebony. I am dx with PTSD. I have had it since I found my mother dead in the bedroom Jan. 2002  . I have been dealing with all sorts of emotions about it over the years. I am also dx with bipolar. I receive treatment for both and take meds. I am just on here looking for support and to make some friends who also are dealing with the same problems. If anyone has any ideas on how to deal with PTSD please reply.   Thanks ebony
