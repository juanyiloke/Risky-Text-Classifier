Êbad dayI wasn't feeling well today, anxiety was high but I went to an event anyway....The event was "the baby loss memorial", a day for me to remember my little one who I didn't get to give birth to. It was really hard and I was crying a lot.I am feeling guilty about it though, in some ways I am glad my baby died as dealing with my 9 year old (with ADHD ASD Anxiety...) is draining me and i am unsure how I would deal with another kid
