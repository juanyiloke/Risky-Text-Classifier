Things you're not always told aboutHello people. Don't get me wrong! I understand that because we are all unique, we will have very different reactions to treatment, but I wonder if any of you, like me, are facing issues you weren't told about following completion of chemo cycles? The peripheral neuropathy is obviously well known and often spoken about, but I've had dreadful trouble with a very dry mouth and throat. I only learned on Friday from my dentist, that chemo can detrimentally affect saliva glands and production is often vastly reduced to the extent that patients like me have to use artificial stuff. Has anyone else suffered from this kind of thing? Did it eventually get better? My dentist seems to think it will be just another consequence of treatment I will have to learn to manage. Not a lot to ask, I suppose, but quite troublesome.
