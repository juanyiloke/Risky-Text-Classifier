ProteinI rarely post, but read the forum and thought I would share one of ways of staying well.  I have been on medication for MDD for over 30 years and have found having adequate protein in my diet is one of the ways I stay "steady".  I read a book several years ago "Potatoes not Prozac" and dabbled with it everyone now and then.  I began to realise how much steadier I felt when having adequate protein for 3 meals a day.  It is based on an alchol recovery program (I dont drink).  I dont do all of the steps, just adequate protein 3 times a day. This in additon to the meds.
