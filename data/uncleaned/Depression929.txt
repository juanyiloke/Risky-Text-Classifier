I used to think depression was for "lazy people".......before you go and yell at me, I don«t anymore!!I think I was really defensive at the beginning of therapy when the issue if I was depressed or not came up. I never wanted to have depression, because I felt like being depressed meant basically not strong enough or not ambitious enough to fight it, to be lethargic and not get up to work.Today, I see it very differently. I know that for a long time I was depressed during which time I worked and worked and worked and it was all sooo strenuous because I was doing it with the weight of depression on me. I realize that being depressed doesn«t mean lying around, it means feeling bad.I think that lots of people that are working too much or with a not good attitude are depressed. I think many people that are too hard on themselves and do too much are depressed.For me, realizing when I am depressed is a good thing, because then you realize that the way you are feeling hasn«t anything to do with you or the circumstance, necessarily, but "just" depression.It has helped me to see, that the world is always the same. Only when you are depressed you see it black and white.ÊSo when I am feeling bad or having a bad phase, it helps to remember that this may be another depressive episode and not to get myself down but to think, what can I do to reverse it...I«m not sure where I am going with this post. I guess I«m saying, sometimes despite my best efforts, I«m depressed and that«s okay.Also, I want to tell other people, that it can get better! And when you are feeling really low and really bad, remember that it«s your illness, not the world, not you. And there«s a way out of it.
