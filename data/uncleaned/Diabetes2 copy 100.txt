tablets for type 2 diabetes   I was diagnosed about 4 months ago with type 2 diabetes. I have been losing weight by following a low GI diet and increasing my exercise. My first Hb1Ac test was 8.1. I know the ideal is 7 or under. My doctor has mentioned taking tablets to reduce the reading but I would prefer to try and lose more weight first to see if this helps further. I have lost 16.5 kg since last August at a steady rate.What do others think about taking metformin and can you ever reduce your readings enough to stop taking it?
