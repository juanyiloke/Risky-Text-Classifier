Could this be Asthma or something else?________________________________________Hey all, I posted about this a while back with other symptoms, but it's a bit different now.In early August, I had a few symptoms. Shortness of breath, sore throat, chest tightness and just being tired all the time. I dealt with it for a few days and decided to go into the doctor's. I had mutliple tests done, a chest x-ray, blood tests, all that stuff. Everything came back normal, but they did say I had a slight fever at 99f, but they couldn't find out what it was.Fast forward to late August and I feel a little better, the only thing still bothering me is the shortness of breath, and it's improved a little, but it's still really annoying. Would anyone know what this is? Also, about a few days before I started having these symptoms in early August, I was playing with a relative's cat for a while and I must've been allergic to him because I was sneezing like crazy and couldn't breath well.Could that be what's happening? I don't think it would still be affecting me if I'm not holding the cat anymore, right? Sorry for the wall of text, just hoping someone can help me out here. Thanks in advance.
