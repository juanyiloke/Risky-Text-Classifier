Sugars in foodsNo wonder I have problems cooking low-carb meals using ready produced materials -a jar of pasta sauce contains 6 cubes of sugar ! See for a press article.Now I love cooking, nearly as much as I love eating and have found that the only way to accurately cook a low-carb meal is to use fresh produce and make my own sauces, breads etc etc Eating out is a minefield as I never have any idea what the carbs are for a meal in most restaurants.Another rant, but associated, is why are there NO low-carb crisps and crackers (for cheese)? One of my favourite evening snacks was a few crackers and mature cheddar. I can have the cheddar but now I have to use an iceberg lettuce instead of crackers - nice but not the same
