do i need help???I have been suffering with unusual eating habits for three years now. I starve, binge and purge! I don't think I need help because I don't do it very often, I am able to switch my eating habits so my family don't get suspicious. But lately it's getting harder, I have started self harming again and I'm frightened that I might actually have something wrong with me, this is my last hope, I don't know what to do...do I need help because a part of me feels  like I can keep this a secret for longer.
