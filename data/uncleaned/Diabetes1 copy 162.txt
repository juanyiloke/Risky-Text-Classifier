Said I had a thickening of the lining of my womb my hb1c is 7.9 not great but not drastic, recently been put on insulin pump I queried with the nurse ( as was calling everyday to see how I was getting in with the pump) and she'd never heard of it being related to diabetes! I called dr went mad told because of my age I'm not in the 'bracket ' for cancer have to wait another 3 month for another scan :/ I'm on the mini pill ( no break) T1 for 36 year no complications any one else had this problem or anyone else got any ideas?
