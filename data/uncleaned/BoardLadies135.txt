so ladies, is your OH like your father?Just wondering....ÊThey say women look for traits in men that are similar to their fathers... which I assume is the case when you have had a good relationship with your old man.ÊJust realising more and more how similar my OH and dad actually are. In a good way of course, my aul lad is a sweetheart.ÊI think the sun shines out of my dad's behind and would have always loved to have the kind of relationship my parents have but didn't think a modern day man could come close to him.ÊTurns out in my case, its true... I was looking for someone like my aul lad.ÊSounds weird, how about yas?
