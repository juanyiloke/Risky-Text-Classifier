ÊOffensive video about schizophrenia wins award!I watched a youtube video a while back entitled 'this is schizophrenia'.I found it deeply offensive.The maker of the video said he wanted to educate and inform people.Seems to me that he is actually getting off on taking the piss out of schizophrenics and he actually won some sort of award for it.I'm just wondering what other people think about this video and to see if I have got it out of proportion.The video was made by some college students and was given the thumbs up by their psychology teacher and other adults.It was then posted on youtube.I wont say why I was offended until I hopefully get some responses from fellow members on here so I'm not telling anyone what to think and trying to influence peoples responses.Sorry I havent got a link but the video is called 'this is schizophrenia' and his user name is 'jakealicious'The video is 16 minutes long so I don't suppose many people will have the time to watch it.But if you do I'd really appreciate your feedback in this thread and if you want you could leave a comment on youtube.
