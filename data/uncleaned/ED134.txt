more serious than I thought?In my session with my counselor today, she mentioned the idea of pursuing further treatment several times. This is the worst my need to control has gotten and the second week that she has asked if my goal is to end up having to leave school because I'm in the hospital or what chances I may not have if I continue the way I am. It was the first time that she actually brought up the possible need of dropping the semester to go somewhere for help. I know that I'm not at the best place, but am I really at that bad of a place? The thought of being so incapable of taking care of myself that I would even need to give up school to get help is so scary... How serious does the situation have to be to have more intensive treatment mentioned quite a bit? Because I feel like I just passed over this really scary line and I'm not sure what to do next. I want to fight back but only feel worse when I do... Help?
