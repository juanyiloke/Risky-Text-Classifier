ÊHas anyone tried Sulpiride?I am currently on Abilify 30mg and Citalopram 30mg and my voices/demons are getting worse. They are telling me to commit suicide and I don't like what they say to me and what's happening. My psych team is monitoring me and they've prescribed me lorazepam for stress/anxiety and zopiclone for sleep. I get a good nights sleep but soon as I wake these demons are harassing me from the word go.I don't know what to do? Has anyone else tried Sulpiride? Any side effects? I'm concerned it's going to make me put on lots of weight
