People keep telling me how slim i am for my age but i know i'm at least 2 stone over weight and i cant stand it. I know i'm not anorexic because i'm not underweight im overweight and no matter how much i try to go without food i just cant   and end up bingeing at things ive tried to avoid for days. I dont even fit into the bullimic category because i dont even have the will power to make myself vomit after every meal   i'm a total failure even at that so, i take laxatives, slimming pills...i even take anti depressants partly because of my feeling so low but mainly because it says one of the side effects is loss of weight. I'm a single mum and am so worried that my daughter will pick up my eating habits   I have a problem with my bowels and am scared to see the consultant i've been refered to because i know they'll make me eat lots of fibre etc. I am currently off work with stress, i've just finished reading Claire Beekens book, my body my enemy and it helped enough for me to find this site
