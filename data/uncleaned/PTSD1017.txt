Hi everyone. I had trauma 8 years ago. I am suffering from really bad hypervigilance, have for years. Jump out of my skin with noise. Constant underlying fear. Never feel safe really. Cry almost every night at bed. Crying right now. My body just can't 'let go'. I feel I always need to be alert to stay mentally 'safe'. Sleep problems, my body/mind is too scared too sleep. I soooo want peace and safety in my life. I live in fear, mentally and physically for years now. What have you people done that has helped?
