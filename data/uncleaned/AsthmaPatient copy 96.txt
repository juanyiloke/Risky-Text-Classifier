I have been dealing with a case of chronic bronchitis for over a month now.Posted 2 months agoSymptoms include slight wheezing and tightness, periodic post-nasal drip, and some mucous discharge that I have difficulty expectorating. Saw my GP and have had the spirometry test performed twice, but he doesn't seem to think it's COPD related. I feel the symptoms every day, and they seem to worsen during the day - nighttimes I'm generally better. My GP has prescribed a Flovent inhaler, fluticasone propionate nose spray, and an antihistamine (levocetirizine dihydrochloride) once a day for about a week now. The Flovent seems to aggravate the sysmptoms so I stopped using it. The other prescriptions don't seem to do much. I'll be seeing my GP this Monday. Could these symptoms just be the result of allergies? We've had a bad season where I llive, but I've never felt like this before. Does this sound like asthma? I am a 62 year old male and was once diagnosed with asthma about thirty years ago. Could this be a recurrence? Thanks!
