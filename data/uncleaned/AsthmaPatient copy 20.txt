Whistle at end of exhale  3  Basically, at the end of each breath, I can sometimes hear a whistle noise; it's like the noise your nose makes when breathing through it, only this whistle is coming from my throat or chest.I've had mild asthma since I was born (never been on steroids or had an attack) and smoked for 6 years. Quit 8 weeks ago. I've had this "whistle" for about 5 years!! My Doctor and Asthma Nurse can't hear it on auscilation.  I also had a chest x-ray in August last year for a non-related reason; it was normal and "healthy".  Peak flow is normal and steady. Any ideas what this "whistle" thing could be? It doesn't really sound like a wheeze; but if it is, why aren't inahlers helping? Should I be concerned? I'm 22.
