I am a survivor!!¥	Hi all,¥	I am a bit of a lurker currently as I finished, chemo, radio, 4 lots of surgery and now letrozole. I am currently planning my DIEP in June and hoping to have 'the other one off' but have private insurance so waiting to see what they will and wont pay for. (Any experience of this welcome).¥	My reason for posting today is that my children are running race for life at school in a few weeks and on my(11 years) daughters sponsorship form, she wrote 'I race for life for - "my mum" and in brackets she wrote SURVIVOR!! It really made me think as I occasionally have moments where I forget that that all happened to me (and them) just over a year ago, and is still happening to some extent. But what I really wanted to say was, in the words of Destinys Child "I am a survivor" and no matter what your journey and how hard it is going through it, keep strong!!! Would love to hear from all you other survivors out there! It can be done!¥	Much love to all no matter where you are on this nasty (but life changing) journey. Keep your head high and dont forget to breathe!!¥	x Julie
