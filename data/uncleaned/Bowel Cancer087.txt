Life SongsNow that life has a different meaning, most old songs I hear also have taken on another dimension.Not only do I remember the words, but also remember the people I shared that part of my life with, the smells, the clothes, the weather ,,,,,If I listen to my ipod I can transform myself to a thousant places each of which I could write a book about !!!I just wondered if others have experienced this and if so, what is there most compelling song.Mine goes back to the summer of 1976,,,the song Mississippi I can still see my student flat, thred bare carpets, large victorian windows wedged open with books, long haired people with funny spelling cigs and the warm warm evenings ,,,,,,
