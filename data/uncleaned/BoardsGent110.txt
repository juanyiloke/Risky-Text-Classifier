A good WalletHello Chaps Like a fool i lost my wallet over the weekend thankfully there wasn't much cash in it, just bank cards and other cards that can and have been replaced,. Now the thing that really annoyed me was losing the wallet itself, It was a beauty ,nice leather one, small, tidy and neat. I bought while in Italy a few years back, My question to you good folks is where would i get a nice one from now, any recommendations Thanks
