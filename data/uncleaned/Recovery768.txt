Does diet affect depression?I was wondering if diet had an effect on depression. I know I could look this up on google but frankly i'm not bothered to read a long article.So for about a month I didn't eat any fruit (except for bananas but they don't really count) because there was no fruit in the house and I wasn't bothered to run to the shops and do some exercise (I'm lazy alright). For this month I felt more depressed than usual and just didn't know why. however for the past week or so with the start of mandarin season I have been eating lots of fruit and I my depression has seemed to ease off a bit. I was wondering if there was any correlation between the two or if it was just a coincidence. also has anyone else seen any similar mood change with diet change?
