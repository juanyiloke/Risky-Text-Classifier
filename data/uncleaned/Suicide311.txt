Suicide because Hair LossI have been suicidal for almost 5 years now and it is due to hair loss. Having a full head of hair is absolutely integral to my ability to feel handsome and comfortable in my own skin, and to my enjoyment of life. I noticed my hair loss very late so no amount of preventative medication or any other type of current treatment can really help me out at this point. Not to mention, I was on anti-depressants for a number of years, which I believe triggered the premature onset of my hair loss, a fact that I didn't even know until it was too late. I have also experienced terrible side effects from finasteride, which is the most common medication to prevent hair loss today. And I am not about to wear a wig. Life is just not worth living anymore and I always wish I would just fall asleep and never wake up. I cry out to God to relieve my pain and He does absolutely nothing. I don't know where else to turn or what else to do. Life is just hopeless.
