Stigmatic Name Calling SystemThe other aspect that I want to talk about is what happens when a PERSON gets in the system. First, they are tagged with labels like “Schizophrenic” (you don't call cancer patients “Cancer” do you?). This label starts out as name calling and when the person suffering is broken down enough they start calling themselves the name. The other name call they give us and is bandied around is “psychotic”, makes one wonder about the drugs they call “anti-psychotic”? So there is a passive-aggressive stigma which results in name calling that starts with psychiatry and is extended out to the mass media and general public. Its obvious. Some suffers are so brainwashed they think the name call (diagnosis) is more important that symptom resolution. Most psychiatrist over medicate their patients, in attempt to give them symptom relief. The net effect however is just like any drug, you have side effects such as sedation, insomnia, akinthesia, disconnected thoughts, etc. What little ability some may have to work is further restricted by the drugs themselves. Without real resolution of the psychosis or because of the debilitating effects of the side effects, many schizophrenics end up being supported by their families or the government, which ensures poverty for most. This in turn engenders a sense of worthlessness and failure that can lead to illegal or illicit drug use or suicide. So standing around and saying nothing about any of this is tantamount to being in Germany circa the 1930s, with all the name calling, the filling of ghettos, and destruction of lives.
