 Have you ever seen a nutritionist?What stage of your disorder/recovery was it?Did it help at all?How long did you see him/her?What was it like for you?When I was in the hospital 4 years ago being treated for my ed (and a boatload of other problems) they assigned me a nutritionist. She explained a few things about why my body was doing certain things, but I only saw her twice (other things/problems got in the way).Well now, (obviously) I'm contemplating seeing one.I have no appetite thanks to some new meds and I really do NOT want to go back down that road again, even though I'm not exactly upset about the weight I've been losing.Just wondering what it's like to actually see one.
