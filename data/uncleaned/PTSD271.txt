How to reintegrate?by certavietvici » Wed May 07, 2014 3:36 amBackstory: I have C-PTSD/MDD/SAD/AspergersStatus: currently in therapy and not terribly stable (but emotionally regulated)My question is simple.. how do you reintegrate with society? Is it possible after a lifetime of trauma?I isolate for protection as well as comfort (introvert), but I am terribly lonely. Sometimes I will reach out and try to connect with others, but it almost always goes horribly wrong (due to social anxiety/stigma), so I retreat to my cocoon. I don't have any friends who I can talk to and my therapist is the only person I leave the house for. I was recently asked to think of ways I can resume some semblance of a life. I didn't have the answer. I read that relationships are a good area to build trust up again, but I don't have that luxury. I don't have a family to support me either. I've been stuck in this hole for too long and I feel like I need to make a choice - to either let this thing win or fight back. I just don't know how.. and the gears barely move no matter how hard I push.Any advice would be much appreciated.
