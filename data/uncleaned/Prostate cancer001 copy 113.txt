Mets have gone ! - almost 5 years on Well I have to say I'm very impressed that hospital have done me proud. PET/CT scan last September - showing no sign of live cancer cells in lymph nodes - 4 years after first going to GP with symptoms and diagnosis of psa of 1,100 - gleason 4+5 with extensive lymph node mets.But with psa still creeping up this year they decided to do a full set of CT, bone scan  a couple months ago and last week a full body MRI scan taking 90 minutes. The result of this last MRI still shows no active mets outside the prostate and Seminal vesicles.With no active mets - i dont qualify for any trials just yet.I had earlier asked if RT was now an option, but they wanted these addition scans - but not the onco consultant has said that he considers it worth a short set of RT sessions on the prostate and SV's to knock it back and et psa down from 12.He said I have done extremely well on the HT this last 5 years and he was talking of further HT keeping me where I am for two plus years or more, and then plenty of other of options.So obviously I'm well pleased with this. How many others here have had such a good reversal from such an advanced set of mets??. And anyone with experience of doing RT after all this?
