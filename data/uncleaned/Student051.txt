Thoughts of changing courses after 1st year?by JacksamwillHello there, after doing Accounting and Finance for the academic year so far, I feel as though i would be better suited to Computer Science, but there are reasons for this. Firstly, I do enjoy the mathematical side to Accountancy (which I heard is the basis of Computer Science) but it involves a lot of text based modules (Eg Economics) which even though I am averaging a first (92% in Economics), I feel as though I am not suited and don't get much enjoyment out of them. Secondly, I spend more or less every night using my computer, playing games with friends and even last night spending time overclocking my new CPU, and even though I know Computer Science wouldn't be tasks like this, I feel I would enjoy spending time behind a screen as I have been for the past years. My A Levels should allow me to change directly within the university, (ABB in Maths, Chemistry and Physics) but there are alot of factors to think about, financial and the fact of wasting a year on a different course. Is there anyone who can give me any insight on what it entails (whether it be personal or financial) Thanks
