Life is getting worseEvery year that I have plans they always go downhill. I was supposed to graduate college by now but have run out of money and have another semester to go. I'm 23 and feel way to old to not be having a job already but no one will hire me.ÊI was homeless before but not under the bridge type homeless where I think I'm heading. I don't have any friends either and just think people in general do not like me.ÊDo some people just have bad luck while others are luckier to get themselves out?
