2 Year Milestone reachedWell, I've reached the key 2 year milestone after my main op which removed my single T3N1M0 cancerous tumour with an "All Clear" from a CT scan Wednesday before last.I had never been all that anxious about the results from my previous tests before, be they scans, biopsies, blood tests etc.But for some weird reason, this one got to me.I could not stop thinking about the contrast dye injection, the CT scan itself and what the results might be, right from immediately after I got home from the scan until the afternoon of the previous Friday, when I could wait no more and called my CNS team's number. The lead CNS recognised my voice immediately and after the usual banter, told me there were no recurrent signs visible.I followed through to the proper consultation last Wednesday to go through the full report as well as having an examination of my abdomen and had my weight taken as well.Then, as my last colonoscopy (July 2013) found a polyp which although benign and was a small (2 mm) flathead and therefore I had expected the next colonoscopy to be in two years time, my hopes were dashed when I was told it would be this July 2014, just one year after!!! I am not at all keen on the moviprep and the clearing out process before hand! I'm not too bothered about the colonoscopy itself.Funny. Some would be happier having more frequent scans and tests. I guess I'm just proving we've all got different perspectives on things!!!I'm to remain on 6 monthly checkups/consultations. The next will follow up on my colonoscopy results then the next on my CT scan in a year's time.
