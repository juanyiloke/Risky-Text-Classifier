Social Mobility (Alan Milburn)So the government's Social Mobility Tzar, former Labour minister, Alan Milburn, has rightly concluded that working people are bearing the brunt of the cost of living, not just the unemployed. He then goes on to trot out the same mantra that we have heard from all three parties, that wealthy pensioners have been relatively unscathed during the recession and the government should look again at withdrawing 'bus passes and free t.v. licences from them.My question to him and the three main parties is : "How do you define a 'wealthy pensioner' and where do you set the threshold for the withdrawal of such benefits?"ÊPensioners be warned, have no doubt, the axeing of universal benefits is on its way !!
