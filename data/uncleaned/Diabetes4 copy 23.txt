Biotrust IC-5 pillsI'm usually sceptical about pills to help weight loss or diabetes.  However, I decided to give Biotrust IC-5 a whirl because I saw in a couple of reviews that they had a positive effect on blood glucose.  They are bloody expensive and while you are buying they try to get you to buy other pills as well. Came over from the USA in less than a week.  The results have been a bit strange really.  They seem to lower my late afternoon blood glucose (which is always the lowest for me anyway).  The readings at that time have been in the 4s and then today (after 5 days) 3.9: normally the readings are 6-8. BG at other parts of the day are a bit lower, but I am still low carbing and taking my meds (except I've had to skip the Gliclazide now and again to avoid the possibility of a hypo).  I feel also that my appetite is suppressed - I just don't feel hungry.  I may have lost a couple of pounds as well.  So are they any good?  Too soon to call, but definitely worth trying as a T2 not yet reached the insulin stage.  The issue for me is that do they only reduce blood glucose only when you are taking them, or are there long term effects as well.  My first readings of the day have been a bit variable too: they have been over 10 sometimes and under 8 sometimes.  I'll keep you posted.
