Understanding about carbshi all was wondering if some could give me a rough guide about low carbs,I have had some good advice about some books to read on other posts but whilst I wait for them to arrive I thought I'd ask for some tips to get a head start.Since diagnoses a month ago I've be monitoring carbs which sugar trying to keep mainly under 5 % but after reading lots of posts I'm not sure this is quite right I've cut out all cakes biscuits sweets etc but I'm still eating potatoes wholemeal bread pasta and basmati rice with most meals as it was suggested by nurse to do so,so not quite sure how much I need to reduce these so any advice would be great  X
