Querry Asthma Im 14 and i think i have asthma. I am healthy and play lots of sport but the problem is is i have to stop often to catch my breath. Constantly, i get unsatifactory breaths, (it doesnt feel like air is going down) I've got to the point where i hate it. The dodgy breaths have been going on since i was 11 but has gotten worse since then. My mum said she wouldnt take me to the doctors but its becoming a pain in my life. :? Could anyone help me out in this situation. Im also a first aider and i know what the symptoms are and mine are consistant with quite a few of them. I also get out of breath alot when walking and talking :?: :?: :?:
