New to Asthma and feeling a little scared Hi everyone, about 8 months ago (age 32)I was told I have asthma, I was given a blue inhaler and have been left on my own to deal with it. I've been reading the posts on here and people seem to really understand what type of asthma they have, I didn't know there were different types! Ive been admitted into hospital with asthma, I cant lie down to sleep because I end up coughing so much that its feels like my head will explode, talking causes me to become short of breath, the cold and exercise cause attacks. this is getting so bad I having at least two attacks a day, more when im at work, i'm going through two blue inhalers a month, im trying to get into to see my doctor but I don't know am I just making a fuss? is this how it is o live with asthma?
