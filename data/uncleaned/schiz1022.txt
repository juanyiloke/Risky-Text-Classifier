Memory loss and moreI have a question for some of you. I'm schizophrenic and I've been diagnosed since October of 2012. Ever since I found housing it felt as if my brain was being physically attacked by the people and voices in my head. They began systematically began draining and ripping thoughts from my head. It's not just the thoughts that I'm missing but also the ability to think certain ways. I haven't regained memory in over a year and a half. I wanted to know if anyone else has suffered memory loss due to schizophrenia. I'm also feeling tons of pressure on my head and body. I don't know where it's coming from or how it's possible but it feels like the pressure is preventing me from speaking often and thinking critically. Has anyone else experienced pressure due to schizophrenia?
