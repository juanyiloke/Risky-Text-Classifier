Off the rocks for a while, still on the road Hi AllI want to pass on bit of good news.I am almost exactly 2 years post LRP and the subsequent and almost immediate detection of biochemical failure and subsequent salvage radiotherapy 18 Months ago.I went to see my my oncologist today to get the results of the test I had a fortnight ago and it has come back down to undetectable (my hospitals definition of undetectable is < 0.01) from 0.02 4 months ago.While I managed to keep the demons packed away since Septembers test they got out after the last test and have plaguing me  for the last fortnight.I wonder if I have seen the effects of the RT working over an extended period after the treatment (I am now 17 months post RT).I can - will - come off ADT in May and that is my contribution to Radicals done with, they will then follow me up for 8 more years. After the next 4 monthly check-up it drops to 6 monthly, I think until year 5 then annually assuming I don't hit another rocky patch.Bri - if you read this good luck for your next test, though I don't post much now I have been following your story.Good luck and best wishes to everyone suffering, or supporting someone, with this foul, rotten disease that brings us all together on this site.
