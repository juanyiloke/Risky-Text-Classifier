This discussion has been recommended 0 times.In 2006 my grandmother died. This was a traumatic experience as she was healthy and strong. Her death was sudden and unexpected. This caused my chest to become so tight that the Drs had to give me nebulizers to open my airways. They later said i have asthma. Without warning my chest would just lock tight and I was unable to breathe. Since 2006 my chest has got so bad that I have been given the brown pump, antibiotics and prednisolone literally every other month. I am now producing excessive phylem and a gurrling sound. The phylem is always green despite antibiotics. My recent episode is being admitted to A&E where I was injected IV with aminophyline 250 mg & Magnisum 2g. I've been to the Hospital today (Tuesday 28/8/2012) The Drs have ruled bronchietasis via CT scan. They say its Asthma. All the Asthma suffers I hav eknow in the past do not produce excessive green/brown phylem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated?
