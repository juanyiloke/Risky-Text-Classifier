How To Put An 'emergency'-lid On This Thing?I'm not entirely certain if this thread really belongs in this subforum, the 'Therapy'-section or elsewhere, so please feel free to move if necessary, mods. Here's the deal: Certain circumstances beyond my control have been filling up ye ole battered 'cup' pretty steadily over the course of the last three days. It's not a situation I could remove myself from, and the rising stress-levels are due to absolutely nothing but my own overthinking ways - which, in itself, is not unusual at all.What is, however, is that the coping-mechanisms that have saved me from my mental spillage time and time again are failing me now, and they're doing so spectacularly.I've tried breathing/feeling exercises, yoga, meditation, handicrafts (THAT went particularly well...) working my body to failure and/or, admittedly, punching things.One or all of these usually do manage to stop or at least slow the rising tide, but this time, they only seem to make things worse. The rage at the source of this stress only seems to get stronger the more aggressively OR peacefully I try to get it under control.So...before I really am at risk of becoming a homicidal maniac because I run colder than ever, I was wondering if anyone can think of any "emergency-stop buttons" I could try still? Stuff that doesn't require a lot of practice, yet isn't on the list up there. I'm not particularly fond of feeling the fuse burn and being unable to stop it at a time where I wouldn't be 100% certain what happens when this thing explodes. (Failing that - does anybody have contact details for Thor? A whack on the head with Mjolnir might do the trick. )No, seriously, any help would be be appreciated. Whatever it may be, however silly it may sound, I'm willing to give almost anything short of animal sacrifice a try.Thanks, guys and gals.
