New Year, New meHello all you lovely peopleIt is great to share the experience and I am hoping someone can help me out. A year after diagnosis of stage 4 BC with mets, I have undergone chemo with unexpected good results, a tumour removal, most mets cleared up and a reversal of stoma. Why then am I sitting on the cusp of the New Year feeling worse than I have through most of the last year. I am of course elated at the outcome of things and generally physically have bounced back well after each round of new treatments, but right now feel very out of sorts over the whole thing. A sort of who am I, what now, feeling? Is this usual, how to move on, would welcome any ideas.
