40 years40 years nearly of having terrible food issues. I'm 50 years old. I just told someone else a couple months ago. Never told anyone before. What causes eating disorders? It's really bad now. I am caught in a binge purge cycle. I'd go years when it would be kept at bay. But it's worse now than ever.I need to interrupt the cycle. I get hungry. Eat. Feel guilty. Over eat. Purge. Then get hungry again. I Know it will get easier when Ibreak the cycle, I just can't seem to do it. I'm trying again. I'm so messed up and afraid to eat.I'm pretty depressed. I'm seeing a therapist and a nutritionist. I feel like quitting it all because it doesn't seem like anything will help. I'm wasting their time.Why do people become bulimic?
