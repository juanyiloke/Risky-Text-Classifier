Very Frightened I was diagnosed with prostate cancer last week. The consultant said that the cancer had probably started 5 years ago but the symptoms only started a few weeks ago and were mis-diagnosed as sciatica. They have put me on hormone treatment - Cyproterone Acetate 300mg per day - but I don't know what is next in line. I have a pain in my right backside which I am assuming is from the cancer having spread, but I don't know.I'm so frightened. I am 56 and have always been so very fit. It hasn't helped that I have recently split up with my wife and I'm living out of a single rented room. So my stress levels are through the roof.I don't know anything about what is in store, what questions to ask, whether I can do anything to reduce or stop this disease.
