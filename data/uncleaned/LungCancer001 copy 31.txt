  Nice to meet youHello everyone,My name is Valerie Warburton, this is my first time to the Cancer Forum  I wantto stay as positive as I can, my journey is about to happen. I have a mass on my left lower lobe, adenocarcinoma don't know what size it is, they did not tell me, I should have asked, to be honest I think I was afraid to ask, since it fit into the lower left lobe, maybe not that big. This seem to be the only thing that lit up on the Pet scan, they did take some lymph node samples, to see if it has spread. I should get the results of those test soon, I had a EUS by my lungs and they checked for lymph nodes there .I have been through some things and got rid of one Doctor because of things he did not do. I think now I have better Doctors, I see the Chemotheropist this tuesday, I am a little iffy about radiation, but I see that other people have had it. Well I would love any comments, I am hear to learn, since Doctors don't seem to say much. My port has stabbed me at times, but it is doing well. Thanks Valerie
