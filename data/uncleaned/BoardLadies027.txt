PMS is no excuse... the title of this thread is deceiving.For the second time in 2 weeks, I have been asked (by two different lads) if I was on PMS because I sounded snappy ...this after the guy offended me in some way.I am sorry, but is this a standard go-to excuse for some lads to use after they do something wrong or wonder why women get upset? Surely it can't be THEIR fault, after all  - it must be a woman's menstrual cycle! Has this ever happened to you? Are woman not allowed to have any emotions except cheery ones, without being labeled? Is this a convenient excuse to curb the blame of their own bad behaviour?Does such an accusation offend your female sensibilites the way it does mine?Is there really such a general consensus that women cannot be in control of their faculties every day of the month?
