I can't stop binge eating...So here's a little background information about me...I had been overweight all of my childhood years up until I was 14. At 14 I had suffered from bulimia, in which I lost weight. I had on-and-off binge eating and purging cycles that occurred at least once every week. My parents decided I should go into counseling where I was finally I was able to recover. But shortly after I became anorexic. Then in turn I lost weight again, leaving my weight to go slightly under normal weight.Now I can't stop binging. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm so afraid to even look at my weight. I've been binge eating and having urges to purge. I don't know what to do anymore. Is there anyway to stop this? I've been telling myself not to overeat to the point where my stomach feels so full, but it's so hard to stop. HELP!:(
