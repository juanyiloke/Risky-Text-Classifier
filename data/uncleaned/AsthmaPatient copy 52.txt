Asthma and Antibiotics? Is it ok to take 'Septerin' for one month? My husband was prescribed this as well as one month of 'Ventolin' tablets for asthma. Last week, he went to a clinic where he had to do a sputum test. (Unfortunately, they don't have any x-ray machines where he is situated.)Apparently, the sputum test revealed that my husband has the onset of asthma. (He has never had any breathing difficulties like this before.).My husband has been coughing a lot, especially at night and has a blocked nose so I'm guessing the Septerin is used to clear up an infection perhaps? However, what worries me the most is taking antibiotics with Ventolin for a whole month. Can you take antibiotics for a month? I'm worried it will cause him harm in the long run   .
