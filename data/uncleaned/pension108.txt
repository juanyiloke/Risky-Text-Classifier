Little Harbour HospiceI've just spent a lovely weekend with my family at Little Harbour where my disabled grandson has respite.Ê His brother and sister love it so much, and there is always a sibling working who takes care of them whilst the carers are dealing with Callum, allowing the parents and grandparents to just sit back and relax.Ê Here are a couple of photos.Ê My two grandchildren who were dressed as pirates and were waiting for Abby, the sibling working to take them to the zoo.Ê The picture was taken just outside the door of our room.The other picture is of myself and hubby and our 'special' grandson, who has loved every minute of the attention he receives at Little Harbour.Ê These hospices all over the country do a great job and their dedication to the special children is first class.Ê On entering you just leave all the worries and stress behind you, unfortunately, when you have to leave you pick it all up again at the gate.
