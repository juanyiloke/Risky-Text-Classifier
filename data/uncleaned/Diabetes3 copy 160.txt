Novorapid and accuchek expert meter questionsHi,I am going to be swapped on to Novorapid. I will be started on a ratio of 1 unit to 10g of carbs. This would mean that for pasta or rice and chilli say, I would be looking at 7 or 8 units of Novorapid -which sounds a lot to me, but advice on whether this sounds anything like "normal" (within the realms of everyones' diabetes being different etc) would be appreciated.I have also been advised that as this insulin is 'very rapid acting' I should inject it after eating - is this standard with novorapid? It is making me feel somewhat daunted incase it is so rapid acting I hypo before the food kicks in etcI have also been given an accuchek expert meter and am wondering what to put in as the 'max bolus'? Do people set this exactly at their highest dose or allow a couple of 'spare' units - ie; if my max bolus is 8 for meals, should I enter 10 in the meter as the 'max bolus' setting?Sorry this is a bit long. Your time and advice is appreciated.BettyB
