When to take morning insulin.Hopefully a straight forward question for those who use insulin. My father is type II, and takes insulin. He wakes up, measures his BG, takes his insulin and then goes downstairs to make his breakfast. Comments, suggestions and recommendations are invited please. I'm not sure what sort of insulin and I'm a bit concerned because I've now discovered that he eats an evening meal at 17:30, then does his insulin a bit later, not sure of any snacks and then complains of low BG in the morning bordering on hypo sometimes. Sorry if the info is vague, getting the information out my dad is more difficult than getting blood out of a stone.
