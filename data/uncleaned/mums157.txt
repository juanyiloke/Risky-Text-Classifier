Our 19-month-old twins are generally pretty good about dummy use as they are only allowed them for sleep, but recently it's been getting worse. They each now feel the need to have two dummies for going to sleep (one in the mouth, one as a backup, and they freak out if you try to clip it on) and they have started  waking up in the night when they lose one. What is causing this behaviour (it started a few weeks ago after we got back from holiday), and does it mean it's time to ditch the dummies? I tried this evening to put them down with just their lovies and blankies, but they both screamed and screamed for about half an hour until I finally went in and relented. Is 18 months a particularly bad time to wean from dummies? If so, when is the best time to do so? They're still too young to understand what's going on, so the whole 'dummy fairy' thing wouldn't really work right now I don't think.Anyone have experience in this and want to shed some light on the subject?
