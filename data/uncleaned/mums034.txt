I'm ebf my 5wo and heard that I need to give dd bottles of expressed milk now and again to get her used to it. I have an electric double expresser that I'd like to use, but I'm confused about when to do it? should I express when she sleeps (2-3 hours tops) to have milk to give her later? or would that mean she wont have enough milk when she wakes? or would it even increase my supply? I'm curious to try giving it to her in the middle of the night - is it more common to do this? might it help her sleep?!any advice welcomed!!
