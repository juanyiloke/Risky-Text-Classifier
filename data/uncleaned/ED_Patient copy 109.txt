Hope for BulimicsI was a bulimic for over 5 years and have now not binged or purged for over 15 years. There is hope :DDuring my worst period I was also purging at least once a day and felt so helpless to stop I was suicidal. I did go and see a psychologist and therapist and lucky for me the therapist was the right fit - If you have not found yours yet, keep looking!! I was diagnosed with manic depression and was put onto a course of anti-depressants. It took months to work through the issues and I obtained some tools to stop myself from starting the spiral into negative thinking that then leads to the bulimic behaviour. I do still 'snack' frequently, but like one of the other postings mentioned, exercising helps keep my weight and bad food feelings under control.I believe that everyone has addictions, some are more harmful than others and we all need to figure out what the triggers are for us individually in order to control our (sometimes distorted) thoughts.Please do not feel alone and do not feel guilty (of course this doesn't help stop the habit, but makes it worse) - like I said everyone has their issues, it just comes out differently in different people.Keep looking for the solution that will help you...it is out there!
