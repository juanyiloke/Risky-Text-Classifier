Ênew to forumHello everyone, just wanted to introduce myself and explain my situationWell I first started experiencing some severe feelings of what I thought were "painfully shy" when I first started 9th grade (I also had a huge transistion in my life (exchanging schools) from NJ to CO but it progressed quickly and symptoms became horrible so I remember drinking for the first time and this had caused me some great relief....soon I find out the horrors of alcoholism it gradually went from drinking here and there at age 17 and then from my 21 on up alcoholism brought me to my knees along with this "mental health issue.. I have spent the last 6-7 years working on substance abuse through inpatient rehab and outside AA and sponsorship. I have now been sober 4 1/2 years still experienceing these severe symptoms. I have multiple diagnoses , and quite the cocktail of medication to take. I am here to talk w/ people and help if i can and as well as maybe get some insight,
