Pseudo ScienceThe above is just a part of the problem. There is a whole host of problems with the system. First and foremost is the erroneous idea that Psychiatrists are doctors. Yes they may have a Doctorate degree and years of schooling, but in practice MOST are nothing short of a drug dealers, that pour drugs they know little about, into people they know even less about. Additionally, the main Bible of psychiatry is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) which is the result of not laboratory research or pathology, but the “disease” \ diagnosis criteria is voted upon by the members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Who has ever heard of the the concept of a disease, its symptoms, and diagnostic criteria being voted upon ? It ONLY happens in meetings for the DSM. Not discussing these facts, is also essentially standing around while pseudo science and quackery over takes and controls the lives of vulnerable people.
