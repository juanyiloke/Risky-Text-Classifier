Civil service- advice on options & progression________________________________________Hi, hope this is okay to post here- have to be careful I remain anon I suppose! I'm a recent start as a CO in the Civil Service and finding it hard going to settle in. The reason I'm putting this in problems is that I'm also having some issues with depression at the minute and this is making the adjustment somewhat worse. I'm not sure I want to be in this department and ideally I'd like to take up part-time third level education in September. However, I'll still be in my probationary period at that point.I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how accommodating the CS can be in allowing this. Can people on probation get workshare easily? Can transfers to other departments or units be made while in probation period? Also, how receptive are they to helping someone with mental health issues during probation- is it something likely to impact on my chances of success at passing probation?I know there is an option to wait until I have 2 years put in then apply for a career break but I would rather not wait that length of time and figure it might be easier to fund education while working? The people I am working with are nice and very friendly but the whole organisation is new to me, so any advice anyone from the Civil/Public service might have is welcome!Thanks.
