ÊPeter Breggin M.D and others like himso I watched and read stuff by Peter Breggin M.D and how psychiatric medications are dangerous. I'm only speaking from my point of view and what i went through cause everyones story is different. way back when psychiatric medications were first coming out a lot of people were thrown into hospitals and drugged. The conditions in these hospitals were horrible you had over population, under staffed, low resources, so often times people were drugged and then forgotten about. that is one extreme then their is the other hand where doctors like Peter Breggin and others who claim that even the bad diagnoses like schizophrenia are caused by the social fabric of ones life breaking down that all they need is a loving family and friends to get back on the right path. Growing up i had a loving family, i had friends who cared, i had a really good support system but this didn't stop me from breaking down and soon being diagnosed with schizophrenia. my parents loved me, my friends loved me, but that didn't stop the voices and the feelings from me turning on them. If it wasn't for my doctor and Pdoc and yes medication i would be dead. My dad and mom isn't to blame or my friends or me its a illness that effects people despite all these things. A cold virus doesn't go away just because your loved and nor do you get it cause your not loved. FOR ME it was both that helped m, it was my Pdoc and my doctor working together with meds that helped me. jumping from one extreme to another isn't going to help anyone both sides have to work together to help. this is just my point of veiw and my story and everyones help is different i know that meds were the best route for me maybe not for some others but everyones story is different.
