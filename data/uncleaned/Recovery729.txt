finaly foundHi Christopher,I don't really know where else to contact you on this site so ive used this section, on Tuesday last I was in a very bad place I was overwhelmed with emotional pain, more so than I have been for quite sometime I phoned your hotline and ended up from their advice at the P.A, mental health unit where I sat for some 7 hours watching other patients in a distressed state of mind, some were quiet some were angry and it got me thinking about the suffering that others were going through some obviously unable to cope with reality and in a worse place than where I was, being absolutely tormented by there problems I felt compassion for them.Then after accessing your poetry section and reading others poetry I could see that although the authors were in a distressing place I could notice that with that outlet and replies sent,  there was a positive feel about it all. I did feel dejected when you didn't publish my "nightmare" but I could understand the validity in your  reasoning, I wish to cause no one distress or harm and I took that onboard gladly and it also helped me to understand myself a lot more. I realized that I do have a lot of compassion and understanding toward my fellow human beings. I have always given rather than taken and to see someone smile gives me a very warm positive feeling, even though it has only been material possessions or giving my seat up on a bus etc. Yesterday when I replied to CMF and got a positive response and being helpful it was like a doorway opened down a very long and empty corridor, one I had been walking for many many years trying all kinds of employment and schooling, I have a Dip. in agriculture, i'm a WH&SO, an undergrad BSc and many other qualifications I have achieved yet  never happy in any of those areas and I could never understand why..Now I do, thanks to yourself and your team and CMF, for today I enrolled with online learning to gain a Dip. in counseling, I feel in my heart that this is what I have been searching for, for a very long time a way to help others the way I have been helped, and I just wanted to thank you all for showing me that door.Regards Rok
