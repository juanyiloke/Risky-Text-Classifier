Why were spinhalers discontinued? What, I hear some of you cry, is a spinhaler? When I was first diagnosed with asthma, back in the late 1960s, I was put on medication called Intal Co. It came in the form of a dry powder contained within clear orange and white capsules (called spincaps). These capsules were put into a small plastic device called a spinhaler which had a mechanism for piercing the capsules; the contents could then be breathed into the lungs on a couple of sharp intakes of breath. After the dose had been inhaled (easy to see through the transparent coating of the capsule), the capsule was removed and the inhaler put away until the next does was required. I was eight when I was first given one of these and I had no trouble using it at all. No spacer was required to help administer the dose and, even better, I knew if I was using it well because of a whizzing sound the spinhaler made when I was inhaling the medication. Simple!!When my medication was changed in my mid twenties (I had moved to a different part of the country and was finding that Intal was not as effective at controlling my asthma as it had been) I was put onto an evohaler, and was somewhat surprised at how much more difficult it was to use. Why, I have asked time and again since then, was the spinhaler discontinued? No doctor, or asthma nurse has been able to give me an answer. So I thought I'd ask on the forum. Anyone out there know the reason?I'm now on an accuhaler.
