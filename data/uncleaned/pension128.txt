Ambulance service.Hello I'm new to this Forum, and, yes I qualify, easily.I just want to tell you of something which I have only just become aware of. My daughter has been a paramedic for over 20 years and I am astonished to hear that the Ambulance Service is NOT considered to be an Emergency Services like the Fire Brigade and the Police service. It is only an Essential Service. Which means that ambulance personnel cannot retire at 55 but have to work until they are 67( I think that is the correct age.) If they retire earlier, they do so at a vastly reduced rate of pension. Also they cannot claim compensation for work related injuries such as ( and it's happened) carrying a 30 stone man down a flight of narrow stairs and sustaining a back injury, or being injured by an alcoholic or drug using individual who they are trying to treat. Yes they get treatment for such injuries but not compensation if it turns out they they have to leave the service due to their condition.ÊIf you feel that you could support the Ambulance Service in their web petition to be treated as an Emergency Service, not an inferior service, I would be eternally grateful.
