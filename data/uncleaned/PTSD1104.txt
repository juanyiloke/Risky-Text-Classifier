IM a Vietnam Vet, was a corpsman in Recon my responsability was care for injured and saving life. I seen much death and injured an from this Im currently seeing 3 VA doctors. 3 to be exact, 2 Psy and a PCP for my military issues. First my Psych. yes comfirmed my severe case of PTSD than after 3 sessions I found out I was diagonised with bi polar secondary to the PTSD. I ask where did this come from. He said not all people get bi polar disorder. Only 20 to 25 % of people can get it from PTSD. It's not and isnt totally generic from other genes. I m now on Social Security Disablied as of March 2010, now seeking my VA Service connection claim filed for PTSD & cant the bi polar becuase it in the same mental part of PTSD so the Bi polar comes 2ndary to the PTSD and supports my case even stronger to win my case for Service Connected PTSD. I have the stressor in my DD-214 showing my medald and conbat action ribbon and that i was such a person to see very tramatic things at 19.
