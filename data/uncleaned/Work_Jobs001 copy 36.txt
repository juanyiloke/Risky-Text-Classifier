  Disciplinary Hearing________________________________________Hi all!Can anyone recommend a good Employment Law Solicitor please? Preferably in the Lucan area although anywhere in Dublin is fine too! PM's welcome.A close friend of mine has a disciplinary hearing in work with allegations of stealing made towards him, he denies this completely. He's been suspended and is waiting on a letter to outline exactly what's involved. Can anyone tell me in these cases is it a good idea to have a solicitor attend the hearing with him. He is extremely distressed right now and has never been through anything like this before. He is not in a union.I've read on some other posts that sometimes these 'letters' will specifically request that solicitors do not accompany employees, only work colleages or union reps. Why is this? I would have a thought an employee at such an important meeting is entitled to have with him or her somebody familiar with the procedure which would be either their TU official or solicitor. Even if the employer has no one else there, you can be sure that the employer has been fully advised and will be working off a script. Should he consult a solicitor now or wait for the letter? How long does the hearing usually take place after he receives the letter?
