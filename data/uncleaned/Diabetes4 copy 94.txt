What should be my next step?I recently had my HbA1c which came out at 7% in old money.  Obviously the nurse thought that was fine.Soon after, my awakening blood glucose started to shoot up from around 8.5 to 10,11,12.  In the mornings, exercise, food or meds don't affect BG at all. Later in the day, fasting, meds, heavy exercise can bring Bg down to 5-6, but the next morning the high BG is there again, and it makes no difference if I eat or don't eat the evening before. Obviously I suffer from the dawn phenomenon, but why the sudden jump and what can I do about it? I'm probably eating 70-100g CHO /day, and I find CHO at very low levels too difficult to stick to. I'm wondering if my beta cells have finally started to give up the ghost, and should I talk to the doc about insulin.  It will be tricky with an HbA1c of 7%, which he'll see as perfectly normal given my circumstances.  What do I try next?
