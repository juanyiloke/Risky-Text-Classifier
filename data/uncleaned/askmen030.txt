Why can't I ever get a new job?2013-05-03, 02:45 AMI have been looking for a new job for two years now and still haven't got one. I already have a job but hate it and want to get out. I don't understand how other people I know, can find jobs now problem and I cannot.When I apply they always ask me when I can start and I tell them that I have to give my current employer two weeks notice while quitting. Since I won't be able to work two full time jobs that is of course. I just feel maybe that's the reason, cause sometimes I get a look then, like they didn't like that answer as much.Do you think if I quit my current job that would increase my chances of getting hired somewhere else, since I can start right away? This seems to be what some places want, and maybe it's all the places since I have not been hired anywhere in two years.I was told by my friend that also, my references are hard to get a hold of. I guess that's what happens when you work a night job. They sleep in during the day, and get up before the evening, and go to work at night, after having an evening with friends, etc. So a lot of places probably call the references during the day, when they are all sleeping maybe. But they are the only references I got, since I've only had the one job so far. So what do you think? Should I quit my current one, so I have can start at whatever new one right away, and hopefully get hired somewhere else as a result?
