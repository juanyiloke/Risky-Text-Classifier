Perceptions of you by others and male fashion.My student days have become of late more serious. I am undertaking a PHD and there is a chance that in sept 2015 it could be funded and maybe even provide a source of income depending on how this year goes.I decided earlier this year that I would be kidding myself if I thought that my academic work alone would be all that I was being judged on.ÊThat taken into account I have made changes to myself. The first was to interact more with my supervisors and make sure I take credit for what I am doing.ÊI even changed my style to appear more professional and put together, For years I was a long haired rocker.I cut my hair and I was wondering what 'style' is appropriate? I noticed that the students who make the little efforts in these things do get noticed positively for it. They get taken more seriously.ÊDo you take your career into account for your dress sense? I mean during office /college hrs?ÊI'm still wearing the fedora outside of nine to five.ÊAnd any suggestions or tips?
