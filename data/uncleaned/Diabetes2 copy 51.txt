Research into what matters to people with diabetes  9  Hi, I’m Poppy and I’m carrying out some research on behalf of Outcomes Based Healthcare (OBH) into what outcomes matter to people living with diabetes.Please note that by contributing to this discussion you are consenting to the use of your words for research.  Your words will be anonymised, meaning we will not use your name or any personal details from this site.  Only what you write in response to this post will be used. However, as with any online related activity the risk of a breach of confidentiality is always possible. You may not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study may help us develop new methods of learning from patients and defining outcomes. Outcomes can be defined as the results that patients value when seeking treatment.  A positive outcome is a change for the better in a person’s health.  The purpose of this research study is to explore whether online forums are a good place to source outcomes that matter to patients. So, if you have read the above, have diabetes and would like to be a part of this study, please share what outcomes are important to you. What results matter to you in your health care?  What do you hope to gain from your health care?  Please feel free to respond to other peoples’ answers too.
