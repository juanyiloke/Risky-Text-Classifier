Pensions NightmaresHello everyone,Apologies for intruding, but I am a scriptwriter in search of some inspiration. I am working with a production company on a project (in very early stages) that involves a recent pensioner who discovers that her pension is not worth what she thought it was. Beyond that, nothing has been decided and I'm looking for a scenario where this could happen. The more disastrous the better. Does anyone have any experience that they could share? Please feel free to reply or private message me. Your help is very much appreciated.Many thanks,Willo
