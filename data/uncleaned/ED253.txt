ÊHow to get over an eating disorder in college?I've been dealing with OCD/restrictive eating for this whole fall semester of my sophomore year of college, and I'm trying to get my life back on track. I was wondering if there were any other college students out there who have dealt with some of the "fears" I have relating to my disordered eating and school: for example, I used to love going out and drinking, but now am afraid to go to parties because I am afraid of the calories in alcohol. I used to love ordering chai lattes and studying in our school's coffee shop, but haven't let myself had a single coffee drink or even study there because I'm too afraid of the temptation. Also, college students tend to eat a lot, and every event features snacks/cookies/something yummy and scary, so I've been avoiding a lot of events. As you can see it's been very isolating, and I really, really want to just be able to be "normal" again and enjoy college and go out and eat crap sometimes, but I'm so scared to let myself get there for fear of going "overboard" and gaining weight. Has anyone else been able to resume normal college activities after an eating disorder?? Any tips/suggestions?
