Holiday time________________________________________I recently have been offered a position in retail which I am delighted about as I have really struggled to secure part-time positions during my time as a student. I will be starting in two weeks but my issue is that I have booked a holiday for 12 days after a month into my contract.I alerted my employer to this when I was given the initial offer but this was with a head office which wouldn't have dealings with me after I start (I would assume). So what I'm wondering is, is it unreasonable to take an almost two week holiday not long after starting a contract? Is it possible that I will be let go for this as I did not mention my plans during the interview process (but I did once I got offered)?Secondly, how should I let me future managers know about this? As I said it is only a part-time (15 hours per week) contract. I don't want to lose this position but also I can't exactly do anything about my plans. All advice is appreciated!
