Maths questionMaths is definitely not my strength - if they offered a Basic Diabetes Maths course I'd have to repeat!  Here goes: I want to up my carbs slightly, but don't know how to up my doses to match. At breakfast I have insulin 4:4 CPs which is easy - 1:10g. At lunch I have insulin 4:6 CPs and at my evening meal insulin 5:4 CPs - so 1) what are my ratios? and 2) how do I do the maths?! I'm trying to start thinking UK-stylee as far as carb counting is concerned, and this would help me take the first step - I might even end up teaching my endo something (if she'd listen, of course).
