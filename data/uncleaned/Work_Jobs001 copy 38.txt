Company won't pay full holiday pay________________________________________I am working for a security company. For the last year I have worked 13 hours a day four days a week and do a fifth day when required. When time comes to take my holidays the company will only pay 37.5 hours holiday pay even though my average working week is at least 48 hours. I also have to work bank holidays as they fall on my normal day of work but the company only pay 7 hours bank holiday pay on top of my normal rate even though I work 13 hours on the day. When I addressed this issue with the company they reduced my hours until I signed a statement recognising the company's policy on holiday payments however I feel that the company not paying the full payment is illegal. Please can anyone advise on whether or not the company is acting within their rights.
