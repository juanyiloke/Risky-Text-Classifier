News of the WorldFor decades The News of the World has been known as a salacious scandal rag, my father refused to buy it back in the fifties and sixties, yet it became the biggest selling Sunday paper in the country. What does that say about the British people? If this sort of stuff was not profitable, this scandal would not have happened. Those who bought this paper on a regular basis have some responsibility for this as well as Mr Murdoch & Co.
