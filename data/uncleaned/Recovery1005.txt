More good news!Well, I finished Spring semester with all A's this time! It used to be so difficult in previous semesters to show up for class due to all the stress I was having and I wound up with tons of absences. So, teachers would either drop me or give me an F and I had to take the course over. I was only absent like twice though this time, and I got my GPA up to 3.18 with the A's, so now if I just get it up a bit higher to 3.3 I can get a $1000 scholarship from the school. I'm so glad those days when I used to do badly are over. Yay.
