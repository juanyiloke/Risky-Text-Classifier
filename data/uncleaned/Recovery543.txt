  Just will gonna one more shot (for the umpth time)So, ever since i realized my problem was due to lowself esteem  and fear of being rejected, i thought i would start with firstly making myself accept that i have a stone will power like how mom  and people always  says i have when im working on stuff i like. One of the goals i put for this summer was finishing subbing at least one anime series/season. Since there is like one month before summer ends, i subbed two episodes just today as to start. The anime i selected is 49 ep.Why i put such a hard to finish goal? Because i know that if i want to i can finish stuff that takes a few days by doing them in a row. But if i can manage to finish a goal that wants longer time, then i can't say to myself that i can't pull out a long fight to my bipolar disorder  (which i most likely have) so , would HAVE to fight. I also get pretty furious when people order me doing something so another person trying to pump  me or help  usually fruitless. They only help with giving advices or sometimes when i feel down. And i appreciate that. But it's a inner fight, any bipolar would know that.So, even if im just translating a childish series according to my "friends", i will be actually claiming myself that i actually can pull out long  journeys with my will power.I hope that doesn't sound too meaningless or stupid... But i will do it anyway.
