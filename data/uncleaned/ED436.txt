ÊDo I need help?So my boyfriend thinks I should tell them about my eating habits when I'm gonna see my therapist for the first time March, 23rd. My eating habits have changed a lot in the past few months. I've eaten way less, skipped meals, fasted and I stopped eating meat. All I can think about is my body, my weight, calories and so on. I just hate my body so much. I am just sooooo fat ugh. I was fasting for 70 hours and I was gonna do more but I couldn't. I broke my fast with a small b/p and that was the first time I managed to purge. I've tried to many times before but couldn't. Now I managed to and it just felt so good
