Blood in urine bag Hi all. I had a laperascopic prostatectomy on 30th March 2015. In hospital 2 nights.First night home woke up tachacardic in the early hours. Trip to A+E. Noticed blood in the catheter bag and a sample taken indicated there was an infection. Put on antibiotics. Second day on these and there is still blood in the bag although not as concentrated. Feeling drained and lethargic this morning which is a shame because I sat up for about 10 hours yesterday. Other than this feeling ok. No one warned me about the scrotal bruising. No pain just discomfort and paracetamol help.Anyone had a similar experience or words of wisdom
