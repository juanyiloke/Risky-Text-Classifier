 Borderline, Bipolar or What?Hi,I’m new here and I have already introduced myself in the Introductions section, but I wanted to share my story in here as well, as I feel I do belong here.I was first diagnosed with Major Depression in 2002, at 20 – at the time I also had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and later Panic Disorder. Then in 2005 I went to one of the most famous psychiatrists in Italy and he diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder because I had a hypomanic episode following treatment with an older antidepressant. Other doctors later confirmed this diagnosis, even though none of them has ever looked very convinced, but I guess they didn’t want to contradict the great professor who originally diagnosed me. Who knows. Anyway, some months ago I was told I have in fact a double diagnosis, Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I must say I feel like I fit very well in the BPD diagnosis, indeed I remember suggesting 10 years ago to various psychiatrists that I might have the disorder. Actually at the time I had all the 9 symptom listed by the DSM for the disorder. Now I have less of them.To cut a long story short, I don’t know what/who I am anymore. I know a psychiatric label/mental illness cannot define me, but I so much need to be defined – I always do, like I hadn’t any identity of my own.Anyway, I am waiting for a consultation in a renowned center in Rome, probably the most renowned for the treatment of personality disorders. They should call me soon to go and see a doctor there who will either confirm or deny my current diagnosis. We’ll see. I’m looking forward to it. I want to know what I need to do with myself.Thanks for reading my story.
