Overpayment issue - racist treating by an employer________________________________________Hello,Please read carefully, and please give me any good advices, how we can solve this problem.Friend of mine is working around 5 years as a cleaner, she was on sick leave around 1.5 year, after when she came back to work, the employer changed her schedule and also he added more job to do, he feels really discriminated, because hes very good person, reliable, honest VERY hard working. He took another irish cleaner and its clearly visible that the job is not hard as job of my friend. (less duties, less cleaning).This is the first issue, now the second:For around one year he was on ''overpayment'' however that wasn't he's fault (even the same employer admitted that is NOT HES FAULT BUT THE SALARY DEPARTMENT OFFICE).He's payslip was not like ''warning you are on overpayment'', it had just more money and he thought this is the raise for after 5 years of really really hard work. Now he have to pay off the whole debt which is 15k (ye really.) So the salary department will take away 300 euro from each his salary per month - my question is - is that really necessary and its okay for law. Like I said, (my friend) he clearly sees that all the debt money that they took away to cover the debt are going to not really necessary stuff and goods for school - for example um.....holidays...for employers.
