Constantly expect bad things to happen/rape.I'm 19 years old and for the past couple of years I have felt afraid to be out on my own, especially at night. When I am walking down a street I feel uncomfortable with my heart races and my breathing gets heavier. I find myself very suspicious of men, for example, I feel afraid to order a takeaway if I am in my flat alone (I have two female flatmates who are usually around) because I am afraid of a man delivering the food and possibly knowing I am alone. I feel very uncomfortable about my own chest and hate wearing anything revealing unless I am drunk. I constantly check behind me when walking and I feel afraid walking past vans. I have to go on a year abroad later this year for several months to another country so I'm very afraid about how I will cope with being in a strange place walking on my own with strangers all around and at night. I constantly check several times whether all of our windows and door are closed and locked.Ê
