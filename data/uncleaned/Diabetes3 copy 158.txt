Annual Review as a source of demotivation - an unstructured moanAnnual review today. HBA1c = 33. 'You're too tightly controlled. Avoid hypos at all costs'.No scope for debate about how I control or review. No scope for review of my own graphs. nHS data system view of my hba1c history the only issue coveredNo discussion of literature that reflects on being as close as possible to non diabetic levels being statistically linked to minimisation of complications.No interest in whether I understand my hypos or work to reduce the frequency. If it wasn't for concern about driving license.Waste of time for all involved.Sorry for the moan
