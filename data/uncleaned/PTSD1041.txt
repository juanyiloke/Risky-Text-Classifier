First of all, I want you to know that I feel emotionally healthy. What I‰€ªm about to talk about is more like an annoying itch that doesn‰€ªt go away.ÊI don‰€ªt know how much I talked about this before. But, I had been kicked out of my last school in 10th grade. Needless to say, enough people believe, and there‰€ªs enough hanky evidence to prove, that it wasn‰€ªt my fault. Something was going on with the school. After I left, I suffered from PTSD. Some of my symptoms were loss of appetite, loss of interest in family relationships, keeping to myself, and a number of emotional outbursts over petty things. Fiver years later, most of the symptoms (especially with the help of a girlfriend I got after the event) have tapered off to just being some dreams I get annually. However, I still catch myself having some strong feelings every now and then. For example, while doing some research, I found anÊarticleÊthat I felt strongly about:ÊWhat got me was that the lady referenced inÊthe articleÊfound herself to not have been whole for the past 25 years of her life. In particular, she dumped a friend only because her parents didn‰€ªt entirely approve of them. I got to thinking ‰€ÏHow does she feel about what she missed out on in high school? Can missing out on an experiencesÊcause youÊto feel left out or empty later on?‰€ Most other forums I read on the topic say that for anyone who opted out on things in high school (friendships, school dances, parties), they didn‰€ªt miss much. Furthermore, they have theÊoptionÊof making up for it in college or even waiting until graduation.ÊWhat do you think? Does someone lose something if they miss out on high school or get PTSD or something else? Can that loss ever be replaced?
