So after spending 30 pound on a pair of first Clarks shoes for my dd it looks like a month later she's outgrown them. I don't mind spending out but especially now the nice weather is here I'd like her to have a few different pairs, ie sandal type, smart pair for nice occasions and a normal pair , when I looked in a cheaper shop, ie shoe zone and noticed there shoes were only 7.99 I felt guilty as it just seemed too cheap, so walked out. Just wondered how much you spend?? Do you have a decent pair and then a few cheap pairs?? She's growing really fast at the moment, I can't keep up x
