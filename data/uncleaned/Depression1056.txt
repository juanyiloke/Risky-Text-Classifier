What's up.Soooo, I'm about to turn 29 and couldn't be more un happy. Typical story I have everything and more than I've ever wanted and worked for evey bit of it. I don't buy into the poor me thing and don't really care to be bothered with it. I feel that my life is a complete shade of black and everything around me is blacker. Nothing interests me and I don't really care because I just want to be left alone by everyone. I can't help but feel like a whiney silver spoon fed mummies boy because I feel that most people with these thoughts are. I have achieved everything in my life on my own without the help from anyone and like it that way. Now most professionals would say I'm lonely and un loved but wrong I have a loving wife, friends etc.lol. insecure?  Lol. Love my life and everything I do and have. I'm not suicidal because I would rather live with this than take the easy way out. Summary - every second of every day of every hour it never ends and theres nothing we can do about it.
