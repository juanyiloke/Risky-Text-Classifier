I was diagnosed with bronchitis back in early September and treated with prednisone andVentolin. This cough just wouldn't go away, and I kept thinking it was related to ragweed allergies, so I tried to wait it out. Second doctor visit (October), doctor gave me a steroid shot, something for the cough, and I kept on with the Ventolin. I would improve briefly after the steroid treatments, but it would never completely go away. Third doctor visit, he addedSymbicort to the mix, and after a couple of weeks, I thought I was finally starting to get better. Then I went downhill again, thinking maybe it was because I stopped taking Zyrtec. (Had to go off it for allergy testing.) Finally got in to see an Allergy/Asthma specialist on Tuesday, and he said I have asthma. They did a breathing test with candles on the computer screen, and I could barely blow out half of them before having a coughing fit. They gave me a breathing treatment, and when they had me do the test again, I had improved 18%. (I was able to blow out all but one of the candles.) So since Tuesday, I've been on a boatload of meds. Prednisone, antibiotic, Zyrtec,Flonase, Advair, Singulair, and albuterol/nebulizer. I do the Advair a.m. and p.m., and the nebulizer every 4 hours in between. Not sleeping well with all the side effects, and I feel like I'm improving a little bit maybe. (I managed to sleep most of the night and went 6 whole hours between inhalers last night.) When you're first diagnosed, does it take a while to get it under control? How long is a while? A week? 2 weeks? 2 months? I feel like I've been sick for so long, and I just want to feel better already! Thanks for listening, and I'd appreciate any thoughts, advice, or encouragement you have to share.
