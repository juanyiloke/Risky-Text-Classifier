how do resits work?by notcutoutforthisfirst year at uni, been absolute hell in terms of me learning, I've never had a worse time in education than this and now I've got finals coming up and I pretty much have to get 70% in every exam just to pass the year.How do resits work? I know that they cap the exam at 40% but does that mean that the final exam accounts for 100% of the year? because i just dont know what to do Ive always thought i was bright my a levels went great yet here i am struggling with what everyone says is the easiest year in uni nothing has made me so depressed I just want to cry
