Asthma triggered by ethanol vapour?________________________________________I have asthma that's partly caused by allergies, but most of the time I cope very well, even without inhaled cortisone. Recently I've noticed that I cough a lot and sometimes get short of breath when a) going to the tanning salon and b) working in the lab. In both environments, ethanol is used as a disinfectant, so I've been wondering whether anyone else's asthma is triggered by ethanol vapour? But the strange thing is that I've worked in that lab for the last three years and I've never had that kind of problem before, even at times where my asthma was flaring.
