Here I go againI am so frustrated and anxious right now! I just got released from the hospital after a week long stay due to an intentional overdose of Klonopin to try and ease my suffering.Well here I am not even a full week on Prozac 10mgs and it has my anxiety through the roof! I was already suffering from cognitive impairment such as inability to concentrate, memory issues, confused and disorganized thinking, making constant verbal errors, and other similar issues due to my anxiety. Now all of these symptoms have intensified AGAIN!ÊI was just on Zoloft for a little over 2 weeks and stopped due to the increase in my symptoms. I'm so upset right now. I don't know what to do!! Does this mean that an ssri is not the right type of medication for me?
