Marriage Referendum question on mens rightsOk so straight off I am voting yes because I believe that everyone should be able to get married regardless of gender. That and I am anti religion But serious question. This has been dogging me all week.The Referendum proposes changes to the definition of the word "family" in the constitution. Now I have no issue with 2 men or 2 women being "a family".It means that no longer does the constitution recognize the need for a man or a woman to be in a child's lifemy concern is, how does this affect unmarried men who have issues with custody?If a man and a woman no longer both need to be in a child's life then surely a judge could read this letter of the law and depending on how ruthless the mothers solicitor is, could even disregard the fathers rights altogether.Now I am in a happy relationship thank Eire and I dont think this will ever be an issue for me, but considering that mothers are given the primary rights over a child anyway. Does this Referendum further hurt mens rights?Many people will just read this and think "what are you talking about? This is just about giving gay and lesbian people the right to get married." but I dont have an issue with that. I have an issue with what else could change in law due to this rewrite. Law is not about common sense. Law is about every single letter.
