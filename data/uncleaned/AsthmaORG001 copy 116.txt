Benefits of garlic? I'm struggling with my asthma at the moment and as a noisy asthmatic (cougher) the world and his wife sees fit to give you helpful advice!!! Anyway a colleague today was telling me about her husband. Apparently he 'got' asthma as an adult and she reckoned he was pretty bad, getting put on pred quite a few times. Someone told him garlic was good so he started taking the one-a-day garlic pills and now he 'hasn't got asthma', she said he doesn't have any inhalers at all.Anyone got any ideas whether garlic works against asthma? Personally i don't think it's the magic 'cure' that she seems to think it is otherwise all doctors would be telling asthmatics just to take garlic pills.
