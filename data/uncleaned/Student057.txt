could anyone look over my dissertation?by AlioMaliI know this a a LONGGG Shot but I handed my dissertation in last week and I am so keen to know even ROUGHLY what grade I am on, My supervisor was useless- only looked at my draft 2 days before the final submission. I didn't even ask her what grade she thought it was because she made it very clear she really couldn't give a damn and that her Msc/Phd students were far more important.I just have no idea roughly what it even is, 2:2, 2:1, just no idea! It would put my mind at ease just a little bit to get a general idea but as I said I know this is a long shot so very unlikely anyone will agree to look over it for me lol
