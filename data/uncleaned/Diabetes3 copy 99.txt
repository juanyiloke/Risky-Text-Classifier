Hypo 5am and hard on myselfHi as most of you know i am recovering from major spine surgery. Have been feeling low which my family have said its normal. I am wearing a back brace when i am mobile and sleeping is difficult as its hard to turn over and i cant lay flat on my back without a pillow under my knees as my back wont let me so i have disturbed sleep. I've been given amytriptiline and diazapam. I woke feeling sweaty at 5am and i knew i was hypo but i couldn't rationalise getting out of bed, its typical next to my bed i always have a bottle of lucozade but i slept in my sons single bed as Richards snores kept me awake so no lucozade. I lay there a further 30 minutes thinking won't my liver kick in and give me glucose but of course one shouldn't rely on that. I managed to get up put brace on and slowly come downstairs and test 2.1 hair and body soaked in sweat! I ate 2 cadburys chocolate pots and a scotch pancake i knw not ideal but i was starving. Crawled back to bed and shivered for an hour and fell asleep. All day it's affected me and i realised I was hungry going to bed so ate 2 scotch pancakes and took 2.5 units for them but that was too much as low in carbs but i assumed. Naughty bad mistake.
