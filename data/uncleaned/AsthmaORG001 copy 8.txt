Changing to a cheaper inhaler Seretide to Flutiform I have recently had a letter from my GP practise advising me that they are changing my inhaler from Seretide 250 to Flutiform. It actually states on the letter that they are changing it because Flutiform is cheaper. Seretide worked really well for me in controlling my asthma and I never had to use my reliever. It also took a long time to find one that suited me. I have started on Flutiform and already my asthma has de-stabilised - quite significantly. I am seeing my GP next week about this. Does anyone know if I can demand to stay on the Seretide, as I don't want to have to go through trying lots of different inhalers when I already know that Seretide works for me? Many thanks.
