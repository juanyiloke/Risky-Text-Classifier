In This Moment...i Choose...I had a rough day yesterday...I was incredibly irritable and just wanted to be left alone. I felt discouraged because I had been making progress over the last week. It was definately a day that I just 'survived', but at the end of it I was proud of myself for that. I made it through..I gave myself permission to spend most of the day in my room, though I did manage to do a few things around the house and made meals. I distracted myself by working on my cross-stitch project. I looked forward to the evening and watching the 'Bachelor' finale. But still at the end of the day, it was like 'whew! I made it!'.I guess some days are going to be like that. But not every day will be.This journey to recovery is definately not a sprint. So many small steps will hopefully show progress. Sometimes it will feel like I am making great strides, and other times I will take steps backwards..sometimes, I might just be standing still.I wish I could be 'there' now, you know- that happy place where life feels so easy and the depression is far behind me. But I know it will take time.SO, I HAVE DECIDED..that what I CAN control is 'this moment', and in this moment I CHOOSE the following:- to breathe, to feel the air going in and out of my lungs.- to get out of bed everyday- to take my medication as prescribed and follow all of my doctors orders.- to set a few small attainable goals each day- to not panic when I feel 'low', to acknowledge it, accept it and not let it spiral.- to look for the positive. The positive yesterday was that I made it through. The positive for today is that I am choosing to be mindful of the present. Today is a better day so far. I am hoping that by making these small changes and choices, they will add up. That doing these things will be like conditioning a muscle, exercising it to make it stronger.
