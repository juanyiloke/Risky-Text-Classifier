  How is everybody on here doing?I haven't posted in a while. Mainly cause my mood has actually been ten times better. The statistics class that was causing me trouble that I was telling people about on here...well, I passed it. So now I've been more inclined to finish up the rest of my classes cause they're relatively easy in comparison. Now, all I got to do is find an internship for the fall and that's it for my requirements. And then I'll be graduating in the fall. I signed up for three co-ed physical education classes too. One weight training class, one personal fitness class, and one total body fusion class...just as an effort to get back in shape along with my once a week yoga class and I'm thinking about joining a gym too (for night might be overkill though).I can't say I'm really as depressed as I was a week ago...but boy am I bored! I haven't gone out as much as I used to...especially compared to years past. Going out to the bars in this city doesn't appeal to me anymore. I'm more about going to concerts but I never have anyone to go with anymore. So, i pretty much stay at home and work on music. I'm working on two albums which I'm trying to have done by the end of this month which have been getting a good amount of anticipation by people on various internet sites. Also working on some tracks for this group I came across on a forum.So, how's everyone doing out there?
