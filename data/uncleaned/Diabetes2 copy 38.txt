Advice please  7  I have a doctors app for tomorrow.  I'm very nervous. I'm 31 and would say in good health, however over the past year my hair is thinning, I've had a rash on my lower legs that won't go away and itchs like mad.  The past month I wake up with my arm numb in the same place and feel my fingers want to turn in. My thigh also has a dull numbness. I dipped my urine In work the other day and the glocouse reading was off the scale.  My father was diabetic, though passed away at the age of 39.  Any thoughts and advice would be much appreciated.
