MiscarriageI have miscarried multiple times. Always early on. Probably more times than we're aware of, considering times when we weren't using protection.We also have had healthy pregnancies, resulting in amazing fascinating little people.I don't mourn my miscarriages. (The most recent - yesterday.) It was something that might have been - but that wasn't. I'm not upset. It would have been nice - but obviously the baby was unwell in some way, and I'm glad that the pregnancy ended early and no pain was caused.Equally I absolutely understand and empathise with people who mourn their miscarriages as a loss. It's strange. I can see why it could be so awful. But I don't find it so, and I don't see anything wrong with this? It was just something that never happened - for me.As one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, I'd love to hear others' experiences.
