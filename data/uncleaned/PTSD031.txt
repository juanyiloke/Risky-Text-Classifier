Self Pity, Attention Seeking And Not TryingHello.I am a former member here and sometimes I still like to come here and read posts.I have noticed there are still some active members from when I was here and they haven't really made much progress.I notice they are still stuck in self pity,seeking attention and not trying.This place is a very good starting point but there comes a time when you need to take what you have learned and apply it in real life.Misery loves company and continuing to come here year after year,whining and complaining,isn't helping yourself,it is just prolonging it.I probably sound mean,but I worked my ass off here during ny active membership,my goal was to become functioning by learning all that I could.It just makes me sad to see those same people here,hanging on,afraid to let go and move on in life.
