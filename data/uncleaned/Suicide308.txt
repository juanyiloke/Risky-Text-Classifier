What if...Hey friends....First of all, sorry for all the spelling mistakes I might make... I'm from Denmark, but I'll try my best in english...Well, I think many of you maybe have thought about the queston "what if I just was gone?" and "What would happen then?"... I do... year, I have thought about it a lot, for a while now... "who will cry? and who will care? Who will honestly miss you".... I have to say, that I'm not an unpopular girl, actually I have pretty many "friends".. or so the rest of the world think... the fact is, that I only think I have 1 real friend... He's name is Jakob... I think he might be the only one, who really gonna miss me, besides my family... Have you guys ever read or seen the story about Hazel Grace, "The Fault in Our Stars"? There is a guy, in the book, who says something like: everybody will be forgotten at some time, and someday you'll be not on any mind anymore... you'll just end up like nothing....And I think the author, John Green, is right.... at the end I maybe don't matter to anyone... Not even my family... they'll get over it at a time... I am crying myself into sleep, but still smiling to the world, maybe even more than all they other people, just to be sure, that they wont see through me.... I really don't think anyone will miss me that much... the few ones, who will miss me, like my family and Jakob, have a lot of other "friends".... year, I think they will cry, but they'll also get over it...Sorry for this depressing post, but I just have to come out with it somewhere.... it's late now... over midnight, but I'm not tired... but I have to make myself fall in sleep now, so I can wake up tomorrow, and make sure everything seems normal....
