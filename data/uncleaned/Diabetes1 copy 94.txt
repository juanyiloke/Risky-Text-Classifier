a sore throat, will it put BG upI am type 2 , brought on by prednisolone 15 to 20 years ago. I am on tablets and insulin. (Novomix) I have been put back on prednisolone 4 weeks ago and I am concerned about my glucose levels. I am trying really hard to eat low carbs and I am spending most of my time with a rumbling tum. I thought that this would have worn off by now. I have a sore throat a the moment and my bloods are in double figures even hours (5 hours) after a low carb meal. Is this due to Prednisolone or the sore throat or both. What do you think. Thanks
