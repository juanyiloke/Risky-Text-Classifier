Hello!My post maybe a long one so I apologise in advance. My LG is 6 weeks today. For the first 3 weeks of her life she was "text book" slept all day and all night. Woke in the night for a feed and went straight back to sleep. She would happily sit in her bouncer or lay on her playmat no problem. This would leave me free to do house work and shower.Now the last 3 weeks since daddy has been back at work has been absolutely horrendous. She won't sleep in the day and won't be content so unless I'm picking her up then she is crying. I can't even shower.Night times she sleep 2/3/4 hours depending on when she wakes. This is because she will for love nor money, not go back down to sleep.She is colicky and suffering from reflux.ÊI'm in bits everytime my husband gets home and can't stop crying. I can survive in 2/3/4 hours sleep every 24 hours so I don't know how age is doing it.ÊThing is my husband thinks I'm exaggerating because when he's at home during the weekend, yes she cries a lot in the day and won't just "be" but she sleeps! He does the night shift and always ends up with a good 6 or 7 hours sleep albeit broken.I'm at my wits end and can't keep going through this cycle. In so run down I'm getting every cold add illness and look a mess. I just want our content baby back!I think I've tried most thing. I look forward to any replies!
