Atchoo!Thanks to this fantastic forum I'm really enjoying a stonking cold. I don't mean I caught it off anyone here from germs seeping up through the keyboard. But the newfound energy I have these days as a result of changing my diet and also mixing with a bunch of merry travellers (that's you) conspire to carry me through the sneezes, coughs, aches, and general feeling that I'm about 20 feet underwater. Luckily I'm able to feed the cold and am eating heartily and have the stamina to exercise adequately. The only bad time is in the wee small hours after lying down when I feel as if I've been in the front row of a Hawkwind concert for seven hours.Or maybe eight.Before man-flu was invented I used to feel that a cold was the nearest thing to death other than, well, death, so the change is amazing. Thank you all again and may all your sneezes be kitten-sized.
