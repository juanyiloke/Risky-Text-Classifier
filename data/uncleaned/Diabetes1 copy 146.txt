Special Diabetic Clinics rather than GP surgeriesHaving read many blogs about the various differences in the help offered by GP surgeries I wonder if there is any mileage in specialist clinics where the staff would be up to date with all current thinking on how to deal with diabetes. If you have a foot problem you go to the podiatrist, a tooth problem to the dentist so why not a diabetic clinic. Like many of your readers I find my GP nurse and doctor offer no actual advice on lifestyle changes and just push pills. I have tried statins and suffered muscle problems so no longer take them, similary I tried Metformin but could not handle the sickness and depression. I now do not take anything for my Type 2 diabetes. My BMI is 22 and I go to the gym 4 times a week and eat healthily, recently started on lo-carb at the suggestion of one of your readers. My fasting BS is now 5.4 and is within 2 of this 2 hours after eating a meal. I know next time I see either the nurse or the GP they are going to try and push me onto pills again, the result is I try not to go to the surgery.Having this forum is a god send, I find all my questions answered here and would prefer not to have to go to the surgery at all, unfortunately that is not an option.I have spoken to friends who have other health issues and they all same the same, the GP is writting out a scrip before you even sit down, no wonder the NHS is running out of money.
