I wonder what needs to happen before I can find my path and start having better days without talking down to myself.Today I went to play a few frames of snooker with my brother (I am proud I had a break of 21 last week). And somehow I feel we are drifting apart. He is very selfish and has a very hurtful sense of humor. But still I do not say anything because I do not want there to be anger around us. But I do need to stand up for myself because I can feel this is getting the better of me. And I am like this in so many situations. I cant stand myself for being such a push over. I know that there are many times I can not seem to handle posting in this section, but I do value all your opinions so I need to keep trying.Thanks all for being so patient with me. I know so well what is "wrong" with me but changing things that have been in place so long is almost impossible to change.When I am feeling a bit better and want to change i listen to this clip. Its a motivation for a baseball team in the USA, but some parts are so spot on for my troubles. The part that is a perfect fit is from 1.26 minutes. Change the sport parts to depression and it gives me goosebumps.
