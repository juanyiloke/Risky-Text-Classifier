The Depression Cure By Stephen S. Ilardi- Has Anyone Read It?Hello everyone! I'm new to the forum and this is my first post :-)I have just spent the whole day marathon reading this book, which I just impulsively bought after watching a lecture by this Dr. at the university of Michigan (I believe it was) on YouTube. I'm now very eager to put into practice the advice and techniques this author recommends. I have read so many self help books, but although they all seem so clear when you read them, it's sometimes difficult to put everything into practice later on... This one is very practical, it talks about 6 action point such as exercise, diet, social involvement, sunlight exposure etc.I would really love to hear if anyone has tried out these techniques, that Ilardi calls TLC (therapeutic lifestyle change).Warm greetings fromAutumnleaves25
