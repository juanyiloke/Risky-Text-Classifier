Marriage to a psychopath caused severe C-PTSDby mcmjuly » Sat Jul 12, 2014 12:40 amAfter a childhood filled with severe neglect and abuse, I married a psychopath who systematically dismantled my life, left for another woman, and never looked back at how much he had hurt me. I'm not the same person now. I lost my desire to form relationships with the opposite sex and don't believe I will ever get it back. It's been 7 years since my marriage ended, and my spirit is injured in a way only the other unfortunate souls who have traveled this road can relate to. If anyone out there is suspecting they may be dating or married to a psychopath, I suggest you really look into it, because the aftermath of being with a psychopath is something no one wants to experience. Your life will change in extreme ways and you will not like any of them.
