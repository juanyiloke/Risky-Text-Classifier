Hi! New Here________________________________________Hi! New Here....I am 44 years old with an adult child on the severe end of the autism spectrum. When my son was younger he had mild asthmatic symptoms but never nothing serious. In fact, as he's gotten older it appears he has grown out of his asthmatic symptoms or they have when into remission.Last summer I started getting sick. I worked in a textile factory around hosiery. I handled a lot of hosiery that was in a department with a lot of moisture due to ceiling and pipe leaks, therefore mold was abundant. The area I worked in was also very humid and no air conditioning. I expressed to my employer that I thought the department they had moved me too a few months prior was making me sick. Of course, I was ignored. As time went on I developed severe vertigo. So bad I was out of work for nearly 2 weeks. I was put on Meclizine, and medication for nausea basically just treating the symptoms. Around this time I had also developed a cough, dry in nature for the most part. A hacking, annoying, cough. This on off and on for several months. Putting things together I had started suspecting I had developed mold allergies. I was given Pro Air because I had started wheezing frequently and noticing difficulty breathing in hot, thick, humid air. I asked my Doctor twice am I developing Asthma? Both times they were hesitant to give me a diagnosis yet I continued to suffer and progressively got worse. I went round and round with my employer and finally had to get ugly to get them to move me from the department I was in. Even after the move I would go in and work at the most 2-4 hours and be extremely sick, wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. I had noticed I also had a short temper, seemed at times disoriented and lack of patience. To make a long story a little shorter I had to take a layoff from my job due the the fact that I could not work in the building at all for it making me sick. I went back to my doctor and told him I suspected mold allergies and why. He sent me to an Allergy/Asthma Specialist and he was concerned I had mold in my sinuses and lungs because of the severity of my symptoms. He did scratch and blood test and concluded the only thing I am allergic too is molds. He ordered scans of my sinuses and lungs and they came back negative for mold growth. That is a GOOD thing! He started me on Dulera, Dymista, I was already on Zyrtec every day and he started me on Singulair and two antacid medications for reflux. After a couple months I was doing no better. Dizzy, wheezing having to use my Pro Air daily most of the time more than once, I was a mess. Then he got me approved for Xolair injections. I take two Xolair injections once a month. Oh, yeah all that time I was working and sick before Xolair I was on Predisone. Gained 60lbs, felt horrible.. that stuff is NASTY!!!So now... Xolair is helping but I still can't tolerate much time outside like at the most 10 min's a day in hot humid weather. Mold counts are high during that time and since I live in the mid Atlantic humidity is rampant. Basically, I live inside from April till December. I just can't tolerate the mold and humidity and pollution. It is quite depressing. Sometimes I go out at night, but even then the next day I will be sneezing, coughing and sinus headaches... To me it's just not worth it. People do not understand. I can't work like this. I go see my son every other week who lives in a group home an hour from us and I am sick for two or three days just from walking in and out of the house and the group home.Anyone else here taking Xolair injections? I've taken about 6 so far. I can tell a difference, but not as much as I was hoping for. Anyone else here have mold allergies?Sorry this was so long but I wanted to give a good idea of my Asthma background. Any questions or suggestions are welcomed. It is nice to find this message board because sometimes I feel very alone dealing with this. It has really disrupted my life.seaofhope1508
