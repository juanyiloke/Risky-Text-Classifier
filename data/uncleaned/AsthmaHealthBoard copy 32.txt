Nebulizer/atomizer suggestion________________________________________Hi all. First time poster here.I have asthma, but it's not terrible. I use my current small hand held one, the ex breathe atomizer, like every other day. Sometimes every 3 days.This ez breathe atomizer is not great as it gets clogged very easily by the medicine provided. However, it helps me 100%.I normally hit my atomizer the moment i feel any sort of tightness in my chest and only take a 2-3 second inhale of the medicine, then I'm good and no longer need it for a day or two or 3.With all that said, I'm looking to get a GOOD atomizer/nebulizer.Does anyone have a suggestion for one for my random asthma use?Also, one that I could buy "over the counter" medication for one is also appreciated as I don't have health insurance.Thank you in advance!!-Shane
