Weight (17 female) im 5ft4 and weigh 56kg. Im aware that according to the BMI scale that im 'normal' weight but i couldn't be unhappier. I started off as 60kg in january and from here starting eating only healthy foods and exercising quiet frequently and i didnt loose any weight.All of a sudden people started commenting on my weight loss and then people started noticing i had been eating less. because of this i felt like i should continue to eat less and had been counting every calorie and been obsessed with my weight and terrified of weight gain.Lately, i have been doing very little exericise. When i do do exercise its something small to try and make myself feel better for an extra slice of toast or something. Somedays i restrict me calorie intake so much (500) thinking im back on track but the next day i completely binge eat. It could be anything up to 3500 calories where the majority is fatty foods. I feel so sick but i continue to eat, i then start sweating, over heating, get headaches and feel generally ill. this doesnt stop me though, i will keep eating. I try to make myself sick to feel better but i cant, it doesnt work. Some days i look in the mirror and am kind of happy, a few hours later i look in it again and just cry in disgust. It's stressing me out!!I dont know if i have a disorder or if im just a regular teenage girl obsessed with their apperance. Please help me
