Took the side off DD2 ( aged 2 yrs 5 mths ) cot yesterday as she finally climbed out. It is now a cot bed with a low bed guard so she can climb out. There is a stair gate over the door. She went to bed fine last night (didn't climb out at all) but she got up at 440 this morning . I kept putting her back and telling her it was still night time. I did this 4 or 5 times and she went quiet until 530 when she started getting up again. Tried a few times to put her back but she was having none of it.Until about 2 wks ago she slept really well. Never gets up in the night and had an afternoon nap. She's dropped the nap in the last couple of weeks. Can't cope with so little sleep ( I suffered with PND after DD1 and I'm conscious of how lack of sleep could affect me) and I know she'll be beyond tired by this afternoon. Anyone advice? Thanks
