Hello i'm a veteran with severe ptsd. I've completed a six week ptsd course thru the va. Here is some tid bits of some of the things that have helped me. Ptsd is common with veterans who have seen or experienced a severely traumatic event. Most people experience syptoms of ptsd after experiencing something truamatic. The difference is most peoples symtoms fade with time. Ptsd can be addressed and syptoms lessened over time is the person understands the syptoms,and works on dealing with each syptom as a puzzle. The first thing i would like to address is anger.Imagine two circles overlapped with a space in the middle. On the Far left side is your rational mind. In the center is your wise mind and the rightside is your emotional mind. With ptsd most individuals dont use their wise mind. Why you may ask? This is because most people with ptsd skip from thier rational mind to the other extreme of emotional mind. Example: you should have paid all the bills at one time!(rational)i'm flipping pissed (emotioal) because most people understand how to pay bills. The wise mind answer is i understand you paid most of the bills could you explain why we waited to pay these bills later(and make a valid assesment of your emotions after the explaination. Most people with ptsd automaticaly make rash jumps from rational to emotional without understanding the way to properly function!
