Êscared of old way of livingHi. I have been on disability and haven't worked for 6 yrs now. I start school to train for a part time career 2 days from now. I used to react with anger,(big time) resentments or depression when I came up against adversity in work and life. I am scared I will repeat negative behavior when I go back to work. Does anybody have any suggestions for what to do?__________________Hi. I've been told I have BPD and it could be due to car accident with bad head injury I had in 1980. I have been having bad spirals mood wise for years and have been ridiculed and criticized for it. Now to kind of hear that I probably haven't used the correct type therapy for what until now has been catagorized as severe depression is a hard blow because I so want to be over this problem it's not real. I am scared but also hopeful that finally I might be able to make somne headway with my stuff.
