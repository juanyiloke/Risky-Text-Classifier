Camp America..while black?by OmaHi guys, I've applied to go to be a camp leader in America this year and got a place which is really fab.Now that its become a reality, I'm excited and can't wait but as I'm thinking more and more about it, I am also concerned for my safety. This is because of the race related events happening in parts of America, Americas reputation in general for racism and general gun culture, especially considering that I'm a British, black female with typical experience/knowledge of American culture, and I'll be, to an extent on my own completely in the hands of this organisation in another country. Making matters more interesting, I've actually been placed in a camp which is apparently in the third most racist state in America (according to some online non-offical polls/forums). Tbh the camp looks amaze but the concern is still there.Forgive if you think i'm being overly dramatic but these are my thoughts. so feel free to reassure me otherwise as that's basically why im here.So my questions for all are -Basically, what do yous think?Are there any other black people on here who have done or are thinking or doing similar ventures like summer camps abroad - What was your experience and what were/are your thoughts prior to going?For the majority who are not black, what are your thoughts on the matter in general? Do you think i'll be fine? Being overly cautious? Perhaps you know of black people who have done such things and know their experiences, please let me know?  Much appreciated Thanks.
