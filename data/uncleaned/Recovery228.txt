  free at last________________________________________I am new to the forum. I have read post a few times and find it helpful. I want to share my story with you. I am 55 years old. I have been depressed since at least age 5. I have not had a day without depression for 55 years. I have tried about every antidepressant there is. I finally broke down and went to a psychiatrist. he continued my wellbutrin and clonazapam. He added buspar and I got alitle better and was cautiously optimistic. Later remeron was added for sleep. no change in depression but I could sleep at least 6 hours , which is great. Last week I started lamictal and within days could feel things changed. I know longer have thoughts of death multiple times per day. I dont have to fight back the tears and I have energy. The world seems different and vibrant. I can't tell you how different I feel. I am not hypomanic but now actually normal. Please dont give up, seek help it can change your life
