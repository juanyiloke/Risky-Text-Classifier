ÊCan someone PLEASE give me some hope and insight?I can't take this anymore. I am 22 years old and I only realized I have BPD when I found the love of my life and lost him because of it. I was put on anti-depressants all throughout high school and it ****ing ruined my chances of getting help because they stopped me from feeling my deep-down emptiness because they just made me manic. I didn't realize until last year that I have hardly ever, ever, ever had anything that felt like ME. I have never really had hobbies that I did on my own. I always waited for the other kids to be done so they could play with me and kill the emptiness. or I would watch TV all day. I know I have so much potential inside of me and it kills me that I have caught so many glimpses of it but it always gets ripped away. the love of my life brought out so much good in me. he awakened my mind and my humor and my drive to live and it is better than anything I have ever experienced. it actually felt like living. now I am tossed back into this and I just don't know if I can do it. it's like the light is gone from my life. I have no desire to seek out an education or a career for myself. I don't want to do anything. I just want to die. I am in therapy but it takes too long and I wish I had realized all this stuff before I became a 22 year old with no accomplishments besides sporadic college enrollment. I want to end it all because I have no hope! I am so pissed and feel so alone because everything online makes BPD out to be a life sentence! where is the hope! I am sick of hearing about how to control my outbursts. I know how to do that. I want to know what to do about the EMPTINESS.
