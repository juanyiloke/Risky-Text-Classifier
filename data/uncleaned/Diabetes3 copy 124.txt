Prescription ups and downsI went to collect my prescription yesterday afternoon and the staff said 'sorry, we're closed' and wouldn't give it to me! Apparently, one afternoon every 2 months is a TARGET day, something to do with staff training - would have been nice to have been informed! I did find details on their website eventually, but I had to go digging for it.Anyway, I went in today and got it. As on every previous occasion they had prescribed ketone strips instead of glucose strips for my Optium (spare) meter, which means I'll have to go back tomorrow. Also, I asked for a new novopen echo as mine is getting a bit old and the battery has gone. I asked for a red one for a change, and I have just noticed that they have prescribed a blue one   Not a problem really, I just wish they'd read the requests properly! At least there was no fss prescribing the pen, as I thought there might be.Whilst I was searching their website I noticed that they are now offering online appointments, so I have registered for that, which is good and a lot better than trying to phone in
