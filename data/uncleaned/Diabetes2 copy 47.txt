Diagnosed as type 2 in 2011 and put on Metformin, now told by new GP I'm not diabetic  7  In 2011 I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic and immediately put on Metformin. Got sent on a Desmond day and took my wife along with me to that. Gradually lost 2 and a half stone in weight and generally took care of my eating. More or less stopped drinking alcohol as well. Had my annual diabetes checks and was told I was controlling it very well.Moved house last December and registered with a new GP. As part of the registration process I gave my medical history and was given a date for a blood test to see what my HbA1c was like in readiness to see the diabetic nurse for a review. Had the blood test and made appointment to see diabetic nurse. When I saw the diabetic nurse she told me I was not a diabetic as my blood results were that of a normal non-diabetic person. She was unable to comment further because my medical notes from my last GP had not been forwarded to the new practice. I was told to get another blood test in 4 months time, but in the mean time to half my Metformin dose. This I did and went for the results last Friday. GP told me I’m not diabetic and to stop taking Metformin altogether.Now I’m confused. Was I misdiagnosed in 2011? My original GP who made the diagnosis told me it’s a condition for life and I must learn to live with it.Has anyone else had a similar experience?
