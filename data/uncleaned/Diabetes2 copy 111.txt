Gliclazide Bad tempers   My father has just been put back on these tablets and they make he really, really bad tempered and unreasonable. One moment he can be laughing and joking and the next is like world war threes happened. He cannot see that it is the tablets making him like this, but when he is put on other tablets he is fine. The trouble is he is awaiting a cataract operation and the doctor has said he needs to stay on these tablets if he wants the operation. Has any one else had these side effects?
