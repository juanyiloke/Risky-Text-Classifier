Bullying within my team.________________________________________The issue is that one of the women on the team has started picking on another team member. Nothing blatant, loads of small digs, rolled eyes etc. I knew things had become frosty between them recently, they were never friends, but on a recent night out the other party just broke down when we were alone. Since then I've kept a closer eye on things and it is constant but very hard to pin down, if that makes sense.This is bullying and I hate it, I'm very disappointed in the person who is doing this, I've never seen this side to them in all the years we've worked together.I'm not sure how to handle this, it's not my fight but I feel like I need to do something. We don't have a direct manager at the moment, which complicates the situation further.
