I need to support someone else's recovery...Hello, folks.I am 30 and have been struggling with anorexia since around age 17-18 (first diagnosed at age 11, but I seemed to recover until I moved out for college). During my mid-20s, I began to suffer severe health anxiety due to reflections on my behavior---which, in turn, led to binging out of fear...which led to compensatory behaviors and so forth. My current diagnosis is EDNOS.I finally sought treatment this past summer, when my binges (and subsequent guilt, body dissatisfaction, and compensatory behaviors) became especially problematic in the face of the death of my mother and my first major break-up.I have had good days and bad days---but, overall, I am disappointed in the lack of progress in my recovery, and I feel that I am struggling to grasp for motivational reasons, and I fear that I am on the verge of relapse. I often think that recovery would be so much easier if I had dependents or life ambitions or other things for which I needed to safeguard my physical and mental health...but I feel that I don't, not really. Not for the past 12 years or so......except for this one thing: I want to help others not to have their lives wrecked by eating disorders.I think that I could recover in order to set a good example to others---or, perhaps, even just one other individual who is struggling to recover from a similar ailment. If my recovery meant support and encouragement to someone else, I think that I could do it...And that's why I'm here. To network. Meet people. Join a structure of mutual support.I have particular personal interest in connecting with other individuals who continue to struggle with eating disorders at such an "old" age. If you can relate, shoot me a line.Best wishes to all!
