 lost and tired.I'll make this easy and to the point. I've struggled all my life, literally. 18 surgeries. Couldn't do anything I wanted because of it. As an adult, i seem to keep finding the most selfish girlsalive. I've lost mydaughter to my first marriage. My girlfriend now has dumped me 3 times, yesterday in fact. And she always says I didn't do anything wrong. The problem on my end is how much I'm in love with her. She says she loves me but keeps doing this to me. I've never had feelings like the ones I have for her. So it's impossible to just let it go. Oh and I recently got fired, and the reason? It didn't fit the budget. So I've come to one conclusion. I am nothing more than expendable. I mean nothing and i have no importance to anyone. Do you know what it feels like to be completely and totally unwanted? Useless? Pathetic? I have no one in life to talk to, and when I've tried no one understands. So I ask here, what in the world is the point anymore. And no god is not the answer. I go to sleep every night crying and wake up and soon after I'm crying again. I can't do this anymore. The pain is too much and is intolerable. I'm seeing no reason to continue trying. The harder I try, the more I get pushed away.
