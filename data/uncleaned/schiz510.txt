ÊA councillor from local government emailed me :/A councilor I did some work for last year emailed me out of the blue today, he asked for my mobile at the voting station months ago. I view web development like my photography, always to stay impartial etc.I couldn't give a damn about his politics or his political views, I'd do some work for the raving lesbian, nazi,communist, mars lander party, if it payed well enoughBut the man not only didn't cover my costs, but couldn't even bring himself to thank me for hours of work I did last time. I'm prepared to give 110% for people that appreciate it, and I suppose if I was the manipulative narcissistic type, I'd seek to exploit the relationship for my own gain, but I'm an easy going easy livin type guy, and the chances of me entertaining the idea of working for the man again is basically.....zero
