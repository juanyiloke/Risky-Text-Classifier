what is happening?by alisiar » Sun Jul 13, 2014 9:39 pmI have recently been part of a conversation but the way the person spoke to me was odd for me, at the beginning I was feeling normal, but then the other person was talking to me and things she was saying just seemed to cause such huge physical and mental reactions in me, I felt physically sick and shaken, absolute horror, terrified. Everytime I think about this person all I keep experiencing is the abuse I suffered aged 4, I have had EMDR, I thought this was done with. I also may have DID though its hard to tell, ironically we cant agree. The person I had the conversation with is my new boss and I am going to have to talk to her at some point cause that's what people do, I feel irrational and consumed and overwhelmed by all this old stuff I am experiencing. I want to do things differently and stop feeling like such a victim but how can I do that? I wondered if talking to her and explaining what was happening for me might help me but I feel so irrational and all over the place right now I don't trust myself, and I feel so scared. what on earth is going on with me, I am an adult now why cant I just get on with it.
