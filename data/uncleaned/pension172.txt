Social Security Took Bank BooksHi there, sorry if this is the wrong place for posting this but im at my wits end, my mom phoned me today and said that social security had come in and took my dads bank books and statements I cant get to her until tomorrow is there any reason for them to be taking the books like this or have they been robbed?
