When Will Women Be Finally Sexually Liberated?I think it's great work what Miley Cyrus, Britany Spears and Christina Aguilera have done over the years. No, not their crap music. I'm speaking about how they express themselves sexually and I feel a lot of women can benefit from more of it.I can't understand why women feel the need to put up the "anti-slut" shield when a man approaches them as to not look like a total b!tch to their mates. Somehow we have to erase this attitude from society altogether. When will women brag about the men they've shagged just as men do? When will women walk up to a guy in a nightclub, or on the street, or wherever and not be afraid of the judgement they'll receive?In fact, attitudes regarding women in society have actually gone backwards. Back in the 1300's women were extremely promiscuous more so than men. It seems things have gone right the other way in our modern world. It's a sad state.
