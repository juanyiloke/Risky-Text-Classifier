Strugglinghi all it's been six weeks since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and today has been a real struggle for me,all I have wanted all day is ice cream and chocolate   I think it's all beginning to sink in a bit now as normally when I change my diet to lose weight I cave in after a few weeks and eat everything lol but I'm realising I haven't got that choice now this diet change is for life wether I like it or not,I was just wondering if it's gets easier along the way
