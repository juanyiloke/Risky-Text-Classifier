Faulty test strips.. A Cautionary Tale.. You could lose your Drivers License ??Well Hows that you may ask ?Basically I received a batch of 50 test strips and as usual kept them in their box.Sometimes at night JUST before my insulin doses I check my status as I am mostly high in the 9-10range.However after a few error readings I realized the test strips were cut incorrectly and no blood was being drawninto the test yellow part.After a few annoying fails I decided to empty the box out and sort the visual faulty ones from the rest.Easy ? no problem ???? except I located these on the work surface next to my bed,After several weirdly high readings (and subsequent double checks) I was forced to increase my Levimir/novorapid intakeBy a small amount.The following evening I repeated the increase and felt unusual.I was so concerned I did not let my self sleepmainly due to the symptems of a hypo.YOUR WORSTE NIGHTMARE??? This was really weird for me as I was normally quite high and have been for years. Too high and I obviously get mega tired quickly.I booked myself in for a Doctors visit and HBA1c test which surprisingly was the same as previous.About 9.This did not square well with the mega high readings for a month.It turns out that locating the strips on the table had contaminated them and I was getting false high readings and adjustedthe insulin levels accordingly.Result ....One hypo event.Yep the net result is the Doctor seems to have reported that I can not tell when I am going hypo or has reported 2 hypos in a year ? No she did not tell me in advance but neither did I tell her of the findings by a very efficient medical supplier. Since then ,I have received new meters and test strips and advice to triple check a bad result. Apparently this faulty test strip senario is very rare but making the mistake of contaminating the stripson a waxed or dusty table is not...I NOW HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APPEALS PROCEDURE TO TRY TO GET MY LICENSE BACK.
