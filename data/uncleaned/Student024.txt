Joining the Marine corps or the Navy for 3 yearsby yws0212Since I have committed the Adam's sin of being a South Korean male, I have to serve in the military for at least 2 years.I concluded that if I am to be doing this, I'd better make the best out of it, thus I will be joining as an officer which will enforce me to do 3 years long service. - There is a system called the Officer Candidate School.I am considering either the navy or the marine corps, so it will be one between those 2.The marines, I will be engaging with field military work as I will apply to the reconnaissance battalion as soon as I get a chance.However the navy, I am planning on joining as an interpretation officer, thus it will be more of intellectually engaging works ... mostly with Muricans. Also you get a chance to go to Somalia.I go to the LSE, and hoping to continue pursue my postgraduate study probably at the LSE or Oxford.Hmmm, given that things work out in the fashion I have planned, am I running as a good candidate in the British employment market so I can stay here?
