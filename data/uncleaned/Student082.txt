Dropping out of Final Yearby louisemcf1Hi guys,So 2015 has been quite literally the worst year of my life. After starting off with excellent grades in the first semester of my final year, I was on course to getting my wanted first class degree. Since then I failed one of my January exams, this devastated me. I then had knee surgery. After picking myself up from this, I recently got another bad grade and will unlikely get my 2:1 degree. As well as this, I have had crappy things happening with my home life and all I seem to do is cry. I am trying to complete my dissertation which is due in two weeks but now I feel like what is the point?!I feel like dropping out right now, can someone help me?!
