 Those who lived/lives at home for uni (Pgs: 1 2 3)by r-tI am planning to live at home when I start university this year. I would like to know from past or current students who lived at home, how long you had to travel to university? Did you have to travel everyday? (I know this differs depending on the uni). Do you have any regrets about living at home? Was it so tiring commuting that you just missed half of your lectures? Did you find that you missed out on making friends and having the typical uni social life? Did you find it difficult doing assignments of group presentations etc due to how far you lived from class mates? You don't need to answer all of these questions but please do if you can. Any responses are greatly appreciated. Thanks.
