Question¥	Hi all, hope all is well with you all, and if you are still going through treatment best of wishes and luck, but I have a question, and I know that turmeric is a good cancer busting herb, so when I was at my last reflexology session she asked if I had tried it, and I said I had it in food, but she said that she takes turmeric capsules and they are totally vegetarian and no chemicals, from a place called SEventh Wave, and I am wondering if anyone knows if they will be ok to take with LEtrozole.......cheers love Sally
