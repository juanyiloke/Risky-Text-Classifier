ÊPossible triggers: ramblings about PTSD and CMH treatment on NHSI need to vent. Possible triggers ********About 2yrs ago I had a total breakdown which though therapy led to me admitting I was sexually and emotionally abused as a child. Been unable to work properly or even function like I used to. Isolated myself, had my house repossessed, living on benefits and really struggling. Been through a recent crisis after my abuser (not disclosed to family and he's still part of family) f**ked with my head and triggered a lot of feelings of shame, disgust and powerlessness.ÊI've been treated by crisis team, and the psychologist. Who won't do any trauma therapy with me as it's short term and he can't finish it. So we've spent 3 months skirting around the edges. I've asked for help&support coping with flashbacks and effects etc but I'm always told "you have to be in a good place to deal with trauma". It's already ruining my life, keeping me isolated, intruding at inconvenient times and generally f**king me up. It's here. It's been a struggle for months. And I want to face it. Deal with it and put it behind me. I'm not an idiot and after keeping it quiet for 20+ years don't I deserve the chance to tell my story?? I can't tackle my family until I'm stronger and at the moment I'm a hostage to the whims of my PTSD.ÊThe NHS treatment available for CSA survivors is woefully inadequate. And in my situation, it feels like they're no better than the world of secrecy my family and my abuser kept me in for all these years. I'm trapped within a prison of my mind, looking for the slightest hope that there will be a release and seeing only shut doors.
