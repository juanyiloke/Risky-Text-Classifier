Holiday/Travelling NervesThis will be my third attempt at going away on Holiday and facing the dreaded Motorway. I am collecting ideas to get through this.I have already got:- Radio on, sunglasses at the ready, lavender in the glove compartment, bottle of water for dry throat.P.s. I am not driving, just a passenger on a three hour journey!Very, very nervous, so nervous that I want to call A & E now to warn them of a casualty. This is like jumping without a parachute for me.Ê
