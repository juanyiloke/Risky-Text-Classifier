Arm pain, numbness, pins & needles, only at night.......?¥	Hi everyone, hope you are all OK x¥	I have recently finished all my treatment (WLE, SNB, 6 x FEC, 20 x Rads).  For the past few weeks I've been experiencing numbness & pins & needles in my right arm (Not my surgery side but the arm that had Picc line in) only at night though.  Also, when I grip something small, like a make-up brush or pen, my hand goes numb again.  I mentioned it to my Onco last week, but she never expressed any concern and just said to keep an eye on it.¥	For the last few nights it's also been very painful, waking me up and keeping me awake - if I get up and shake my arm a bit, the pain goes but returns the moment I lay back down again - I was awake for most of the night last night!   Also got that feeling in my elbow, like my funny bone's been hit, but permanently! ¥	Anyone else experienced anything similar?
