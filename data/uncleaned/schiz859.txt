In 2000 I met this guy. He was into tarots and magick. In the same time I met my soulmate we were friends when we were young. This person told me I was an angel and that I was Jesus. After a while Tiffany came to visit me in Norway from Texas. The best week of my life. The best..The first night she was there she told me about her father. That died in a fire. He tought he was possesed since military ca.23 or so he later sawarchangels and satan surrounding him and He burned himself with gasoline. Tiffany also told me about Her mom seeing Jesus pray between her and her grandmom in New york around 1960's. After the week of heaven I had this dream where I fell a sleep and then a man started chanting and evil language it was as if comming through me and my soul. then my chest vibrated EXTREMLY strong. After a week I freeked out with ultimate fear. Ever since it's been this evil around my chest where it vibrated and extreme fear. At first I thought it was this occult person that did it. Now I think It was Jesus. I might be crazy, but what are the chances of both of us thinking they are possesed! one in 100 billion. and jesus...and that magick guy telling me I am Jesus and my girlfriend is an angel... Please don't be mean.
