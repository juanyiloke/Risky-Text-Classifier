ÊCommunity psychiatric nurse/care co-ordinatorHi,ÊI went to see my cpn on wednesday this week as I am feeling agitated when I am not happy with people (phase I go through) but he reassured me that it was okay to feel agitated and that it will pass.He also asked me how I feel about not having a cpn as I am stable at the moment and that he will just refer me back to my psychiatrist on a 3 monthly appointment. I feel like I am being let down as I stay stable when I am seeing someone on a regular basis (seen him every 4-5 weeks), I am scared that this will affect my wellbeing.I lost my best friend last August 2014(who I met in psyche ward 14years ago and stayed in touch on a regular basis), she was in a psyche unit on a section and she was complaining of chest pains but staff dismissed her telling her it was her bipolar and that she didnt have any other problems....two days later she had a cardiac arrest ....they managed to restart her heart but she was brain stem dead and I stayed with her ( no family were present), right up until she was taken to have her organs donated (she was on the organ donor register), I am devastated because she was only ill every 2 years she had her cpn cut....and I am scared that this is going to happen to me.My voices are playing havoc and I dont know what else to do, I havent told my family how I am feeling as they will worry (I only have my dad and cousin).I am so frightened, I am still grieving for my friend...and normally when I am upset I ring her and we supported each other and now I dont have anyone to ring.
