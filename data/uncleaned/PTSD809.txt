ÊIntrusive memories and insomniaI am dead on my feet. The intrusive memories come from the moment i wake until the moment i am sent off to sleep by my medication. My head spins so much i feel sick and dizzy. I get bad headaches.I talk to the helpline all the time, most nights, sometimes days. I am on the list for more talking therapy.ÊPlease tell me how long this will last. It's been two years now and i don't know how much more i can take.I thought i was working through everything. Processing, but i feel like i'm getting worse sometimes. I cry, sleep, eat, cry, sleep, cry. My head races though, almost all the time.Fashbacks suck me into their world so that i'm not present. I'm having lunch with someone and my head is somewhere else and i can't hear what they are saying.My attention span is poor.I'm 32 and have been off work for 2 years. I need to live again. I need to work again. Im trying to take this time to heal my mind and help my brain to fix itself but it is taking too long.
