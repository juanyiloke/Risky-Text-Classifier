ÊWeird flashback thing...So the other night I had some super chaotic dream, with all kinds of ridiculous madness. But included cops with S.W.A.T gear and a largish building, and something about having to hide in said building...that morning I didn't really connect it to anything specific just figured I had managed to down to big a dose of the news/current events of the world and my brain was just trying to make sense of that. Well last night for some reason the thought of that dream entered my mind...then it seemed connected to the lockdown/shooting incident, and the more I thought about it the more I realized that is what it was and kept feeling like I had to keep from just like I don't know like falling out of reality...Though I knew the unlikelihood of passing out due to stress enough to somehow induce a comatose state where I'd be stuck in said dream/memory it sure felt like it could happen.ÊAnyways it freaked me out...couldn't get to my desk for the valium to take that, to calm it so ended up having to ride that one out except one of the cats was being somewhat comforting and purring so that helped some...eventually just felt exhausted and went to sleep, and did not repeat that dream to my relief. I had been in a bit of an argument with people earlier so I imagine it made me a little edgy but aside from that I do not recall an exact trigger.ÊI am ok now, but that was concerning...if that kind of thing continues then maybe I will believe some movie depictions of PTSD experiences aren't so far off/or exaggerated theatrically just to make it more intense for viewers.
