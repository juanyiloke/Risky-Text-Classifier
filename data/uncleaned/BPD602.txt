I Have Borderline Personality DisorderPositive traits of those with BPD:1. Passionate-experience extreme intensity of passion when we find something that interests us2. Individual-strongly cultivate our individuality and enjoy applying our abilities to new tasks3. Spontaneous-we live in the moment doing whatever it is we feel we want to do at that moment. Being free4. Curious-curious about Nything and everything, therefore taking more interest in people and their interests5. Intense-every moment of life is experienced at extreme intensity, experiencing life to fullest with both the highs and the lows6. Insightfulness- we have experienced so much pain in our pasts, we are able to draw on these experiences for the present moment via self awareness, helping ourselves and others7. Empathetic and compassionate-many of us have super empathy and can have a lot of compassion for those around us, whether we are feeling high or low.8. Creative-creative in our thinking and our doing.Hope this helps somebody and puts a smile on their face. It helped me :)
