Yes, well lets start at the begining served for 27 years...Posted over a year agoYes, well lets start at the begining served for 27 years in the Army.have been having flash backs and nightmares and the smell of burning that won't go away, and bad sleep patterns for years, never done anything about it apart from live with it.1971 active service in Oman attacked several times,fought back and escaped without a mark lots of local forces died.1973 tour in NI never wore a uniform just civillian clothes, got cornered in some back streets in Belfast, lucky to escape, fought way out1980 found my best mate he had hung himself, stayed with him for an hour before they dragged me away.1983 Falklands lots of crap, but was on ship when hit by bomb and trapped by fire this time couldn't fight back, the fire pushed me back felt so helpless, and guilty that I couldn't get others out.2006 now working for NHS, got attacked at work by a member of the public, he just kept coming at me, unable to fight back brought back the fearof the fire, that night the door opened and all the demons came back out.Have now been offered help through work should have asked years ago instead of putting my family through it.sorry just read it back and its hard to put it into words, hope you can understand my feelings.
