Anxiety of terrorism Ê12    This is my first post on here, just lookin for some help and ideas.I'm looking to go to America to do some travelling but everytime I think about having to fly i just feel sick. I'm fine with the flying part just the waiting around in the airport and waiting to bored as my anxiety is about terrorism rather than flying. I have suffered with anxiety for around 7 years and have managed to get over a lot of my fears but this anxiety about terrorism still gets me and stops me going going into town centres sometimes.Just looking for any ideas of what I could do to tackle my anxiety.ThanksAndy
