Hospital part 2

Well here I am again. Not sure how I feel about it, but was given 2 options - go in voluntarily or relinquish the decision to my wife who 'could' ask for me to be sectioned. I went for the first... To do otherwise could result in unnecessary bitterness.

Been here about an hour now and laying on my bed while I type this. For at least the next week or so I'm going to be stuck on the ward and not allowed to leave. 

Waiting for the on call doctor to come assess what level of observation I'll need. 

I understand the necessity for this I guess, had spoken to my wife and community nurse and was quite honest that I 'don't want to die' but I do want my brain to shut off... Has been leading to a lot of self harm and rather 'ultimate' ideation to do so (shut brain off permanently) 

For any that don't know me, in addition to depression and anxiety, I've been given the preliminary dx of Aspergers and adhd (fun fun fun  )

Anyway, as per last time, I figured I may as well write another blog like thread since I won't have much else to do and may help keep me occupied and be therapeutic. 

If it's anything like last time, could potentially (and I hope not) become quite heavy, hence the trigger icon. I am a self harmer and I know that for some a random post in the midst of many can hit hard so please use self care  I will use the trigger icon on such posts but I acknowledge even that can now and again be overlooked.

For obvious reasons, my mod duties are going to be limited for the meantime... So please pm any member of the community support team who are all complete stars and very friendly
