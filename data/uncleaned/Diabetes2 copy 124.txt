Is continuing blood sugar 14.5 worrying?New years eve 2014 my blood sugar went up to 30.4. I had been told by my doctor not to check my levels as I would panic but this day I did because I felt so ill. Over the next 3 months he increased my medication so that I am on 4 x 500 metformin daily and 4 x 80 gliclozide daily. Once my blood sugars were at a good level - average 6.5 - I was told to stop checking them regularly a.d told I cannot get test strips and lancets on prescription. I decided that for peace of mind I would buy my own supplies and check once per week. Everything has been fine until 27th December when it was 16.2. I have been testing once per day since then and only twice has it been below 10. Today it is 14.4. I am beginning to worry but given the doctor was adamant I should not home test do not know what to do. Any suggestions?
