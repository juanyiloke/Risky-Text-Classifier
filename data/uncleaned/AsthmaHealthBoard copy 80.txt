confused asthma, lung, sinusitis sxs________________________________________Hi everyone,This is my first post as I've found it helpful reading other's posts. Last October, I developed pneumonia that has since resolved, but recently relapsed. Along the way, I've seemed to have developed asthma and am now using Dulera, albuterol as needed, and Singulair. I'm also finishing up my 3rd round of prednisone for the pneumonia. I had a recent CT scan which does show sinus blockages. So now I'm working with a pulmonoligst for the lung and asthma sxs, and an ENT for the sinus stuff. I can't get a clear diagnosis, and maybe there isn't one that's clear. The ENT is suggesting that my ct shows chronic sinusitis and thinks that with surgery, it will also help my lung symptoms. I guess i'm very cynical because I never had any problems other than hayfever, before last October and now a whole bunch of sxs. Not sure how the pneumonia even fits the equation. I'm not sure what feedback I'm asking for but wondering if anyone else has had clusters of symptoms, and if so, were you told they were related to "chronic sinusitis", and if so, did surgery help? I hope this isn't too terribly confusing
