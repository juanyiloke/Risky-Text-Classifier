Bpd and self-awarenessby John Jackson » Thu May 07, 2015 1:26 pmHi, I'm new to the forums and not too used to writing in english so sorry if I sound offensive. I have/had a close friend who likely has a personality disorder, probably bpd. I'm not gonna go into too much detail but right now she hates me and thinks that I'm an evil person. We have one mutual friend who has gone through pretty much the same stuff with her but it was way worse for me for some reason. I really don't know what to do, she clearly doesn't want that I contact her but she didn't cut all the ties completely. Then again, I'm not sure if I want to be her friend if she doesn't realize she has a personality disorder. She actually admitted going to a therapy for a long time as a child. She even mentioned that the therapist said she has a "serious personality disorder". Now that I've thought about it, it was really weird of her to say something so personal when we barely knew each other. She said that she didn't have a reason to go to a therapy and I believed it, of course. I still care about her and feel pretty bad since many things she said about her difficulties in life make so much more sense now. Is there any way that she could become aware of her disorder now when she has already denied it for many years?
