401K or traditional IRA?2012-02-08, 01:05 PMHope someone could guide me to a proper path of my investmentsHere is my case: currently invest $5K/year in Roth IRA and 15% in 401K fund. This year I want to make a small change but don't know if it is logic to do so. For Roth IRA, it will remain the same. For 401K, I am thinking to invest only 6% instead (to get the company match), then I will open a traditional IRA and invest the other 9%. If you're curious what is the reason for changing, here it is. I just realize the average expense ratio in 401K is about 1.04% which is higher than the traditional IRA. About the return for last year with funds rated from 3-4 stars, I was down around 2.5% in 2011.With what I stated above, should I go ahead to make the change or remain the same?Thanks.
