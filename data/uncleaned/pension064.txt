Life before measles vaccination?Hi, I hope I'm OK to post here, I'm interested in hearing from those who remember life pre vaccination (which launched 1968).  Did people fear measles as they would say smallpox or was it considered typically a self limiting condition like chicken pox?  Did you personally know people who experienced complications from measles and if so what were they?I've found Mr Men books from the time and Tom & Jerry Cartoons where characters have measles, which would seem unusual if it was such a scary disease (ie making light of polio doesn't appear anywhere!)I know that the death rate was already v low when the vaccination was introduced, but complications are not recorded and wondered if they were commonplace.Many thanks in advance
