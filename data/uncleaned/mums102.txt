Hi ladies,Looking for advice on the above. I'm 35 weeks and trying to get organised! I have john lewis vouchers which I'm trying to use and found a Dr browns steraliser and bottles set for £46 and I was looking at getting a breast pump as I thought once breast feeding was established I could express and dad could do a feed but would I need to get the same brand of breast pump as my bottles so they can be used when required or are baby bottles standard sizes? Also I would want to use the steraliser for the bottles as well but would they fit.ÊThis is all so confusing and I'm maybe making it more difficult by limiting myself to John Lewis!
