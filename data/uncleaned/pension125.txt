Is anybody worried about North Korea ?After the sudden death of North Korean leader Kim Jong il there is a risk that North Korea could fall into a state of dangerous flux. It was reported yesterday that Kim Jong un - the son of the leader - is expected to step into his shoes and bring stability to the country but as he is only 28 years old and the powerful army generals want the control this transition might not be as smooth as some would like.It is a worry to me that such an unstable and heavily militarised country like North Korea - which incidentally has medium-ranged missiles and the capability to put nuclear weapons on them is controlled by such a sabre-rattling government.
