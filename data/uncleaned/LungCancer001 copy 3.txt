Hi, I'm wondering if someone can help my curiosity and worry reallyEssentially the situation is lung cancer was found, it was judged as stage 2 I believe, there was two tumors and due to breathing impossible to have surgery so only chemo could be done, which it seemed to work and shrink it. However on the follow ups quite awhile later apparently it's grown again after saying a few times it hadn't..Now there is a spinal fracture in which they said for awhile it wasn't cancer but now they say it probably is...and they now want to immediately book brain scans to check it it's spread to the brain.This is a 72 yr old woman, in reasonably good health apart from breathing too well...I'm kinda angry in a way because they put so many months between appointments and it allowed to grow, plus they kept saying the back pain and spinal problem was bone weakness leading to a fracture, now suddenly it's probably cancer, and that's been like that awhile now so..I'm kinda just bummed out, I don't know what to make of it, Is there any hope here? I don't really want false hope, I just want to grasp the situation fully, I don't have anybody to talk to about it properly.
