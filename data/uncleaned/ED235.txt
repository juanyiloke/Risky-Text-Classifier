 Out of ControlBingeing, restricting, bingeing, over-exercising, bingeing, restricting...and on it goes. I lost weight, and now I'm scared I've gained weight and I think about FOOD ALL THE TIME. What I'm eating, what I'm not eating, how many calories I'm eating, how many calories I am burning. It's making me goddam fucking crazy and I can't stop. And no one thinks I have a problem because I'm not skinny. But I do have a problem, and according to my BMI I am obese. The only way to get help for an eating disorder is to become under weight. That's the only time people will start to think you might have a problem. NO ONE TAKES ME SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I'M FAT Meanwhile my bank account is dwindling because of my binges.
