Recently sober alcoholic struggling with self forgivenessThank you for reading.I am 7 days sober and struggling mostly with guilt and self forgiveness. I have been an alcoholic for 8 years and during this time I did have sober periods but these were short lived.I am struggling to cope with the shame and guilt I feel toward myself and my alcoholism.  I have had poor judgement, made bad decisions and put myself in situations that made me extremely vulnerable because I was "blind drunk".  How can I forgive myself?  I fear that if I cannot find a way to forgive myself, I will drink to escape what I have done and who I have become.I would really appreciate hearing from others who have struggled with self forgiveness.  I would be especially grateful if you could share with me exactly how you were able to forgive yourself and move forward with your life.Thank you again for reading.
