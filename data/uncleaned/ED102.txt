ControlHey, it's me again. I am not quite sure what to do. I have depression and anxiety I take medicine for it. Due to events in my life I've been feeling really down. For the most part I've been able to handle my depression, but I feel like I'm losing control of my ED again. Or maybe it's the only thing I can control I don't know anymore. Like I want to get better don't get me wrong but I don't think I can eat anymore than I already do. Advice?
