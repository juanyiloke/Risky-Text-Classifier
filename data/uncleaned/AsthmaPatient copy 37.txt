Bronchospasm during anesthesia, bronchospasm general  8  I am in the COPD forum.  I cannot gather any info about anyone having a bronchospasm during surgery or even about bronchospasm.  I am truly hoping that someone can comment on anything they know or have experienced with this problem.   I was told after minor day surgery that I had a bronchospasm and that my oxygen went down to 85.   They got the numbers back up and just told me to do deep breathing and not lie around.   I did that.   Now my pft numbers are WAY down and my oxygen is also a few points down, still after 5 days.  Does this heal?  I am very concerned.Thank you for any information at all.
