Been 2 1/2 years since my accident and still hard!Posted 3 months agoI was run over my an artic lorry just over 30 months ago. Been looking for something like this where can talk to people who have been through simular situations as me. Ive had 37 operations so far and still have future operations to come. Ive made an amazing recovery from the injuries i had and am lucky to be alive as i died 4 times. Ive been reading through some of the other posts and people seem to get so down about things going on in there own lives, it gets hard sometimes but you have to pick urself up and carry on, you cant give up.If anyones struggeling and wants to talk im all ears.
