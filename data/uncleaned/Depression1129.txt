Dealing with the really dark moods.I have been fighting depression for a while now but lately I have been getting what I refer to as the really dark moods. They are something beyond the sadness or numbness that I usually get. I just feel like curling into a ball and crying at first and then I get irrationally angry. I feel like falling to my knees, holding my hands over my ears and screaming for the world to just shut up. I don't know what or who I want to shut up, that's just what I feel like screaming. They really scare me. They seem to happen randomly and can be triggered by the most insignificant reason. For example, today one of my really dark moods got triggered by getting frustrated by traffic. They always happen in the late afternoon or at night.ÊHas anyone else felt like this? How do you deal with them? I really struggle with them and can be stuck in one of these moods for many hours at a time. They only seem to go away with sleep but it always leaves me feeling extremely drained afterwards.Ê
