Schizophrenia? Or just Hypochondria?So, this has been going on for a while. I don't remember how long but it's not recent, it just hadn't occurred to me that it could be a serious issue until lately. In a day I'll be nineteen.So, first of all I'm paranoid. I recognize that I'm paranoid, but I still believe the thoughts and act upon them when necessary. Like my friends secretly don't want to talk to me, if someone says I look good they're lying, There are cameras almost everywhere (I don't wear jewelry. Tiny invisible cameras), people can hear my thoughts. Not just one person. Everyone. But that is usually only a problem with groups... I'm not a sociable person. It's not that I don't like people. It's that I am under the strong belief that people don't like me.I failed all of my college classes. I can't focus for the life of me, I forget just about everything, and I have no motivation at all. And when I say I have no motivation, I mean for anything. I can't force myself to keep hygienic, I can't stick to any project I start, school is just terrible because of it.I sleep. So much. A minimum of twelve hours a day if someone doesn't wake me up. Sometimes more, and I try not to. I slept through my alarm clock and an entire day of school once. I want to stay awake, I try, but I can't.One of these days I'll be able to move things with my mind. This I KNOW sounds ridiculous, but I just know it. I can feel it there.Last but not least. My father has Paranoid Schizophrenia.But the thing is... No hallucinations?I just really need some advice. :IOne more thing? Because of all the anxiety I have I'm still dependent on family. How exactly do I tell them about all this... They're going to call me a hypochondriac or just justify everything I tell them, and that's not paranoia, it's a fact.
