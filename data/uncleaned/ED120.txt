When to go inpatientI've had my eating disorder for 13 some odd years now, with several really horrible relapses from my first (time, encounter, experience, bout? how do you describe that?) with this being the first time I've ever gotten treatment. 25 years old, engaged to a wonderful man, getting my doctorate, and working part time and trying to deal with this demon that's been inherently part of my life since as long as I can remember at this point. I'm seeing a wonderful therapist, seeing a dietician soon, and an internist. Sounds like the power play to me, but my therapist has mentioned that residential treatment might be for the best at this point. I know that following the advice of a health care provider will be most individuals answer to this question, but my therapist left it up to me at this point. I guess my question is has anyone else felt that struggle of being on the edge of going to residential treatment, and then five minutes later thinking oh no thats not necessary, and then an hour later feeling so out of control of your mind that you think this must be what I need to do?So many things are holding me back from it...My job, my graduate school work, my fiancé (who supports whatever I do, so he isn't holding me back as much as I would hate to be away from him but at the same time feel like I'm ruining our future currently), and wedding planning. Not to mention that ego issue of admitting to people that I have a problem, all the while still living in denial about what is happening to some extent.AHH this is so much rambling and theres so many more feelings and worries associated with it but I just needed some support to know that I am not alone here.
