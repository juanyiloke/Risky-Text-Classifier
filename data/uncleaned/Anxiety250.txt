Do you feel like the pressure to always 'act normal' too much?Does anyone else feel like this?I often feel like I can only 'act normal' for so long, before my anxiety swamps me like a wave.ÊEach time it happens, I feel like I'm going to lose the things that are most important to me. And I try to keep the symptoms of anxiety at bay for as long as possible.ÊI know the idea is to learn how to 'duck dive' and get to the surface again without too much drama/damage after being hit by a wave of anxiety, because you know there will always be another wave, but do you ever feel like you're under pressure to stop the anxiety from impacting you altogether? It feels like pressure from other people, but really I know that I'm the one putting the pressure on myself.Sorry, I didn't explain that very well, not sure if it makes sense the way I've written it? I do feel the 'wave' analogy is a good one. It's like I'm wading in the shallows, trying to always keep an eye out for big waves, lest I get smashed by one, but it's very wearying to be on watch for them all the time. I feel like I can't relax because I have to be ready for when the next big wave comes in.
