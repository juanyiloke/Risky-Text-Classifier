Would you retaliate if hit by a woman?There's been a story doing the rounds over the past few days (some of you may have seen it) about a girl who pushed a guy to the ground and when he got up he punched her.In this particular case I think he shouldn't have hit her but IMO she definately deserved a push back.Thankfully I've never been in the situation where this has happened but I've seen men get hit in nightclubs by women, personally I'm of the opinion if you hit someone first expect one back.
