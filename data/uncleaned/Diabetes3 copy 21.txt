I did it!!So finally after a week of promising myself that i will inject insulin on my own like a big girl (LOL) i finally plucked the courage to do it!   well chuffed for myself...wasnt bad at all, although i did numb the crap out of the site of administration and saying that its stinging alot more now than when my mum normally does it maybe because of my shaky hands. I think for tomorrow i need to have a steady hand when administrating it and also breath lol i literally held my breath for 10 seconds when doing it, thought i was guna implode lool   small steps...but will get there.. Thanks all for the push! wouldnt have made the first step without you
