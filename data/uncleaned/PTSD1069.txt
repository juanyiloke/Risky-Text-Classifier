without professional help, like a website? I'm pretty sure i have it, but have not officially taken a diagnosis and do not intend to, for my own reasons (insurance and education-professional reasons). I have panic attacks at night and difficulty sleeping. When i fall asleep i wake up panicing , sweating and with rapid heartbeats several times during the night, and have a lot of nightmares. I cannot watch action/horror movies and freak out by these normal movies that other people watch with ease. Also i am easy to startle, and the main problem is that i fear sleep because i feel its a "loss of control". Does this sound like ptsd?
