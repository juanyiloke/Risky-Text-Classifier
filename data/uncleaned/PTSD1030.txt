How can I help my boyfriend, soon to be fiance? He had a bad childhood with his mom and his ex wife-abuse and treated him bad and he has PTSD. He will be on medical retirement from army. He haven't come home for 3 weeks. He is staying at some home shelter and wouldn't tell me where he is. I worried about him. He shut everybody out. He keeps saying that he is trash and I deserve someone better. I told him, that is not true. What should I do? Far I know, he is still in counseling and still on medicines. Why won\'t he come home? Why won't he return my calls or anything so I know he is okay? I read some stuff online about PTSD. They need space to recovery and they have to do it on their own. I do not know what to do. He said, he still love me and still want to be with me. How can I bring him home or help him? I keep reminding him that I love him and positive things. Told him, I'll be here for him. Any advices would be helpful. I'm running out of options but I'm not leaving him. I willing to wait for him.
