Dehydration   I had a pituitary tumor removed by crianial surgery, 5 years ago. I therefore, have more than one complication but relating to ndi specifically, I take DDAVP 4 times a day. I feel that I have been insufficently warned against the effects of dehydration by my doctors. My pet hates are central heating left on all night and conservatories or buildings with lots of clear glass. I work at being hydrated and am never without a bottle of water and eat plenty of fruit and veg but every now and then I am caught out and feel totally washed out and have no alternative but to go to my bed to rest for 24 hours.I wish I could do more to avoid it and would appreciate advice but at least this should serve as a warning to new sufferers.Thank you &amp; Best Wishes,John
