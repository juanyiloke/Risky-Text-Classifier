How do you handle depression?I'm weaning myself off of Lyrica for severe nerve pain in my feet because the Lyrica is doing terrible things to me. Aside from the weight gain, drowsiness and memory loss, it's making me very depressed. I find I have suicidal thoughts a lot, even though I know it's the drug talking and not really me. Either way, the depression is very real and at times, debilitating. There are days I can't get out of bed; there are days I can't deal with my diabetes. I have lost interest in so many things, I've even lost my appetite. But, I act as if nothing's wrong around friends and family. I feel comfortable enough here to talk freely and not get judged; I doubt even my closest friends and family will understand since they're not actually going through it. They'll just think I'm crazy! My own mother believes depression is a choice and your mind can control your emotions; too bad she doesn't understand that our emotions are also controlled by hormones and things! I try to hide it as best I can, but it's going to take a long time before I'm weaned off the Lyrica; plus, the doctor says it will take several years for the effects of Lyrica to leave my system, so in the meantime, I need to cope. I do not want to go see a psychiatrist. I'm just not ready. I think even I'm in denial, to an extent. I just want some way to take my mind off it while I wean myself off the Lyrica. Anybody have any ideas? I would really appreciate it. Thank you.
