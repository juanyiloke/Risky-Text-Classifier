08-15-13nodulesI was treated in the ER last week due to a car accident. While there I had a CT scan and was treated for a upper fractured spine with bracing and released. Much to my surprise yesterday I received a call from my Primary doctor stating that she had received a copy of the scan showing that I have a nodule on my left lower lung as well as a nodule on my right adrenal gland. Doctor wants to see me in her office to talk about this asap! My family has a long history of cancer, my dad died of pancreatic cancer at 46, and my mother died of kidney cancer at age 70, including numerous aunts and uncles . I am a 54 year old smoker, but do not have the classic lung cancer symptoms. The only thing I have noticed is that I have lower back pain that is bothersome while in bed sleeping. And a very slight left side chest congestion which was not there until after the accident. I have read that lung cancer can spread to the adrenal glands Anyone else had these symptoms? Thanks!
