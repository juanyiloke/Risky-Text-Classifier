Not Sure What The Problem IsIm 20. I recently transferred to a college about an hour away from my hometown. I have a lot of friends who go here and i know a lot of people here. This was something ive wanted for so long, i wanted to get out of my house, i wanted to live on my own and experience new stuff and for the longest time this is all i wanted. I suffer from GAD, social, ocd as well as depersonalization, derealization and dissociation from anxiety. Since ive got here ive just felt so weird. I cant really explain it. Anxiety about leaving and going back home, anxiety about losing all the money. Ive already transferred once so i cant transfer again. Before i came here i used to come down almost every weekend to see friends and absolutely loved it. I dont know whats wrong, im not home sick i dont really miss my parents or want to call them or anything so im not really sure what the problem is. Any one that can give me insight into whats happening and how to deal with it?
