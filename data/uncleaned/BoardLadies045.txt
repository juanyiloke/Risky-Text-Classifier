I think I have offended a friendHi Ladies Loungers. This is long, but I'd really appreciate a bit of help.I think I really fcuked up the other night. I don't know what to do about it. A friend asked me for some male advice, and it didn't end well.Lets call my friend T. T is a stunner. She is easily in the top 5% of good looking, "good catch" type women in Ireland.

Think of Amelia Earhart meets a blonde Kate Middleton. T doesn't walk into a room, she glides. When she speaks, her voice sounds harmonious. Every little movement she makes has something a little bit flirtatious about it, and you'd think to yourself "did she just do that? Nah its just my mind", then she'd look at you with a mischievous grin that conveys to you that she is the one in control, and yes, she probably did just rev you up to keep you on your toes. So the other night I met T in a certain pub.

Either way, I tried to keep that in mind. T was already in a bit of a mood, so I decided to proceed with caution. The conversation went something like this:
