Is it anxiety?Hi,I have been through a difficult interpersonal situation recently. As always both parties had a part of responsibility in it. However, now I have outbursts of shame (some are related to the situation and some just randomly about the whole of myself). Rationally I understand that I did not do any harm to anybody and in this situation the other person harmed me more than I did (and he had more opportunity and power to do so). But for the small things that I did wrong, I feel overwhelmingly ashamed. It's even like when somebody does wrong to me, I am ashamed about it as if I was the reason of this action. I start shaking because of the internal pressure and then crying.Do you know if this shame is related to anxiety? How should I address it?Thanks
