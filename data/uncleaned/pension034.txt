robbie savageHow come this moron escapes a driving ban, not for just a few MPH over the top, but nearly 30 MPH over the top, If I had been the next motorist in court that day, and received a ban, I would be seething, absolutely disgusting. he pleaded he cannot use public transport because people hate him, they probably hate him ever more now.
