ÊOvereatingDear all,it's been some weeks now I have these strong urges to overeat. And I do. It's not like I eat incredibly big amounts of food, but I do eat too much, definitely. It's not the first time it's happened to me. I use this as a way to calm myself and fill my internal emptiness. But afterwards I always feel like I'm a failure, because I so want to lose some weight, and this certainly won't help me. I still feel it's a better way to calm myself than cutting (which I haven't done for nine years!), but it's not a healthy way, either.Does anyone have any suggestions on how to stop this urge?
