I'm So ConfusedI'm always hearing "your PTSD is not your fault, what you're feeling is normal and understandable and should be validated blah blah blah" but then I also hear "you need to take responsibility for your feelings and your reactions you do have control etc.." I feel so alone, don't know what to think or how to feel. Does anyone feel like their therapist or supporters are contradicting themselves? I contradict myself a lot, I feel different things at different times and will react to different things at different times. One day I'll be okay with something and the next day I'll have a break down over the same thing. But I feel like it's wrong and confusing for me to be told to validate how I feel and accept it and work through it and not judge myself for feeling that way but also be told to basically feel bad for it... Might sound ridiculous but I'm confused.
