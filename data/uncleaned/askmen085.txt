Summer job for a student2012-12-02, 01:10 PMI'm a student from Europe. I study communications. In summer 2013 I would like to go to work in USA for let's say 3-4 months.ÊThere's a program in my country that offers you a job, but I have to pay 700USD just to get a job. Is there any web page that has a list of jobs for students in summer time? I don't mind working as a waitress, in a hotel, a shop, etc, but I would be very happy if I got a job in my area of study (PR, digital media, media, web pages etc.).
