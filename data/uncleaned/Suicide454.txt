Already in PurgatoryCarrie ann45 year old female. Single with no family and alone. Depression started for me when I was very young probably around 6 years old. Lived a horrible childhood with sexual and emotional abuse. First suicide in the family was when I was 15, my mothers brother….and then my own mother at 25. I have lived this cycle over and over for so long it has become a way of life. I am not sure I even know what normal is. As I have gotten older the depression has become much more severe and the feeling of worthlessness just doesn’t go away anymore. The strange thing is I maintain a job and am able to function only when at work. I put on a brave face everyday even though I have so much social anxiety, I close my office door and only interact with people if I have to. I have broken done at work at lot even though I don’t think anyone even knows. I am so afraid of anyone knowing how I really feel inside but its gotten un manageable for me. I wake up crying a lot and can barely clean the house or care for my 2 dogs. I think about leaving this all behind a lot. I have visited doctors lots of times and the cycle just keeps going on. It seems that history just keeps repeating itself…..
