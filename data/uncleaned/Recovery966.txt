a lesson from a 7 year old child, this is insightful!One rainy afternoon I was driving along one of the main streets of town, taking those extra precautions necessary when the roads are wet and slick.*Suddenly, my son Matthew spoke up from his relaxed position in the front seat.*"Mom, I'm thinking of something."*This announcement usually meant he had been pondering some fact for a while and was now ready to expound all that his seven-year-old mind had discovered.*I was eager to hear. "What are you thinking?" I asked.*"The rain," he began, "is like sin and the windshield wipers are like God, wiping our sins away."*After the chill bumps raced up my arms I was able to respond. "That's really good, Matthew."*Then my curiosity broke in. How far would this little boy take this revelation? So I asked... "Do you notice how the rain keeps on coming? What does thattell you?"*Matthew didn't hesitate one moment with his answer: "We keep on sinning, and God just keeps on forgiving us."*Who can drive in the rain again without thinking of this one???*
