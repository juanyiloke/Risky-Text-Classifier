Wanting recovery, but scared.Hello, I am new to this site, or any online forum of any kind for that matter. The thought that I may say something stupid or be judged/rejected in any way scares me so much, that I have been unable to reach out for the support I desperately need to anyone. Even though this is an anonymous way to get/offer support, it still causes me a great deal of anxiety...so please be kind if you choose to respond.I am so overwhelmed by life seeming to be nothing but an enormous mountain of problems and things I need to overcome that I really have no idea where to start or how to begin or even if I am capable. My therapist says I first need to make the choice to recover from my ED and then be 100% committed to it. Makes sense, but I am so scared that I "can't" recover. I have a list of 1000 reasons in my mind why it's not possible and why I won't be able to cope with life without it...not to mention what if I try and fail!I really don't want to live with the total insanity and misery of the ED any more, but the fear of change and the fear of the unknown somehow seem a thousand times worse.Just feeling hopeless... Any advice on how to choose recovery and commit to the work of recovery when you are COMPLETELY paralyzed by fear would be appreciated.
