Lady on ITV West looking to become a Euro MPDear Madam,I think  am just about to retire and have edited ITV news for some thirty years. I have a deep knowledge of the media and although I wasn't at work yesterday enjoyed your piece with Ken Goodwin. I missed your caption so didn't catch your name. I will find it tomorrow at the studios. This is just a quick note to ask you to contact me if you can and if I can help your -----shortly to be our -----cause then I will do my best.kind regards,Terry
