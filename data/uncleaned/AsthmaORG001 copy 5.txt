Finding out triggers HiCan anyone suggest any ways to work out what might be triggering my asthma. There are some things that I know definitely trigger my asthma like smoke, feather duvets/pillows and Christmas trees! I have hay fever which doesn't seem to be much of a problem at the moment as I'm taking hay fever tablets. But I can't quite seem to work out why my asthma won't settle down and 'get out of the way' like it always used to. I'm currently using my reliever inhaler most days once or twice but at seemingly random times with no apparent correlation to what I'm doing or where I am. Has anyone any suggestions of how to work out whats triggering it.ThanksSoggysheepy
