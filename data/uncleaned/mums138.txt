Hi AllI'm just after a bit of advice if anyone is/has been in a similar situationI have a lovely 5 year old boy, his father and I separated before I found out I was pregnant and have since divorced. He has always lived with me and we have both moved on with our lives, and I am remarried and his father has a girlfriend.He has regular contact with his father and sees him every other weekend and as often as possible.ÊHowever, he came home last night after spending 5 days with his dad. He was initially upset and then seemed to calm down and went to bed fine. however, I went to check on him and he was in floods of tears saying he wanted to go back to his dads and then said he wished he could cut himself in two and stay half with me and half with him.I was heartbroken to say the least and didn't know what to say to him other than give him a big hug and tell him I love him.He's never said anything like that before. He's usually a very happy, cheery boy, and he loves his step father too and has a very happy home environment.What can I say to him? Any advice appreciated xx
