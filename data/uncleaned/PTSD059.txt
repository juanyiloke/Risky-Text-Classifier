Doubting Your Own Trauma History?Does sometimes doubting that your own history is true make it untrue? Like... I have memories of sexual abuse. I have triggers connected to those memories, and I show signs of those incidents that others, even some people my own age (I'm almost 15), pick up so that they understand what's happened... I have flashbacks that make me feel like my body is being raped or my mouth is filled with semen.But I sometimes doubt myself anyway? I don't struggle with nightmares that much, I don't dream often and sometimes my dreams are so weird and confusing but I don't have flashbacks at night, and my bad flashbacks are not that often? Like I think of the things I remember without being able to stop it pretty much all the time, sometimes the same memory repeats and repeats and repeats while I disconnect from reality and don't know where I am... but I don't feel like I struggle enough for those things to have happened to me? I've suppressed a lot and it's coming back and I hate it and I feel these things on my body but sometimes, like right now, I just really tell myself that it can't be real and that I'm making it all up? I'm not even sure if I'm doubting or denying, the latter is maybe more likely.I just need advice on how to deal with telling yourself it's not real and telling yourself you're not sick enough for it to be real... I can't be the only one with this issue?Still... I KNOW it has to be real... Deep down I do, I guess? I'm always emotionally distanced from it, it's my world and it's the memory world. I spend a lot of time in the memory world but it's still distanced from my feeling because I don't know what would happen if I let it integrate itself into my mind as a usual memory... I feel like that would take too much acceptance and that I'd be overwhelmed with feelings... Integrating it into my mind in that way would make it too real, while I think I really need that.... ugh
