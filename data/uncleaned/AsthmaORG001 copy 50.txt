Daughter in intensive care Its escalating, help! My daughter has just turned 13 and she has had asthma all her life. For the last 9 years she has been under a consultant and although shes had many attacks they have been mild and managed by the gp or a&e with a few nebs and steroids. However in Aug 2013 she had an attack that landed her in hospital and since then shes been admitted 44 times! It is exhausting but she never got to the point she needed intravenous medication unitl about 5 weeks ago when shenhad an attack that was off the scale. She stabilised in hospital but after being in there for a day and a half she suddenly crashed and her blood gasses were at 15 for co2. She went blind and disorientated and it was incredibly frightening. She was on 50% oxygen via an airvo machine pumping warm o2 into her, iv hydrocotrizone, salbutamol and in the end it was the iv magnesium that stabilised her. She was moved to Intensive care but recovered quickly. 5 days after discharge the school called an ambulance and she was rushed to resus and admitted back onto the high dependency unit on iv's again. 7 days after discharge shes back in and then 4 days after discharge (shes still in hospital now) she is back on then iv's and I am at my wits end. I have had asthma all my life and Maria has has too but it seems shes just getting worse and worse. On the last admission she was stretched to hourly nebs and steroids. Then 12 hours later on the ward under the care of the consultant she deteriorated and didn't respond to back to back nebs and I just don't understand why or how its gotten so bad and so frequent. Is this normal in brittle asthmatics? we have had 44 admissions in 18 months and the last 3 out of 4 have required critical care. Please someone tell me this will get better!!!
