Well, I give up. Too much. Too damn much. I'm not going to go in details because everyone has their reason.I will not go out with a bang by shooting myself or using pills or make a spectacle of myself…I just want to melt away…Disappear.Never exist.Everyone thinks my diet is really a diet but I'm just slowly trying to kill myself but the process is too slow to my liking. It's a game to me to see the numbers go down because with each drop I'm closer to being dead.I do not even feel hunger anymore. I do not feel pain.So dehydration seems like a better alternative to starvation.
