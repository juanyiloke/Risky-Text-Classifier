Not happy farming________________________________________Looking for some help from you good people .i took over my family dairy farm 6 years ago from my parents after my dad got sick and unfortunately I'm not enjoying it .There are many jobs I don't mind doing but I don't enjoy anything about the work with cows and don't have any passion for it anymore .I hate milking I feel under huge pressure from all my parents and family to keep it all together. I'm reasonably good at it but still I struggle to manage the finances and stay interested in progressing the business. I have other skills and talents so I don't think il have a problem getting work . However making a career change will break my fathers heart as there is no one else to run the farm and the farm is many generations old. It's easy to say make the change but more than likely it would be at the cost of losing family relationships as leasing or selling the farm would be a catastrophe for our home. The situation is difficult to deal with on a daily basis and sometimes I get down about it Help please if you can
