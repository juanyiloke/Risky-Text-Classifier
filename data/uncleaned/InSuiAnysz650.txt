I'm lazy, worthless, and weak. I tried to commit suicide 10 years ago, got over it, emerged feeling strong and renewed, and then I find myself exactly back where I started ten years later. I apparently have learned nothing, have accomplished nothing. I spent all morning today trying to hang myself and finally gave up. I have no one to blame but myself. I was in a wonderful relationship that I let fall apart, and she has moved on and I'm completely flailing. I can't focus enough to do any kind of job, I can't summon the strength to make myself better...I really feel like all the wonderful people around me would be better if I were just a memory, and no longer around ******* up my life and their hopes for me.
