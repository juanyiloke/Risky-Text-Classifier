ÊHow do I report an unethical therapist?I have been seeing a therapist since August or September. She seemed really nice. She claimed to be a Christian. Well, I started babysitting a week or two ago. She thought that that was horrible of me. She threatened to call Child Protective Services on me for babysitting (I do have schizophrenia, but it is well controlled with meds). I called her yesterday, because I wanted to babysit, so I found a new counselor, one who wouldn't judge me. Well, she said she was going to call CPS. I told her I would stay with her and not babysit, and she said she wasn't playing my stupid games. I am so mad. Well, a few hours later, the cops are at my door, and they are saying that they had gotten a call saying that I had stopped seeing my therapist and that she was worried that I was suicidal. Today, Adult Protective Services showed up saying that they had a complaint that I was living alone and was't capable of doing so. First of all, I live with m dad, and my counselor knew this. She had told them that I wasn't taking my meds, and that I didn't make enough money to make it through the month. I never gave any implication as to any of this. I would like to report her, as she went out of her way to make things up out of the blue, and I don't want her to be able to do it again to someone else. Luckily I wasn't hauled off to the hospital. I won't let her get the best of me. CPS hasn't yet showed up, but I don't doubt that they will. I am so angry right now. I need to know of the proper avenues to go through. Please help!!
