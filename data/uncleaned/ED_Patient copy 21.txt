What constitues an eating disorder?This will probably be the most ignorant question ever, but I really need some help understanding. All I know is that my eating patterns are definitely not normal or healthy.I have some days where I'll snack and eat normally, but I'll hate myself afterwards. And some days where I absolutley refuse to eat, even to the point where i'm cold and tred I just drink tea/water. For some reason I love feeling empty, I feel lighter. I need to lose weight.However, I haven't lost any weight. I don't meet the criteria for anorexia or bulimia. I tried purging once, but I only gagged until my eyes watered and I saw stars. But nothing came up and I felt worse.I know this isn't normal, I also have severe health anxiety which messes with my appetite sometimes. But usually I'm making a concous decision not to eat to lose weight, but I haven't lost any weight so I don't think what I have counts as some sorm of eating disorder. Any thoughts or advce on this?I'm so sorry this is a silly question, I don't articulate very well.
