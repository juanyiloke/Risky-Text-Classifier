help pleaseHi ive just introduced myself on another thread but would like some advice please.I was diagnosed 2 months ago because i went to docs feeling terrible.within 3 days i was at clinic in hospital being told i was diabetic and shown how to take insulin. im sure the nurse gave me lots of info but you an imagine not much went in. i was told to inject twice a day lots of stuff about food and to phone her in three days. i did phone with my readings. she advised me to alter the dose and said to give her a ring sometime in the next week. not very helpfull. i visited y doc who wasnt happy that ide been sent to hospital and seemed reluctant to advise. he did say i would need blood test for antibodies to see if i was 1 or 2. i have now waited 6 weeks for test to come back. is this normal. do they usually take this long. i recieved a letter to tell me ive been put on waiting list for a DESMOND course. dosnt seem to make sense. DESMOND is for type 2. if they do t know what i am whats the point, wont it be a waste of time. can anyone tell me how long this test should take. sorry for rambling im just so lost. i think im managing sugar but only just. i have a very physical job, how can i eat enough to get me through the day and take insulin so keep levels ok. i gettin a few hypos. is it cos im taking to much insulin or not enough food i just dont know.i asked to go to diabetic clinic at docs but was told no point they wont say anything until they decide if im 1 or 2. i feel like im going round and round.sorry for rambling
