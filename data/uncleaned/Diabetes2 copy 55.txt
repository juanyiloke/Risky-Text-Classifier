Diabetic blood check/chiropodist  10  I am type 2 Diabetic, but never 100% as to when you doctors surgery would require you to have routine fasting diabetic blood test or as to how often you should see a chiropodist.last blood test was May 2013 & the chiropodist was 6 months ago, I only managed to see the chiropodist after asking my doctor for a referral otherwise I would never have seen the chiropodist.I must add that Feb 2014 I had major surgery to the left ankle to save the foot due to poor circulation.Any feedback would be much appreciated and would like to take this time to say thx
