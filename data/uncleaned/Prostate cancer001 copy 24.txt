My Dad survived but can i get checked? Hi All,A couple of years back my Dad was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and luckily enough got through it and seems to be doing well now. Not only did my Dad have it but 2 of his brothers too. My Dad has suggested that I and my brother get checked for it ASAP but having spoken with my GP they refuse to do it until I'm 45-50. This may sound stupid but I'm only 32 and my brother 33 but i just think its something that needs checking, are there any options open to us or do we need to seek a private check and if so where? Thanks Guys.JoeJoe Kandekore (Candyman) Dear Friends,I have just heard today that Joe Kandekore (Candyman), passed away on April 22nd.A lot of us were wondering what was happening after we received no email replies, and today our B2PCa webmaster (James Grant) received a message from Joe's nephew giving us the shock news. Joe was diagnosed in 2008 aged just 43. He had a long tough fight, and I suppose we all knew things were really bad when he   here last in March.His story is here: JOE PROFILE Many of you will have met Joe at Leicester numerous times, and at the London 'do' as recently as December 2013.He was a tremendous, fun-living guy, always upbeat witha zest for life. REST IN PEACE JOE
