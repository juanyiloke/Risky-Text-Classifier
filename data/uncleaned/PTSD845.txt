ÊPTSD night terrorsI've been in therapy all my life dealing with the many traumas I experienced as a child and young woman. It has helped me a great deal but I think some traumas can be so severe, the best I can hope for is to have an arsenal of coping methods and accept that I'm going to experience some pain and fear at times. In the past year I have begun talking in my sleep during my frequent nightmares and then the dreams changed. They became so viscerally real,I would respond by screaming,cursing and physically attacking my husband. All while still asleep! He's a big man and manages to get hold of me, desperately shaking me and calling my name to wake me. When I wake up I am terrified, convinced I was being assaulted. It's so disturbing for both of us. Anyone else experience this? My therapist doesn't seem to have an answer other than to talk about it. But the terrors keep coming.
