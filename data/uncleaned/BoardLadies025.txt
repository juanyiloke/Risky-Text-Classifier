Breast surgery recommendations?hi there, so i'm pretty sure i want to get breast augmentation. i always had big boobs but i have gotten in better shape of late (lower body fat %) and my boobs are not as full as they used to be. its holding me back from getting to where i want to be. my query is basically i have no clue how to go about it, clinics, doctors, home or abroad etci would really appreciate if anyone could offer any advice or tips on where to go or where to look or any accounts of personal experiences. for isntance is the risk worth travelling abroad? if so where?any and all feedback appreciated
