Do you take success into account when considering relationships?Let's say you meet an amazing girl at a point you are still finding yourself in life, do you feel any pressure to further your career/studies so that you will have more to offer, or do you just enjoy the relationship and satisfy the rest later?In my experience there is often pressure on guys to have a stable income and/ or lifestyle, the same way the guy is expected to ask a girl out or propose.
