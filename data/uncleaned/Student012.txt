uni transfer!!by aledora01I was at the university of Wolverhampton for 2 years but now im taking a gap year and i decided that I want to transfer to another university but do the same course. I have been told that it is difficult to be accepted to other unis from Wolverhampton but I really want to do it. I have no idea how transfers work. I assume I should be looking for a uni at the same level. Do I email the other unis and ask what qualifications they need? Do i re-apply through ucas or do I just send them my current documents and uni grades? any advice will be much appreciated. Thank you .
