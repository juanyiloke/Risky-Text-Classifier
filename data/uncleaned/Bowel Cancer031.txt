My mojo is back!!Following my last post about my bad scan results, I'm now back on track!Never one to give in gracefully, I have a plan. It may not be a foolproof plan, but it's a start. I'm re doubling my efforts on the anti cancer diet. I normally have two or three cups of the green stuff, so I'm upping it to six! I occasionally forget the turmeric, but not any more. And I've just stocked up on the blueberries. I even had a glass of wheatgrass and spirulina earlier (gag :-\). I feel better already!  Thanks for the support as usual. I can't let you lot go battling on and leave me behind!!
