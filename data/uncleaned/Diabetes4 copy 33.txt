Midnight, three and sixThis is a short movie portraying a girl of 15 with T1 and her mother and the life they lead. IMHO it shows a very skewed idea of what life with T1 is like and what being a parent of a girl of 15 who has T1 is like.  The title says it all.  The parents take it in turn to be "on duty" to wake at midnight, three and six to check the daughter's levels.  Why can't the daughter do it herself at 15 and why don't they save themselves all the bother and get a CGM?  The film continuously stresses that T1 is a virtual death sentence, but doesn't at all tell the other side of the story which is that these days it's a barrier to nothing!It's caused quite a bit of controversy in the FB groups.  There's an excellent opinion piece here
