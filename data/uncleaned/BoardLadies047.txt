interstitial cystitisHiya, I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in March of this year. There doesnt seem to be a lot of information or understanding from the medical profession and it all seems a bit hit and miss for treatments. I am curious if anyone else has been diagnosed and what has helped or hindered them in dealing with this condition. I have encountered various different issues myself and have also found a number of methods that may help other sufferers  . if anyone is interested or would like to discuss this condition. ?
