Constantly under surveillance________________________________________Hi all,Im a long time lurker first time poster but staying anon. Just wondering what all your opinions are on this, I work in a small retail store- the usual set up one man owns the shop and theres no other managers or supervisors we work under his instruction etc I have just recently joined this new staff set afterworking in a previous shop for several years. My problem is thoughthat my boss has the cameras on his phone and he constantlyseems to be on them. Theres a big tv screen in the shop for staffand customers to see and then cameras in the office etc but he has mentioned to me on occasion that he checks the cameras on his phoneregularly for start, finish times etc and to check people eating, robbing etcIm just wondering where I stand with this. I understand that cameras areneeded for security of course but I feel constantly watched and everythingis scrutinised down to a tee. Hes difficult to get on with at the best of times.Any opinions welcome thank you.(P.S. When I say eating I mean staff getting a roll or something and of course paying for it because none of us get breaks so we have to tryand eat behind the counter between customers)
