But the prices are outrageous. A decent room in some families house runs $800.00 per month in the south bay. In Gilroy it's a lot cheaper. I want to stay in this area but I am considering moving to a whole new area and looking for a new job there. But in the back of my mind is the fate of a guy who was living in my board & care home in 1995. The guy made too many changes at once. #1) He moved out. #2) He quit his job. #3) He stopped taking his meds. #4) He closed his bank account and got cash. A month later the owner of our board & care informed us they found him laying outside, dead with $3000.00 cash on him.
