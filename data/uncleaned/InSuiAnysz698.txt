I Just Give Up I don't know where to begin. I am so tired and in so much pain. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try and what I do for everyone else, it is never enough. Both my parents died before I was 30. I was and continue to be forced to shoulder the relentless, unending, thousand pound weight of my deceased grandmother's (who treated me like crap for years) burdens. I was just recently betrayed by what I thought was a true friend, who turned out to be nothing more than a freeloading loser who people warned me about. I am nearly broken, am invisible to women and fail at everything I attempt, career or otherwise. I just wish I had the courage to overdose or put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. I am not try to glorify suicide in any way. I am just sick and tired of life, if you want to call it that. Thank you for lending a sympathetic eye and ear.
