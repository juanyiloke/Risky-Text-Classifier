DD is just 3 and I am due our second very soon. DD is pretty demanding, not remotely interested in doing anything by herself, and today has driven me nuts with constant demands followed by relentless whinging when told no. She's in bed now, thankfully she sleeps well, and I have been sat here thinking that soon I won't even have this time to breathe and watch TV/read mn.I just don't get it. How do you deal with a toddler whinging AND a newborn crying, especially as everything I read says that the arrival of said newborn will send the toddler nuts. And when do you get any time to yourself/peace and quiet/sanity?! Or do you just not? Because of course the newborn will go all through the night too.ÊI have such a creeping feeling of dread about how I'll cope with it all when just one of them alone can drive me round the bend.ÊAny survival tips very welcome...
