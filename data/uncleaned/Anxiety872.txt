Êseeking helpGood day ,I suffer from GAD or at least I think I do before that I was suffering from severe panic attacks but I got over them and they are long gone I was prescribed pxil 20 mg for my panic attacks and it worked to cure my panic attacks after that I tapered down until I stopped using them.the reason I'm writing is that i'm suffering from constant thinking abut everything and I cant stop I tried using that method of accepting my thoughts but it left me empty inside which brought me more anxiety,sometimes I get an anxious feeling out of no where. i'm afraid of losing my mind or even dying even though I know that anxiety wont do that.Maybe i'm writing for reassurance but in conclusion I don't know what or how to think anymore if I accepted my thoughts I'll be anxious and if I argue with them I'll be even more anxious.P.S please don't tell me to go see a psychiatrist because the last one didn't even bother to let me finish explaining what I feel and instead gave me paxil and inderal (propranolol) and I don't know of any qualified ones near me.
