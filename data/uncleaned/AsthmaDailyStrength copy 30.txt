it takes me about an hour to find a position that I am comfortable to sleep in because of my breathing. Sometimes I wake up and I find that I am short of breath because of how I have slept and it's just at night right now when my asthma is a problem. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this problem? I currently sleep on two pillows because using only one also makes me short of breath, but it's also just too hot and even with my windows open I find it hard to sleep. I'd really appreciate your help on this.
