What's the craziest thing your doctor's ever said?It was my 30th birthday and I went to see a highly recommended ophthalmologist for my retinopathy. He did some tests and in the end, I ask him, "So, what's the prog, doc?" And he says, "You have some active bleeding, but there's nothing we can do now. However, if you live another 5 years, we can take care of it." Gee, I didn't know 30 years was the end of the line! Happy 30th birthday, to me! What about you? What's the craziest thing your doctor ever said to YOU? Thanks!
