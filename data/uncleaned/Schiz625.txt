ÊComing off medsI am coming off Risperdal consta after around 6 months on it and don't want to go back on it already as I hate the side effects, but just the other day at work I wondered if I am starting to hallucinate again or something because a few times people would be talking to me and then they would say something a little odd that reminded me of what I dealt with before at work before I walked out and was hospitalized and put on the shot. One example is today at the end of the day my boss was showing me how to do something and then said "you don't look mentally stable to me so you can sue me". I didn't reply as I was used to hearing weird **** at work and thought I may be hallucinating or something. It happened sort of around another guy yesterday also. I don't know what to do except just tell myself they are not really talking to me, but that didn't help in the past for long. I read it can take up to 3 months to get back to "normal" after meds. I hope it isn't all coming back again. I am worried that I will start hearing voices again also. It makes me feel like I should maybe need to quit my old job and start fresh, but I worry it will be difficult for me to readjust. I already am on ssd currently in the work trial period.
