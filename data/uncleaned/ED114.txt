Too Old to be dealing with this againGreetings....I am 53 years old and am trying really hard to control this situation. I have been treated in the past for an eating disorder (I think I was in my mid 30s) and have had flare ups since. I know the signs and the feelings that surface but right now I am struggling to figure out how to get past this. I am too old to be dealing with this....right? I have not mentioned this to my boyfriend because he does not always understand. He is supportive and will help but I dont want to let him down so he thinks I cant take care of myself. I come off like I have complete control and can handle everything but wow, inside I am struggling. Does anyone have any tips / ideas what woks for you?
