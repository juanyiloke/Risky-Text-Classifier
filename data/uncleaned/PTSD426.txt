 PTSD with no medsI stopped my meds and self medicating well most days.. I still enjoy some whiskey from time to time. I was in a hole a very deep dark whole.. I finally came out of it and I'm not sure I can handle it. I have TBI on top of PTSD.. My memory is ****... I don't know to cope I have no support besides my therapist. I started group therapy.. But it's called DBT and most of the people in group are addicts or have other issues. None with mine which doesn't help the ALONe factor. Sometimes I think that if I just shove myself back into that place and go numb to get through everyday life that I might make it.... Idk I don't even know if this makes sense to anyone... I disappear somewhere inside myself when I'm driving.. I will be heading home and end up somewhere else confused, and crying.. With no recollection.. I am broken I have no trust I have no faith. All I want is to be free
