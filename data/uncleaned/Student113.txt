Redo first year or go onto second?by DegHello I'm studying mechanical engineering and this year hasn't been the best for me with university and I most likely see myself needing to retake this year.The issue with this is that I have already undertaken a foundation year and if I redo this year student finance will not fund all of the course (already a 4 year course sandwich not including foundation) and one year will be unfunded and I don't know how I'll even pay the tuition fees.For the engineers out there how important are first year grades for placements/careers? Is it worth retaking a year to make sure I get at least a 2:1 or would it be better to just move onto second year although the chances of me passing all my modules this year are slim.
