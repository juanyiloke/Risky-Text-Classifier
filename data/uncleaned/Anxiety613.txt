Finding small noises irritatingDoes anyone else experience this problem? The smallest of noises seem to wind me up, things like chewing, tapping, clearing throats, e.tc. People clicking the mouse when they are using a computer can really irritate me too. These things do not irritate me all the time but if it starts getting to me it just builds and builds with me getting steadily more irritated with the person although I know that it is in no way their fault.It doesn't go as far as making me fly into a rage but it comes close sometimes.Does anyone else get this and do you have any tips on coping?
