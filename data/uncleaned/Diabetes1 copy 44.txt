Interesting Chat the Other Dayus girls from work had a wee catch up lunch last week, one of the girls has recently left to work somewhere else, so it was kind of a leaving do.She's been diabetic for about 8 yrs, but has gone off the rails the past couple of years, put weight back on and has watched a rise in her BG.Not knowing much about diabetes while we worked together I never really paid much attention to what she ate, but we were chatting about it over lunch.I told her I was doing LCFF and excercise to try and see how well I could control things without meds and she asked me about the LCFF bit.She said - she eats lots of fruit and veg, wholemeal bread, baked pots and has porridge every morning for brekkie that's what she was told to do, along with taking metaformin.I tried to explain the LCFF as best as I could, but she was adamant it was wrong and not what she was advised - in the next breath she said "my BG is rising, so the doctor told me my next step is insulin anyway". I was like   "let me try again".I've suggested a meter, and read on here.It's never too late is it?
