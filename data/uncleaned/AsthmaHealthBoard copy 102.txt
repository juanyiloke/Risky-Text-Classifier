  Bronchial asthma joy!!________________________________________Well started coughing again after only being better a week or so. Long story short bronchial asthma and some virus. Feel better after fever and aches went away. Only missed one wk day to see dr on Friday. Was rough day today . Used rescue inhaler every 4hrs. Coughing all day. Was started on Prednisone as of Saturday. Not sure what it is suppose to do for me. Or what side effects it has. I feel bad complaining there are others much worse off then me. But I just can't deal with this. Can't breath right. Taking Musinex to help loosen mucus. It helps a bit only so far. I am new to this but my guess is I am in the yellow zone. Though have no Asthma Action plan written. I know to take rescue inhaler when I cough and can't breath correctly. Cough med with codeine helps me sleep but wake up every 3-4 hrs bad coughing fit and need more. I pray for relief soon. Thanks for listening everyone . Goodnight .
