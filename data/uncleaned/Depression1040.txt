I've hurt the man I love with my depressionHi,Ê Ê Ê Yet again going through depression..Not sure what path to take any more. ÊYes meds is step 1 but through all this I have hurt my relationship with the most amazing man. ÊHe is not sure where our future is now after another one of my melt downs.This makes it all so much harder to know I may not have him.Why do I push him away when it gets hold of me. I hate it and myself right now because I may have lost the love of my life.I just want to be well and happy. Have a great life with him. ÊJust overwhelmed with sadness, fear and guilt.Will this pain ever end and find balance5Ê
