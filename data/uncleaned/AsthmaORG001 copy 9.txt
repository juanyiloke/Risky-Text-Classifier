Am I crazy?! HI, I'm sure I'm not crazy but if anyone could offer some advice to prove this that'd be great, thanks. :) To cut a long story short I'm currently taking fostair, talfast (fexafenadine) and Puriton to try and control asthma/allergies. I went to see my Gp today as been getting very tight chested and swelling over weekend. He suggested taking prednisolone for a week to prevent things getting out of hand. My first question is: is there anything else I could do that means no pred as had a ridiculous amount already this year and it's only April!? Second question is that I finally plucked up the courage to ask for a referal after the last time 3 yrs ago was a disaster. The consultant decided I didn't have asthma (because at the time I had no symptoms) which led to me not taking my asthma seriously and many exasperations. Has anyone else been to see a specialist and it not gone well? After seeing my gp today I'm starting to chicken out of going in case the same thing happens again. Sorry for the ramble but I'm just about taking control of things but wondering if more can be done. I'm not sure I can take another consultant tell me I don't have asthma because I don't wheeze! Thanks for listening!
