Tears of joyhello guys, Well today I've made it home after having my DIEP flap reconstruction on Tuesday, this morning when I got dressed for the first time and saw my cleavage I have to admit I did cry a few tears ( but tears of joy).I'm black and blue and look like a character from a Tim Burton film lol! It's hard to believe these scars will ever fade but I know they do. They are my battle scars and I'm proud off them. Sometime down the line a need a serious down size and up lift on the left. But for now I'm happy and have feet UK watching the tennis.love to all of you still facing your battlek
