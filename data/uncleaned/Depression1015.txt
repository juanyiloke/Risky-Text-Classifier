It never seems to get betterIt gets to this time of night. Surprise surprise I'm sad. I'm so sad it hurts my chest and I can't breathe and I cry myself to sleep. I don't have many friends anymore, and my depression feelings are getting more frequent.ÊI just feel so alone. So very very alone and I wish I could just lie in my bed and sleep all the time. I don't want to see anyone or go to work. I don't think about dying anymore, but I sure don't want to be around here either. It doesn't help that the person I thought might have liked me... Doesn't even think about me. Nope. It makes me feel so stupid and even more lonely and for some reason I can't stop thinking about them.ÊÊeverything I do wrong plagues my mind endlessly. I get so paranoid. Even if that person were to like me it wouldn't matter because I'd get so paranoid I'd push him away anyway.ÊÊeveryhing I do and say is wrong, I always speak and say the dumbest things that annoy people and drive them nuts. I don't know what to do anymore. I honestly can't stand this and I just needed to vent for once because no one I know here understands. To everyone I'm just dramatic and need to get over it because people have it worse off. And they do, but I can't help it! Honest I'm trying so hard and I just can't! I can't...
