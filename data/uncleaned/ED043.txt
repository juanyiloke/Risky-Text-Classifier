Do I?Hi, I don't even know if I have an ed or if im just trying to make excuses for myself. I eat almost constantly now, almost obsessively. I can't control myself.I used to make myself throw up, and after i binge I usually really want to, but I don't. Every day I wake up and tell myself that today I'm going to start a healthier life. I tell myself that I want to do it to be healthy, but I know that I'm truly doing it because I feel so fat. I'm tired of being ashamed of my reflection. I'm tired of feeling ugly and I'm tired of feeling like no one will love me. I'm obsessed with being skinny almost as much as I'm obsessed with eating. It's like my mind is at war with itself. Be skinny, eat more food, lose weight, eat until your sick. Maybe I'm just being a hypochondriac, but almost everyone in my family has some kind of addiction. Drugs, alcohol, cigarettes Is mine food? help
