My life sucks. . my relationship, money, and family life sucks. what to do!? help?2014-06-08, 09:19 AMIm 21 years old and my life is a mess and i don't know what to do. I don't have any real friends that's why Im on here for advice. First, my relationship sucks. My girlfriend. . Yes Im a bi sexual. She was wonderful at first. Now she's distant show no affection unless she wants it. Im in a financial rut and she hasn't even offered to help me. She helps everyone but me it seems. I can't pay my school fees to start school or pay my phone bill and she is the only one i talk to on it. But she still hasn't offered help. Im in the process of waiting for my new office job to start next month so Im broke. I use to be an exotic dancer for a few years so my self esteem is low. . Im very attractive but i feel worthless at times. My family is making my life hard also. My sister and my mom make me miserable and i live with them til i can afford to move on my own. I want so bad to start school and get my own place. And be in a healthy relationship with someone who loves me. I love my girlfriend she says she loves me too but i clearly see now that she doesn't. I don't wanna break up with her because she's like my only friend. I don't know what to do anymore. I know you don't know me or the whole situation. . . But some good advice please? Thanks
