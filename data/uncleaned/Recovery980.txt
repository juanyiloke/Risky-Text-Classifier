1 yearIt's a bit past the date, but I joined 08-03-2013. It's now 11-11-2014. Over a year ago I was sure my life would be over within days, and I stumbled across SF. Now I'm still depressed, very stressed, but happy. Just in the last week I've been in 3 states, seen my old friends, gone to the beach daily, played in the sea, got free clothes, food, and world class 'medicinal herbs' in the last month: I moved out, celebrated Halloween, got money. In the last 6 months: I made immense progress in my mood stability, nipped out some bad habits, accepted my self, and largely forgot about my last few exes. Since 14 months ago: I went through Hell, beat Hell, met some new people, changed out of my awful job, got close to my oldest friend, took 2 sweet vacations, met my baby Nieces, watched my nephew grow, dated x2 more, and got a golden chance to make my own life, far from my old one. I'm not particularly strong, I'm prone to lots of bad things, but I want to see my life in another year. For the first time really.
