Constant tingly anxiety feelingSince October I have had all sorts of anxiety-health anxiety, Pure O thoughts, existential anxiety, panic attacks. Currently I'm going through existential anxiety, deep thinking all sorts of things about life. It's really getting to me. A week ago I had the most severe panic attack, I felt like I was surely dying. Ever since then I feel anxious all the time, constantly tracking my breath, tingly feeling all over my body, butterflies in my stomach. I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack all day long. I don't know what to do...I don't know what to do anymore
