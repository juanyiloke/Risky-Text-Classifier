Afraid that I'm going to fail my first year of uni.by Wik1995So , Im living at home and studying at uni (its a hour commute one-way) with my parents paying for my tuition fees , so im afraid that if i fail i fail them and they will be angry and I dont know what to do if thats the case. so My exams start next week , all year I have been stressing alot (there where issues with my tuition fees , my dyslexia and my girlfriend who is on the other side of the country). So this means i have only handed in 3 out of 8 essays that I have had due , in 3 of my modules. Im not sure how uni is graded or what I need to get into the second year. so i geuss im asking if its possible to get in for my second year at this point? thanks
