anastrozole side effects after one tablet¥	I started taking Anastrozole last night, straight after my meal, and before I went to bed at 9.30pm my legs started hurting, they were red hot and restless, I also had a terrible headache and I still have it at 5am.  My affected breast going into my underarm was so painful, swelled up so much that I couldn't sleep. I took parcetomol but it didn't help. And although it was taken with a meal, I still feel nausious.¥	I'm thinking of not taking another one and ringing my BCN.¥	Anyone else had these symptoms?
