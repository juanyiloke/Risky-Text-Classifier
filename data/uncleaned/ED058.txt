I think I might have an eating disorderI am a young mother to three kids under four. I have been struggling with body issues since having my first, but since my middle child (2.5 years) has been born, I have struggled with food.I hide all of this from my husband - he has no idea. I am so ashamed, and I don't understand what's wrong with me. I will be screaming at myself in my head "Don't do this! Don't do this!", but I will anyway.Three months ago is when I first discovered that there was such a thing as binge eating disorder. Until then, it didn't even occur to me that I might have an eating disorder, I just thought I lacked self control. For the past couple of months, I've been trying my hardest to be aware and to fight it... but I can't. I am just so deeply ashamed. What is wrong with me that I put food ahead of my spouse and children? I am posting here because I plan to call the hotline number on Monday when they open, but I feel like I've just come to this realization, and I could really use some input from people who have been there/done that until Monday morning. I want to tell my husband, but I don't know how. I am so ashamed to even admit that this might be a possibility. Help!
