Messed first year upby embarrassmentso basically I feel as if I have underestimated uni a lot, I'm not someone who normally struggles academically and did do well in my a levels but when I started uni I made a lot of mistakes I missed an exam failed a piece of coursework and got in trouble for self plagiarism. So after first term I failed 3/4 modules but the thing is all work that I did complete I either got firsts or 2:1 so I wasn't necessarily struggling I was just very disorganised anyway after first term ended I got my act together and I am doing MUCH better but I cant help but think I'm too late and that I will probably fail first year due to first term, I really just wanna know if anyone has maybe failed a module and what happened to them, do I have a chance of going into second year?
