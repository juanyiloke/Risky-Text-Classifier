My struggle to gaining weightI'm 15 years old. I'm 5'2 and weigh approx. 97lbs as of today. I have never been able to gain a ton of weight. I've never weighed 100lbs. The past week and a half or so I have been doing all that I can to gain weight. I've grown to dislike my figure and how my body looks. I have this strange feelings planted in my mind that if I don't have "curves" then no guy is to ever find me sexy or attractive. I've pretty much shoved as much food as I can down my throat. Yesterday I weighed 99.7lbs and my goal is to get to 100 and then eventually 115. My problem is, that I think the changes in my eating habits, (not eating very often to eating 4 meals and 5-6 snack sessions a day) has been making me very sick and worrisome. Is it bad to change your eating habits so drastically in such a short amount of time? And is that possibly the cause to my sickness? Thank you for taking your time to read what I have to say.
