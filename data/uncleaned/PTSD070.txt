Autism And PtsdI was recently tested for autism, since I have a lot of difficulty discussing the trauma that led to my PTSD, and my psychiatrist at the time was not sure whether this was a character trait or a symptom. Long story short, I meet the DSM-V criteria for autism. However, my autism developed late. It didn't start until I was around 6 years old, which was also the age of my first Criterion A trauma.My psychiatrist took this as confirmation that my autism is not "real" autism and is actually an atypical coping mechanism for trauma. She encouraged me to undergo exposure therapy. I was reluctant to do this because:a) I was pushed into exposure therapy as a teenager, during my stint at a behavioral modification facility. It was a horrible experience. I'm not sure I'll ever recover from that.b) Everything I've read says that exposure therapy hasn't been the recommended treatment for the past 15 years or so. Some studies suggest it can do more harm, even when handled properly.I asked my psychiatrist for alternatives. After some evasiveness, she admitted she wasn't trained in any techniques *except* exposure. Then she dropped me as a patient. She claims not to know anyone who can help me, since both my PTSD and my autism are atypical in nature. I'm pretty upset about this. Life is unbearable, I cannot fix it myself, and apparently, there is no one who can help.Has anyone else heard of autism as an atypical coping reaction to trauma? Intense World Theory posits a link between the two but that's the only significant connection I can find.I'm starting to think that this psychiatrist was full of shit from the beginning. I feel like a fool for trusting her at all in the first place. My experience is that all mental health professionals lie, and all of them will hurt you. Don't believe them when they say they won't. They are lying.
