Blood pressure controlMy BP has begun to misbehave. It's swinging up and down seemingly at random, although my 'white coat syndrome' doesn't help. I've been put on the waiting list for a 24 hour monitor but wondered if anyone here has successfully dealt with hypertension via diet or supplements rather than taking a lot of medication. I've looked on the web but most of the diet advice I've found is the bog-standard NHS guidelines of cutting out fat and eating lots of complex carbs, which would ruin all the work I've done by low-carbing.  Does Co-Enzyme Q10 really work? What can I do in within a very low carb diet to control it? I've stopped using salt in the last few days but otherwise I'm at a loss to know what to do next. (This could be interesting though - I've had far more carb in the last few months than I should have done. This week I've stripped the carbs right back to where I started last year and it'll be interesting to see if my BP goes back down)
