I've got nothing to live for and I don't think I've ever had. Every time I ask for a help, people either ignore me or just don't care. The worst thing they'd do, though, is send a message, or several, then just leave me behind.Happens every single time. Nobody wants to help me. Maybe it's because they can't, or some other reason, but fact is still a fact. I'm alone. I want to die. I'm looking for a better way to do this and trying to set up a proper time. And I'm tired being all alone and dealing with emotional pain, which I can't even counter.
