Advice: Newly Diagnosed Type 2 in a wheelchair, what can I do?Hi everyone, so at 11:30 yesterday morning, my GP finally tells me that I am type 2, but not much else. Makes an appointment for me to see a nurse on Wednesday 10th Feb, 2016) and gives me some diastix (urine testing strips), telling me to go home and test myself at random once or twice a day.The GP also has changed one of my other medications because apparently it is loaded with sugar. The only thing the GP did say was that I needed to completely cut sugar and starches out of my diet, something which I will do, but am already finding there is sugar in things like the sugar free squash I use and in bread.What should I be entirely cutting out; what should I be avoiding, and what can I still eat?Also; any more general advice. I am in a wheelchair 24/7, so physical exercise is very limited.I am on a LOT of other medications (including a mixture of both liquid and long release morphine, at around 600 to 700mg per day.)I am on benefits and feel extremely lucky to be so, even if having tried working and volunteering in the past has left me in hospital, I'd still give my left arm to do it if I could. Unfortunately it's just not practical.So erm; I guess what I want is advice and help. I know virtually nothing and am kinda scared to eat anything now. But I know there are a lot of people who live with this condition and make it through the day. So I will be able to; I just need to be a bit more informed. That's all.Thanks in advance;Christopher.I am in a wheelchair and use a urine bottle, so testing this way is a lot easier than I would have thought it would be for most people. (#perksOfTheChair)But I must admit; I do not really know anything and there seems to be so much conflicting advice out there.
