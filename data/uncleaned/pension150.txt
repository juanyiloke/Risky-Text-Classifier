Scam Phone CallHi all I received a call today from a man who identified himself as being a representative of the software company "virtual pc doctor" He told me in a very strong Indian accent that they had detected that my computer had a virus on it and it was very important that I now go to my computer, while he talked me through the steps of how to remove it. I began to suspect something funny when he got very stroppy when i asked him to repeat what he had just told me. I then asked him to give me his name and phone number which he did then I told him I would call my internet supplier to check out that they had dealings with this company .Well!! he really got a strop on then and started to talk over me and shouting  “how would your internet provider be able to help you” it’s a software problem not an internet problem and that I really had a very bad infection much worse than any virus and it was going to knock out my computer. Basically I think he was trying to get me to open up remote assistance for him to get access I immediately bit his head off ( not literally of course)   and put the phone down on him.After hanging up on him I looked up "virtual pc doctor" on Google and a lot of scam reports came up. Just wondering if anyone else as received one of these calls.
