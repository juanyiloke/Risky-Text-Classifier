OlympicsThe increase in the budget for the opening and closing ceremony and security, announced today by the goverment (also known as con men). Seems to me to be the amount of heating allowance they took of us this winter, so while your sat shivering remember you paid your bit towards the olympics. And you can watch on t.v thats if your not dead.
