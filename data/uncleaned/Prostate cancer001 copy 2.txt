Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsyJust wanted to share my personal experience of this procedure. I had an option to getting this done over six months ago but opted for a MRI scan instead which came back all clear. However, my last PSA test two month ago showed it was still on the rise and my only option was a biopsy. Although I really didn't have to wait two months I decided to take my time because I wasn't looking forward to it! I had read about it being painful for some people and even had a second hand account from a friend of a friend who said it was the worse experience of his life! Had it done last Friday. Got to the hospital around 10am, was given antibiotics at 11.30am and had the procedure at 12.30pm. Yes, it is a very uncomfortable but not painful. I did find the noise when they were taking the sample a bit disconcerting though, sounds like a giant stapler. A word of CAUTION Ð it is recommended that you drink plenty of fluids afterwards. I drank gallons of water, close to 2 litres and although I managed to urinate before leaving the hospital, due the prostate becoming inflamed it took me another 3 hours before I could go again! This caused me a lot of panic because my bladder was full and wanted to urinate but nothing happened. I was in severe discomfort because of it for hours. So yes, do drink fluids but don't go overboard like I did! Good news is that there isn't any real pain afterwards, just a dull ache which went away after taking paracetamol. Blood in urine stopped after going twice and blood in stool disappeared after two days.
