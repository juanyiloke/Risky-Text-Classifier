I just want to be normalIve suffered depression and anxiety for years, I have good days and I have horrible days but lately there all horrible nothing makes it better, it's starting to affect my job because of my constant mood swings, my friends are sick of it and I don't blame them I wouldn't want to hang out with me either, I've tried everything and nothing has helped, I've been on so many different meds and they also have done nothing! I just want to feel happy and normal I don't even know what it feels like anymore to be happy it hurts to smile. No one ever listens to me they always just say I'm seeking attention or being a drama queen, I don't know what to do anymore, I can't even get out of bed somedays all I want to do is lay under my doona and cry! I'm not asking for help or anything at all really I just want to get it off my chest and for someone to listen to me, and ask does anyone else feel like this.
