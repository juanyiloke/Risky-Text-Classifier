common or notI don't do much night life I am too old A friend of my of similar vintage was telling about going to her nieces hen night which was all going really well until they were retuning to the hotel they were staying at, they were randomly attacked by some other girls/women the whole thing was very upsetting, anyway its apparently called a posh beating and it seems to consist of some "scumbag women" choosing to attack well spoken well dressed woman on nights out. The whole thing sounds so bizarre I was wondering if it a common or not.I know it silly but I am always more shocked by female violence.
