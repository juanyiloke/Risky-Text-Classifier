What has therapy done for you....I've been considering seeing a therapist for the last couple of years now as I know I have a couple issues that could do with being fixed. For too long I've thought "maybe if I keep a little diary" or "maybe if I just stay in this weekend and have a good think" I'll sort them out, but nope. No improvement. And I don't think there will likely be any improvement without the help of a professional.ÊMy issues revolve around being emotionally unavailable, cold and cutoff. It's only with some people too which makes it very strange. I can't quite explain why but a lot of people that know me, know I run hot and cold like a tap. It's not a nice way to be and I'd love to just be my warm and approachable self but.. all the time.ÊI would love to hear from any of the ladies on here who have seen someone (no mention of names, per charter) but to know how you got on? In my circle of friends talking about this kind of thing would be a no-go. But I would love to hear about to what extent people were able to sort through messy brains and just got to the root of whatever's going on and dealt with it. Did you change? Can people change? Or is it always an on-going struggle but you just need the right tools?
