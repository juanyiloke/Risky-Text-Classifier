union rep request denied________________________________________I'm writing to get info on this situation my brother is in,ill keep it short and sweet.He started a job 3 weeks ago (first job and is 21) in a well known supermarket,seemed to be getting on well, started with a few other lads but in the 3 weeks he was the only one to not get paid, he was told it was a problem on their part, that's fine.Anyways he turned up to work today and everyone kept telling him he was getting let go, he worked half his shift and was called into a meeting.At the meeting he was told it was a bad conversation that had to be had,he was given a weeks notice his contract was terminated, he immediately asked for a union rep to be present and was told none needed to be there, he replied "I pay for union rep out of the money i haven't even gotten paid yet for the last 3 weeks so I want one present" and they refused, and he asked again and was refused again. He also asked for the reason he was being let go and they weren't at liberty to say and he was to ask his line manager tomorrow, then was told "why are you sitting there still go back to work" Seems like a bad way to treat anyone but I'm pretty sure that he should of been allowed a union rep.what should he do??Also a good mate of mine works there and had text me to say he heard he got sacked, and that was an hour or two befor he was even brought in.
