I just began 30 mgs a day of Cymbalta and for some reason my DR lowered (I think by accident) my xanax from 2 mgs to .5 which is a HUGE jump. I take it only at night before sleep. It seems to ward off night terrors.ÊAnyways, I took my first dose yesterday and literally 30minutes I felt a difference. I felt a bit disconnected then after I forced myself to get motivated I had bursts of energy and almost a surreal feeling of happiness and content.ÊI slept well thanks to my xanax ( I still have 8 days left of 2 mgs) I woke up and took it today and felt just .... weird. Not bad just content and not anxious.ÊI have some energy that I didn't have before and I feel more rational. Now I know this isn't common to feel any effect this soon on a GAD med but I swear to god I do.Êi've tried SSRI"s n the past and they did not help what so ever. Thankfully there is now SNRI's and I hope this is what I've been needing. I have PTSD and GAD.ÊAnyone have any positive experiences with this med?
