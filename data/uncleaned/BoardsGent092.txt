Question for the boys - to pay or not to pay?Hi!I'm sure there are a million threads open already on this but looking for some male insight. I've recently started dated after getting out of LTR. My ex was pretty stingy and I paid for pretty much everything.ÊIf you are on a date with a girl for the first time would you expect to pay? Or would you have an issue if she didn't offer to pay for anything?I was on a date last night and it went really well and he paid, but afterwards I felt a little bit guilty. The girls think that it's normal, but what do the guys think?Thanks a Mil!
