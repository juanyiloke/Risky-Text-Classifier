Êeating disorder advice?hiya, im suffering from an eating disorder. I have my good days and bad days. I have been told I have bulimia but I dont binge. I eat less or normal amounts of food (depends) and purge regularly. on a good week, it can be once a week but on bad weeks, it can be numerous times every day. im not really sure what I have, ive looked at symptoms for both anorexia and bulimia and I have most of them. im struggling at the moment. my body is very weak and sometimes I find it difficult to walk, my hair has started to thin and fall out, I sometimes can bleed spontaneously and have really bad stomach pains regulary. I have very low self esteem and Im hardly ever feel hungry, my energy can drop very low instantly. I was just wondering if anyone else has suffered from some of these symptoms?? and what I need to do to overcome my bad days?? ive been getting better recently but last week, I relapsed and started purging again.
