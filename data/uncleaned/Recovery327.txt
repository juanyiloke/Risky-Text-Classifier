Light at the end of the tunnel **possible trigger*Hi everyone. I just wanted to share how things have been, so you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I have suffered with depression for many years, varying in severity. I have been on the brink of ending it, thinking everyone would be better without me. I have been on meds for nearly a year now, never missing and I have been having counselling, as well as talking to many people on here who have gotten me through some hard times.the past couple of weeks i really feel I have turned a corner. I am getting out and about, doing a lot of walking, without panic attacks. I am doing more now with my kids, than I have for years and losing weight in the process. I get up in the mornings now and actually care about how I look. I put my jewellery on and brush my hair and daft little things like that.Even when I had a bad day last week, I managed to get myself off the chair and went out for a walk with my daughter and felt much better for having coped with it.I know depression never really goes away and I know that I will still have bad days, but I have not felt this good in many years. There is no quick fix for depression. What will work for one person will be wrong for another. But if you can figure out what works for you, with help and support from family and friends and DWD of course, things can get better
