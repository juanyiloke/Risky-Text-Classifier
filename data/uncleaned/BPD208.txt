ÊWhat help is there?Feeling really bad at the moment. Well, that's not true - i'm not feeling anything at all and i'm also feeling everything.It's been no secret that I think the BPD label isn't accurate but hey ho, i'm stuck with it.I was so eager to appear 'good' and 'non-borderline' when I saw the pdoc Thursday that I withheld a lot about how bad i'm really feeling.Why has it got to be like this? Why does the BPD label mean you're on your own?Why is it not seen by a lot of professionals as a legitimate illness?There is no help. The crisis team play a dangerous game of reverse psychology when you say you're suicidal.Guidelines say that it's not good for people with BPD to go into hospital because they can get too used to being cared for. Like, god fucking forbid a Borderline should feel like a part of the human race and have their needs met for one second.I'm sick of the anxiety not being recognised.. the palpitations, the nightmares, the sweating, feeling like i'm going into some battle when I just need some milk from the shop.Right now i'm thinking fuck it, i'll just self-harm like is expected of me (even though it's been three years) because at least i'll feel something and get some fucked-up sense of accomplishment.I can't stand this loneliness, this exile, this "you've got to learn to soothe yourself", this living on an island that's cut off from the rest of humanity.(Offline) friends are fucking phonies. Family are fucked up. What's the fucking point in being here?ÊI can't bear the thought of another OD and being treated like human garbage in A&E, but I can't bear the thought of going on much longer either.
