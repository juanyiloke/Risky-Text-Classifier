Seretide Accuhaler Warning. I was diagnosed with COPD by the practice nurse. I was then called in by my GP and she prescribed a Seretide Accuhaler.....TWO Inhalations in the Morning and TWO Inhalations in the Evening.The only other medication I have ever been given for what they say is COPD is a Ventolin reliever.After three days of use of the Seretide Acculater I have stopped using it.It has made it very hard for me to speak.... I have to strain to talk, and has caused me to constantly clear my throat. AND, it had given me a bright red nose and red cheeks....look like Aunt Sally or a heavy drinker.I have had few of the problems associated in the diagnosis of COPD, I can walk for 10 miles or more without being breathless, if I walk up a steep hill then I may be puffing a bit but then I am back to normal.I am going to dispute the diagnosis of COPD with my doctor, I am 62 years old, just a little overweight 14st 9lbs 6ft 1\&quot; tall and maybe a bit unfit but otherwise in reasonable health.Be very careful in taking this medicine and read up on the side effects which can be very serious.
