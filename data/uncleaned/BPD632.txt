I Have Borderline Personality DisorderBorderline Are Extremely Intelligence And Creative.ÊBorderline are extremely intelligence and creative. We struggle to create and give birth to ourselves through our work and intellectual pursuit instead of mundane (...) normal people standards. Everyday, Every Night, we splinted and twisted into multiple personalities that disagree or try to overlap the previous one.The anxiety and worry are all delusions, the pain is real. if we hurt someone under our psychosis. it's definitely our fault for not re-think our thinking or not wrestle it hard enough when 'it' comes. When the anxious came, we can deny it access to rape our thought and feeling, always remember that. We're narcissistic and perfectionist lot, the best way to enjoy borderline is built principality and commitment and forget the rest of the entire world as they are all nothing but we're the center of everything.Try learning other language like mandarin, Japanese, Korean, France or Russian, You'll be amaze how easy borderline patient capability in learning multiple linguist than a normal people. It also filled up the senseless Identity crisis. Put those 'demonic narrator' and 'alter ego' where it belongs instead of condemning us, every night or every time whenever we feel weak. Let them try speak mandarin, it'll shut them up.Remember, we're not a bunch of irritable *******, at the opposite we're a perfect lover, a genius who are extremely good at what we do. But Let's be honest that we're a freak. Sometimes other people, (...) especially the weak and pathetic people dump their problems on us!Not our problem.We have No Enemy.Be Happy, Be creative, Be different, Be powerful, Be Smart.Remember to stay calm and stay full, always think but don't let our mind brooding on idleness.Peace & Cheers to all my BPD Brothers and sisters.
