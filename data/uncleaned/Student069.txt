Uni - Need some advice? :(by Laura249Ok, so I started uni at UCL in September 2013 but in April 2014 l had to take a year out due to depression and I am due back to sit my exams in 2 weeks I had to fill in a form and medical note 2 wks ago to say I was fit to go back but the thing is I don't think I am I'm still anxious and depressed and i haven't slept in 2 days, can barely function and cant even face revision or exams and I just don't know what to do?What makes it harder is my course is quite unique so its not like I can just re-apply and do a different course and this is one of the only ones in the UK.I was ill like this during A-level so my Alevels took me 3 years and Ive already had a yr out and feel like I should have got myself sorted and Im worried if I don't pass this year then I don't know what would happen.Any advice welcome
