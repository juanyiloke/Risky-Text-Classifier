Constant hypos and obsessively testingSo although the Constant Glucose Monitoring came dislodged, one thing it had shown me is that I seem to average 3 Hypos a day. Yes, that's not a typo. 3 hypos a day. Now I'm testing obsessively because I can't believe I kept missing them. I'm testing every hour at least. Well, while tutoring today I did a test. 2.1. And I didnt feel a thing. Felt absolutely fine with no symtoms what so ever. Last night I had a really bad one where I was actually fitting according to Hubby. I'm feeling a little down about my diabetes at the moment. I feel like I just can't get it right. I'm either high or hypo.
