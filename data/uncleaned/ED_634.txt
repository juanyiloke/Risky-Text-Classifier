Would me ED team tell me?So the thing is my mom has a bad tember and kind of gets a kick out of yelling at people. On bad days i have said to her that recovery didnt work and i didnt care for my treatment and such things. Not so nice things, i do have to admit.ÊNow i am really scared that she has called them and told them what i have said. And complained about my treatment cause it would be really typical of her and i know she hates that i am still ill. I asked her yesterday and my father and they seemed to freeze and panic quite a bit. They said no but i dont believe them. If i asked my team, do you think they would answear me?
