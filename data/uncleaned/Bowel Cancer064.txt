Scan results - 8 weeks into chemoHello all,Following a lovely lot of good news mixed with some very sad I am giving a little glittery update.....I had a scan recently ahead of my 4th chemo as they had found nodules on my lungs in the initial diagnosis back on Nov 8th.....so back then they flagged them up and said they would keep an eye on them.I realised when she told me the results that I could hold my breath for a long time as kept waiting for a 'but'. The fab news is that my nodules have remained exactly the same she so she thinks it highly unlikely that they are connected to my cancer and most likely scar tissue as they originally thought. I do have to say I have never been so happy to have scar tissue! No more scans now until after my 12th chemo due on 21st July not that the date is set in my mind! Just finished number 5 this week so nearly half way  Positive thoughts and a shed load of determination as always,Glitterbug
