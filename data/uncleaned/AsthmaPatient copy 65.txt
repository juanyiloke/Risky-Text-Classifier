Clenil Modulite 100 Really interesting to read all your thoughts on this drug.My son had recurrent chest infections 2/3 yrs ago and as a result developed asthma (albeit about 6 different doctors debated whether or not he did actually have it!) Does appear to be quite mild in form BUT also suffers from hayfever and other allergies so has not been great since March this year due to tree and grass pollen being bad.However, as a result of now religiously taking his brown inhaler morning and night he's put on about a stone in 6 mths! Really puffy cheeks and very rounded belly. Why is weight gain not listed as a side effect on the paperwork?! Will be looking to get in at the docs asap as he doesnt each lots of sweets/junk food/fizzy pop and we each relatively healthy family meals. But he does seem hungry all the time. And being a 9 year old he gets plenty of exercise as he never sits still!Was beginning to think I was a bad parent seeing him this tubby but I may have found the reason why.
