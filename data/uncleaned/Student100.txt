Having second thoughts about starting uni this year?by ayybethI've got into all the uni's I wanted and I've been so sure that this is what I want for so long, but now I'm wondering if I really want to start my course next year. I feel like I'm rushing a bit, and I'm scared that I'll go straight from school to uni to work and never actually live my life. It feels like my life's just beginning now, I've got myself a job and a boyfriend and I'm getting a car and it just seems like I'll be giving all of that up for university. I do still want to go to uni I'm just wondering about deferring my place, would it be worth it? We're you ever in this position? What did you do?Edit: and the fact that all my friends are going to uni is scary too, what if I end up friendless? And I see them all having fun at uni and I'm just stuck at home (with a family I don't like). I feel like if I went, I'd be going for the wrong reasons. And I can't afford to just move out either so that's not an option!
