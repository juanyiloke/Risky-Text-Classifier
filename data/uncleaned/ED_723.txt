Ashamed. Advice please?This is really hard for me to write. I have been away from here for quite a while, just lurking...doing ok I suppose. I somehow managed to get into my third year at uni, I quit my job to make it easier to study and I have thrown myself into my assignments trying my absolute hardest. I haven't purged for a long long time now and that is a huge step for me, after many years of it, I have (I think) finally recovered (??)...can I say that yet? But I am now really struggling with my unhealthy eating and weight gain....well I think and feel like I have gained weight, I haven't weighed myself for months and have no access to scales so don't actually know. I don't wish to know my weight as that will trigger me but I feel horrid.I haven't been exercising as much as I normally would due to not working and not riding my horse as much, I don't have time with all the uni work and I can feel the difference. I'm really struggling with my body image, self esteem and controlling my unhealthy eating habits. I am eating crap, rather than nutritious meals partly due to lack of time and eating on the go, partly due to lack of money and partly because I am being lazy. I feel so ashamed, I feel so disgusting and cant stand looking in the mirror. Please can I have some support or words of advise? I don't want to fall back into bad habits but I don't want to gain anymore weight. Lots of love and thankyou in advance, Gemz xx
