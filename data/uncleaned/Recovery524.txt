  Nervous/Excited for the FutureI've been on this site for years just coming and going as I need, but this is the first year I've felt that things are turning around for the better. I'm trying to do so much, and I never thought I would make it to where I am in life  now. This time last year or two years ago seems like a lifetime away, and I've done a lot of things over the last two years. Today I got a call back  from a local volunteer ambulance service, and next week I'm going to be able to volunteer. I'm so nervous, but really excited I can start doing this. Its something I've been wanting to do for a while. In a couple of months, I'll have my EMT certification and will be able to do even more to help .I'm just happy because this is the first time in my life I've felt I've had a realistic plan, and I'm excited because my plan involves something I really want to do. It's also the first time in my life I'm confident I'll be good at something. Sometimes I'm so happy things have finally been turning around. I'm so thankful for the opportunities I have now that I've never been given in the past. I just want this confidence, good opportunities, and learningexperiences  to keep snowballing until I've finally become the person I've always  wanted to be.
