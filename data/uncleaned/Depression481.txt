No One True AnswerÊ  Laylian ,Ê25 Apr 2015"go with the flow" "let go" "take control' "decide for yourself"ÊYou see phrases like those above used often when people are trying to cope or help others cope with depression.Ê Pick the phrase that fits the moment and it works but if you look at them all they really do contradict each other.Ê So maybe the idea is not the live your life by any one concept but by them all.Ê In other words, give control to someone else when you want to and keep it for yourself when you want to, go with the flow or think it thru as appropriate for the moment.ÊThe ultimate responsibility is ours.Ê We decide when to go with the flow or take control.Ê There is no one way.ÊAnyway, that is where my mind rambled when I got the shower today.Ê Does it spark any thoughts in others?
