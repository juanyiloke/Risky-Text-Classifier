Manchester vs York Uni?by jessicamblandI've been offered a place at both the Universities of Manchester and York to study French with Linguistics, and I've done hours of research and discussing and asking advice and I am so completely torn between the two.Basically, I love that Manchester has so much to do and offer and I'm quite into events and gigs and of course there are so many venues there. I think the actual campus is nice, the nightlife is good (I hope?) and it has great shopping.On the other hand, I've been to York many times and love how small and beautiful it is, whereas I am less familiar with Manchester and I'm worried I might feel a little lost. I know York is a better Uni from the rankings but I don't really want to base it on just this. I'm just not sure which place would be best to live in because I like dislike things about both.So, can any students of either University tell me what it's like to live there, pros/cons and whether you would recommend it? Also what accommodation you live/lived in first year. Thank you!
