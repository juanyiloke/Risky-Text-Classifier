Feeling very fed up¥	Hi all. I know that in the scheme of things my day hasn't been all that bad just very frustrating. I thought I was starting rads today so hubbie and I went to the hospital all ready for the final step. To cut a long story short the only who didn't know it had been cancelled was me! It turned out that my notes were in a pile marked "patient not contacted"!!! I have a new start date of the 14th. my onco told that my rads would start 3-4 weeks after chemo, IF it starts next week it will be more than 8 weeks. I haven't cried over much but I did today
