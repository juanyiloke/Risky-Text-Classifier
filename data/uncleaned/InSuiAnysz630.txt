What I would do, what I would give not to cuddle with just any random person but with that one special person. Unfortunately, I've come to understand that person doesn't exist for me. I've been so lonely that I've thought about even dating a guy. Have you ever felt that lonely? That something you know you don't like you would do anyway just to feel wanted, loved, accepted... It's a shame that we as a people have to settle for less always in order to just feel like life is even worth it. I'm so tired of being depressed, used even... I remember a time in my life where I wasn't so depressed, I was being used and it felt just fine. Now I can be used but I don't get the emotional feed back to reassure me I'm doing a good job. It hurts so much inside it makes me want to die. No one will ever make me feel good about myself. People tell me that I can't be happy until I'm happy with myself, it's not true though. I get my happiness from giving, providing and receiving love in return. I miss the feelings of affection, being held, being told about how much of a good guy I'am. To be held in my lover's arms, kissed and told "I love you, you mean so much to me." Amazing how something so simple was enough to make me feel like I was the greatest man on Earth and made me feel like there was nothing I wouldn't do to make that woman's dreams come true. Now I find it a struggle to get up and do things for myself. The joy came from knowing that everything she ever wanted I could give and it made me feel secure in her love. Now I can't even do for myself, the will to do the things I need to do to become a better person. I feel so empty now... So alone...
