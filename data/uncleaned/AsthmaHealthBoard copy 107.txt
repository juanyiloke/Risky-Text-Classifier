Is this Asthma or Something Else - No Help From Doctors!________________________________________Since I was pregnant with my daughter (5 years ago) I have had non-stop chest and sinus infections. It was a time of huge stress while I was pregnant(family member died) and also other intense stress since. I had very bad heartburn while pregnant and up til recently (didnt respond to Nexium or other PPI) until I began a strict diet eliminating all foods I react to.My GP says it might be asthma,but my PFT test are good (actually I have 110% lung capacity) and the reversability was 8% or something like that which apparently doesnt mean I have asthma? I do have an audible wheeze and it is worse after I eat certain foods so I thought I have Gerd or LPR, but scope showed nothing and PPI didnt work (well helped the cough a little but no relief from the bronchitis). Taking an inhaler does help with the breathlessness when I get bronchitis but is doing nothing to prevent it.I am every 6 weeks taking an antibiotic (due to illness with coughing up yellow/green mucus and breathlessness) and my stomach is destroyed as a result. I think from all the antibiotics I have destroyed my stomach and cant digest a lot of foods. Or maybe I have food allergies that are causing the heartburn and wheeze ???I have a I've been doing an elimination diet and so far these are the foods that cause me heartburn and half an hour later I wheeze
