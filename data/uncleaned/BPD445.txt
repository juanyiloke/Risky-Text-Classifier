ÊI hate animals... am I alone in this?I always have. I have a few, I am not abusive but I do not like them, they belong to my children and husband. I constantly wish they were gone, I HATE taking care of them, no one else does, I always end up cleaning up after them and I can't stand them, they are filthy ridiculous creatures and I think domesticating them was selfish and weird... I know this is not a natural trait, I hate them all for some reason, no I was not attacked by an animal, a racoon once, it was scary but I don't hate racoons. Wild animals are great, seeing them in their habitat is a wonderful thing, I enjoy zoos from time to time. My fav animals if I have to say are primates and turtles. I own 2 red-eared sliders. They leave me alone I leave them alone, they look cute when they eat and I only have to clean their tank every couple weeks. Other people's animals annoy me terribly. When I go visit them I avoid their animals... I have to fake kindness... and it is hard... it's like there is some kind of block between me and them. I am studying Zen Buddhism right now and I am actively trying to spend time with both my cats, both whom I haven't touched for months. To open up that side of me if it exists. I am trying! To see if I can train myself to like them, to see what everyone sees in them. I do not understand when people get all worked up about pets. I just truly do not understand, I am not being rude or anything I just do not get it. Has anyone experienced this?Ê
