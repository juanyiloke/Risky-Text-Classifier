Being a godmother how special is it to you?Are any of ye ladies a godmother to a child and if so how do ye like it?Êive had my godson (11) up with me for his yearly trip to me a weekend. He lives 2 hours away from me so only get to have him up once a year really. Cherish our days together and is a break of me and husband's routine. We don't have any kids and prob won't have any id say so guess ive always had that special bond with my godson.ÊI was just asked last night to be an honoury godmother to a little girl who's godmother passed away 2 weeks ago. it was my husband's best friend (who i would be close to) and his wife that had asked me. im thrilled to be asked. their little girl is just 18 months and is gorgeous and even though i haven't seen much of her she was great with me at her aunts funeral last week.ÊDoes anyone think their should be a limited number of godchildren a person can have? The two kids im godparents to now are friends as my two bro's still have no kids even though that is about to change next year as we got the news my sil is due in jan. I decided i would be godmother to one of my bro's kids if i am ever asked and that would be it for me.
