Hobbies and past timesI used to be involved with a few car clubs and motor events, going to track days, shows or races on the regular. But as the group got older and kids and marriages got in the way it all slowed down a bit. While I still enjoy it all, I don't get involved in the event organisation any more and rarely get out on track these days. But still, I've met some of my best friends through it all.Then a few years ago myself and some friends were talking about how great it was going fishing as a kid and we decided there and then to start doing it again. We bought all the gear again and spent a year or so out fishing 2/3 times a week. The hobby started to just fade away with bad weather conditions and the glaring fact that there seems to be no fish worth catching on the east coast of Ireland any more.There's always been the usual few pints and maybe catch a rugby match but hobby wise, fast forward and in the last 7-8 months we've been out golfing every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend if it's decent out, and during a discussion about planning an upcoming stag party someone said "Lets go golfing in Portugal", and that's when the penny dropped... we're getting old!I couldn't help but bring up the fishing, and now the golfing and said "What's next lads?", and apart from the usual 'coke n hookers' stuff everyone just thought about it for a minute and we decided to just try and stick to the golf for as long we can.So lads, what do you do in your spare time?
