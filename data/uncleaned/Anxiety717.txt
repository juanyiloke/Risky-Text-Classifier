REALLY BAD job interview anxietyHey guys!My anxiety has been much more controllable since I stopped taking Klonopin. Its been a year this month since I've been benzo free! On a less positive note, it's also been a year this month since I've been employed...I quit my job last year because I was unable to function without the Klonopin. Some very dark months followed.Anyways, I've been looking for a job for months. I got an interview a few weeks ago but was a nervous WRECK in the HR office. The employer asked me for my ID / SS card and I was visibly trembling when I got out my wallet. My voice was cracking, I was probably taking deep breaths and I wouldn't be surprised if he thought I was having a heart attack right then and there (although he didnt say anything)Needless to say, I didn't get the job. And that really frustrated me, but I continued looking.I just got a phone call today from a company that sounds really interested in me. From what I can tell, I'm overqualified so they are very persistent in keeping in contact with me. When I answered their call today, my voice started shaking again and I felt like I was having trouble breathing. I'm excited for this job, so I am really frustrated that my body is interpreting my excitement as danger and creating physical symptoms as a result of fear.I think they are going to invite me for an interview very soon - within the next few days. What can I do to reduce physical symptoms while I'm in the hot seat? I feel like I am there mentally. It's the shaking and speaking difficulties that really get to me. I have some valerian root and L-theanine, but am not 100% sure if I should take that due to my low blood pressure. What do you guys think? Any advice? I'm about to go for a little jog to clear my mind a bit. That usually seems to help. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
