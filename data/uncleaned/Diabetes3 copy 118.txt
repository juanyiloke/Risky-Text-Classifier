Ageing and neuropathyI was (mis)diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in March 2011 but became unwell and was losing weight until I was correctly diagnosed with Type 1 in January 2012. During those 9 months my stores of muscle and fat were depleted and now aged 53 I look much older than I should. I find it hard to tone up as I have a chronic back condition too. It sounds shallow to be distressed by such a cosmetic thing but I've always looked after my health and now, because of my horrible sallow face - it's how the DSN instantly diagnosed me - I am self-conscious and keen to stay home more than go out. Today I saw an old friend whose first comment was that I 'hadn't aged well.'I guess my question is this: I am seriously thinking about cosmetic surgery but have sensitive tingly skin and wonder if anyone on the forum has had such a procedure and whether they would recommend it. Thanks.
