ÊI think my mind is deteriotingHey I'm new to this forum, but I was diagnosed with schitzophrenia (or schitzo affective depending on the doctor) in 2001. I've relasped a bunch of times, but have been fine on my meds these past 4 or 5 years. A month ago I started to feel more abnormal than usual. None of the schitzo effects but more concious of my interactions with people. I'm a bike messenger in SF and can only talk to customers for 20 seconds without it getting weird. Maybe I'm percieving into too much of their facial expressions or maybe I'm tripping. I also feel that people are more rude to me than usual. I'm also an introverted loner with really no freinds and who doesn't make freinds. My girl broke up with me a month and a half ago which was my last real freind, so I really have no one to help me focus and be a positive support system right now. I also have low EQ. Sorry to bug yall with my problems but I don't feel 100% right now.
