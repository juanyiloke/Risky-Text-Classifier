 2 hour commute to uni (Pgs: 1 2 3)by l'insegnanteI'm just wondering if anyone has lived at home during uni and travelled a 2 hour commute to university from their home? I'd like to know what it's like as I hate the halls at my uni and getting a house isn't an option. By bus my uni is 2 hours (give or take depending on traffic etc) from my house. for my course id be in uni 3 days a week during semester one and 3-5 days a week during semesters 2 and 3. Also I'd rather live at home during my placements and living at home full time would mean my uni would have no choice but to place me at home - so that's a factor into my thinking also.
