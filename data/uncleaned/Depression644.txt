ComfortStarted by ElizabethJane1?, 06-03-15 01:02 PMI'm not exactly depressed at the moment but I have been very very busy. I have been thinking that I haven't had much 'me' time lately. I have been aware that I want something or someone to comfort me. I know that some one will say oh but you are married. Unfortunately I don't have that sort of relationship with OH any more. It isn't just physical comfort snuggling under the duvet with someone. I enjoy food and music which are other forms of comfort. Although the weather is getting warmer I am still feeling cold so warmth is another form of comfort. I try no to snooze too much but snoozing is another form of comfort. I have friends who I talk to on the Internet but sometimes if they can't talk now it feels like some sort of rejection. Maybe I just need a few days off or a holiday ?
