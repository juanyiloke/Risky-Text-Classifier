Sexual Abuse Or Fear?It's taken me 16 years (my age now) to realize that I am an abuse victim. My father is a deeply damaged gambling addict with anger issues who has always verbally berated and threatened my mother, brother, and me. My earliest memory is one in which he picked me up when I didn't want to be picked up, so I flailed around, knocking his glasses off. He exploded in anger and yelled at me until I sobbed and was too scared to come out of the corner of the room. The few other memories I have are similar, and so I know deep in my heart that my fear of my father is legitimate. But something happened a year ago when my PTSD symptoms really started showing. Every time he would come near me, I'd stiffen or jump or get irritable. I'd immediately feel terribly sick and dreadful. The thing is, this happened right after I read Dylan Farrow's heartbreaking account of the sexual abuse she endured from her father, Woody Allen. Suddenly, I became very conscious of any mention of SA in media or otherwise. I'd think, "this is me!" even though I don't have any really solid memories of SA. I started reading incest erotica because I was drawn to it for some reason. It sickens me and I'm so ashamed, but it's the truth. I'm constantly telling myself that I'm making this up, that I'm just trying to justify how terrible I feel by making my life story darker. Sometimes I feel like I have no right to call myself an abide victim because I was "only" yelled at. But there's still a small, strong voice in me that says, "you were SA". I just have no memory and I feel like a fraud. I'm too scared to talk to my therapist about this because I'd feel like a liar. Please help.
