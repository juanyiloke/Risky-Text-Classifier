Suit FabricsHi GuysI am considering getting my wedding suits made abroad rather than renting. I do not want the normal wedding attire and want smart and stylish 3-piece suits.ÊI am looking to know about fabrics. I understand a suit made of 100% wool in excess of super 120s is a well made suit but there is a big difference on price across different sellers. Given its only for the one day I do not particularly care what a suit is made of as long as I like it.ÊCan someone with knowledge in the area give me a run down on suit fabrics?Thanks
