Reference issues - what to do?2012-06-25, 09:50 PMI am looking for some advice or experience in issues with references.ÊI just had a second interview for a Marketing Manager role with a large consumer packaged goods company. This may be the last interview. If offered the position, I will be asked for references, but I have some issues with this....1) I have had some performance issues with the company that I have been with for the last four years. My last reviews wasn`t great and I am concerned that my boss won`t give me a good reference, especially since this position would be a promotion. I do have a reference with my last employer, but my current employer is a more important reference. Any suggesions on how to do deal with this2) the director that I just interviewed with knows a couple of my co-workers at my current company. I`m worried that she will follow up with them and they will not give me the greatest recommendation.Any thoughts on how to deal with these issuesThanks,
