Be good while I'm awayJust popping over to Florida for a couple of weeks, so you must all behave while I'm away.I've laid some plans for eating the right things and hope to join the happy walkers exercising along the sands of the Gulf coast before breakfast (too hot afterwards). I've ordered the diabetic food on the flight out to see what they come up with, and if it's no better for me than the conventional diet I won't bother on the way back. I have back-up snacks which are customs friendly.My HbA1c is 48 again, so I'm going along nice and steadily, and thank you for your timely advice about LCHF, otherwise my BS would probably have been zooming upwards by now.I have a date with the doctor next month when I plan to ask if I can officially come off statins for a while.Keep doing whatever works for you
