Getting frustrated by my asthma ]Hello!I've had asthma all my life. It was really bad when I was younger but got better, but now it all seems to be getting worse since going to uni. Over the last 2 years I keep getting more and increasingly more serious asthma attacks and even ended up in hospital 2 weeks ago for a few days. In the last 12 months I've had 3 chest infections and been on a course of Prednisolone about 6 times. I'm on symbicort 400mcg 4 times day, zarfirlukast 20mg twice a day and certizine 10mg a day (and obviously ventilation as and when I require it). I was on bambuterol 10mg but this got discontinued 2 weeks ago. It just I'm getting rather fed up now. I did have a respiratory referral however ended up in hospital a day before my appointment, so it became more about treating my exacerbation rather than long-term management. Now I have to wait for my asthma nurse appointment at the hospital for another 4 weeks as this was her soonest appointment. I'm been advised against working, going out to the pub, nightclubs etc. (which is hard because my flatmates go out all the time and now I just get depressed because I feel like I'm missing out) and also doing exercise including swimming (which, again, is hard for me because I'm a rather active person when my asthma is good). I just feel really frustrated because I don't feel like anyone is doing anything and they're just waiting for another exacerbation to treat instead. Its not helped by the fact I can't even do simple things like go swimming and have to sit bored at home instead, which is just adding to my frustration. Does anyone have advice?
