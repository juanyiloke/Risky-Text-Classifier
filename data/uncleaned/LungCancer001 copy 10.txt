new member to this siteI used to come to this site in 2013 to read the posts on bladder cancer as my husband fought his battle. I lost the love of my life in just a year from start to finish. I found so much information and could relate to so many stories. but now I find I am here for me. I have nsclc and it is inoperable. stage III A. I have had 33 radiation treatments and 4 chemo (carbo and Taxol) the tumor has shrunk from 3.7 to 1.3 I am now taking carbo and alimta at 3 week intervals. I have not experience any difficulty with the exception on energy level about zero. I still eat any thing I want, but the coughing spells are awful. I guess I just needed to say these words out loud, I have wonderful support from family but I find attitude and laughter seems to help me the most. my heart and prayers go out to all members who have suffered from this terrible disease.
