ScaredI do not know what to feel because I just recently developed anorexia a few months ago and my parents and coaches quickly discovered it and talked to me about it. I am currently going to therapy and am seeing a nutritionist, on my parents request, and I want to get better because I am miserable, but at the same time I am so scared. I almost don't want it to go away and to be solved because I am terrified of what will happen to me if I just give in and eat and do what everyone else is asking me to do. I know that this is bad for me and I am harming myself, but I don't want this to just get better. I don't want to ever have a desire for food or eating again and I am just frustrated because I see both sides of the needing to get better and not wanting to so clearly.
