"Settling" in a relationshipGoing unreg for this as a few people in real life know my username. I wanted to start a discussion on the notion of “settling” in a relationship and peoples’ experience of this. I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, due to my own circumstances. I’m recently out of a long-term relationship. My boyfriend of 3 years ended things and while this was extremely upsetting for me, as well as now facing the daunting prospect of single life in my 30’s, I know this was for the best. This is because, if I’m honest, I was never 100% sure of our relationship. Don’t get me wrong, I was happy with him, but deep down, I always had a niggling doubt that maybe he wasn’t the right man for me. That maybe there was someone else out there I would love more. The sad thing is that I didn’t listen to those doubts. Turned out, he recently developed the same kind of doubts but the difference was, he had the guts to end things.Upon reflection, I have decided that I will never again settle in a relationship. I would love the whole marriage/kids thing but only with someone I am 100% sure about. But then I got to thinking, how common is it for people to settle for less than they want and deserve. Obviously the whole ticking of the biological clock may have a huge part to play in this. So have you ever settled in a relationship? Or how common do you think this is? Or is it possible to ever really be 100% certain about a relationship (I’m really hoping for affirmation of this)?
