In a fogI am in a fog I am on the site often I post occasionally and I communicated with some quite often privately. Here is the thing right now I am falling with no safety nets as it were. I am scared, tired, and sad of yet another thing I must process in my brain. I have used a lot of things in my toolkit as of late and nothing seems to be helping. My therapist needs to go out of town for awhile not sure of return time. This morning in a email she stated " I need you to stay strong for me. Dig into your toolkit you can do this." Honestly not sure I can do this anymore it took me over two hours to get out of bed this morning I felt paralyzed basically. I really do want to quit but know I can't. Interesting thought in my brain today: Does it take courage to be a coward or am I coward because I have no courage? I am just so confused right now...Ê
