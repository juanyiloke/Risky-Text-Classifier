Question about chemoI have been through a lot the past year. The latest is a diagnosis of stage 2 squamous cell lung cancer. Had part of lung removed, 5 lymph nodes tested (all negative). Currently trying to do chemo as a preventative measure, but 2 treatments and off for 3 weeks due to an infection, then started up again last Friday. I feel like crap, had run to ER last night for temp of 102.7 (couldn't find a reason for it). I'm tired all the time and having a terrible time with constipation. Starting to wonder if chemo is worth it??? I was also told I have mild emphysema. Any incite/advice would be very gratefully appreciated.
