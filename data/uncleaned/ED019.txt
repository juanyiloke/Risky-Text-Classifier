I need helpMy weight issue started in secondary school I was overweight and was a victim of bullying. I moved to England at 16 years old were I lived with my auntie who made sure I ate properly I managed to loose weight. I can't remember having a problem at that stage it all started at 18 when I moved out on my own - I gained a lot of weight again. It started by skipping meals - I eventually lost a lot of weight. By the time I was 21 the laxatives took over my life. I started showing symptoms of an ED - and my family clicked on.I'm now 25 and it's been going on for years I've been to the doctors about it I've been in hospital about it being extreamly underweight I did quite well after coming out of hospital gaining a healthy weight.it flared up again with my mum finding out about the laxatives dragging me to the doctors I've been assessed by Eatting disorder people who don't seem to think I have a problem. My life is set out In a routine. I work 3 days on and 3 off. Some days I will restrict whereas other days I will come home and binge. But I can never sleep properly, which leaves me with no energy and feeling poorly with a bad headache and find it hard to get on with my work.My mood is always up and down and I push my close ones away if they mention anything about my Eatting or my ways. I become very angry and sad, and it has caused me to loose all my friends because of not wanting to go out. And comes between my relationships causing things not to work out. My weight is constantly up and down.
