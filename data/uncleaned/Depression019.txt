MIND and Marathon! Hi guys, how are you all doing? I've not been here for a while I have been up and down but slowly getting there got my exercise and healthy eating regime going!For the past few months I have been working for MIND (the mental health charity! An amazing charity that has been a huge part of my recovery I suggest that you take a look at their website and see what they have to offer I'm your area I work at a drop in centre in my area and its a great place for people suffering with MH issues to get out the house and socialise in a non judgemental environment!Next month my boyfriend is running the Edinburgh marathon to raise money for mind, unfortuatly he hasn't had many sponsors yet  I'm not aloud to post the link for his just giving page but please PM me if you are interested in making a donation however big or small it would mean s much to us and it would be going to a great charity! :DThanks for taking the time to read thisJen x
