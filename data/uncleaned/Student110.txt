I feel like a loser being old at university :(by FuzzyOttersHiI'm a university student at a great uni on a good course. But I feel really bad about it, I'm four years older than everyone else. I lost two years due to changing university degrees (and changing university). I lost another two years due to illness. I don't feel it's my fault I'm older, but I'm still feel ashamed by it.I feel really ashamed being older than everyone else, I'll be 27 when I finally graduate.I've never had a proper job, nor a settled relationship. A lot of mature students whilst at university, are at a certain stage at their personal life. For me, it just feels as if I am four years older than my peers, but have nothing to show for it. I'm just older.I'm scared of graduating so late, this isn't how I pictured it. I'm worried by the time I graduate, I would have lost my looks, might have even lost my hair which terrifies me. I imagined that I would find a family and settle down after I graduated, but now I feel scared and pressurised, I'll already be closer to 30 when I finally graduate. I feel I've just wasted valuable years of my life already.I want to get over it. But I can't seem to. I just feel pathetic.Any advice? And would you mind if you were in the same position and how would you deal with it if it was you?
