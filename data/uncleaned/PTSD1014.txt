I am a veteran who suffers from PTSD. The myriad of medications that I am on are staggering, and one day I got to thinking I cant find happiness in a bottle, so I quit 2000mg of Depakote, 300mg of Zoloft and 1 mg. of Klonopin cold turkey. Lets just say Im not myself. I have been off work for about two weeks, and do not feel safe to return. The Doctor put me back on my medications, and will see me again in a month. If I still dont feel like returning, is that bad? How long does this last? Since quitting all of this, I have been irritable, depressed, anxious, fatigued and have lost all interest in doing anything.
