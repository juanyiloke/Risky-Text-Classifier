Not sure where to start really. I'm 30, in the military, went to Afghanistan but I don't think i derive my anger from there. I saw a therapist and felt like they did nothing for me. Said I had sub-clinical PTSD then basically said she did all she could for me. Side bar - I had a car bomb go off about 30 feet from me, I ended up with a concussion and was told that my black out spells which showed up about 2 months after the IED were actually partial/complex seizures. I'm taking some meds for that which stopped the blackouts/seizures. This was all diagnosed follow several more episodes once I was back home. Back to my anger. Once I got home from Afghanistan, the littlest thing would set me off. Forgetting my wallet when the sole purpose of me leaving the house would make me go ballistic. If I misplaced something in the house I would tear the house apart just looking for it. I can identify when I'm angry, I sometimes I know its irrational but I can't stop the feeling and I can't hide the expression in my face and voice. How do I control myself. The therapist said my "file cabinets" were full and I just needed to purge them. Then my memory would improve and anger would decrease. Its been 4 years since I got back, I'm married with an 18 month old daughter. I'm great with my daughter but my relationship with my wife is so strained I'd say its not even there any more. I find she's not supportive but then look at things again and think she is, then its the opposite again. Our relationship or lack there of seems to make her unable to console me, which I understand but at the same time how do I get better so that I can make my relationship better. I don't want to lose my family.
