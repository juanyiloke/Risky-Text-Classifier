Dealing with it all so far except for this; tips welcome!Hi All,this is a question mainly for those of you who are going through or have been through cancer with infant children at home.I was blessed 15 months ago with a beautiful daughter; my first child. I left having kids to fairly late in life and it has been an utter joy every day.Now with this disease suddenly intruding, I'm really at a loss.Without trying to pose or be overly stoic, I find I have been able to deal with almost every aspect of it pretty well - even easily.The one thing I simply can't get my head around is the very real possibility of leaving my little girl without a dad, and (selfishly perhaps) the crushing sadness of thinking about not knowing her as she grows. Actually, I can't even think about it, it's too bigHas anyone found a way to deal with this?I suppose I could ask a professional counsellor, but I'm afraid that the responses would all sound like platitudes.I'm more interested in ANY thoughts you have found useful to calm/comfort yourself in a similar situtation; practical ones, bizarre ones, whatever.Thanks
