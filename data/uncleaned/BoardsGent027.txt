Family Mediation ServiceHi lads,Have any of ye experience of the Family Mediation Service? From my research it is primarily staffed by women. Anecdotally, my local FMS office is all female staff and, a few men I spoke with who have been through it felt that there was an element of bias in favour of the female spouse.I am due to attend in next two weeks and am wondering whether to avail of it or try for a private mediator somewhere or else leave it go through the courts.Any experiences to think about would be most welcome. Thanks.
