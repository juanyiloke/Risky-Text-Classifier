CEA and MRIHi I realise the nurses are not on here until the 2nd jan so wondered if anyone has any thoughts on my question.It is three years since my bowel cancer treatments ( grade 3 and non reversible stoma) and I have just had a letter saying my blood markers are up and to have them repeated in 3 months., they haven't said how high - is this normal? I am having an MRI scan in January for my chronic back and leg pains ( this is not a referral from the bowel cancer clinic but from my physio) - I was just wondering if when they read these scans they will be able to see if there is any cancer present? Thank you for taking time to read this stef  successful colonoscopyHIjust wanted to share my news. I have just had my colonoscopy and been told that I don't need another for 5 years - i must admit i watched it on the screen ( yes i'm a bit odd I prefer not to have the anesthetic) and it was really clearThe surgeon explained Mondays CT results and said all was clear- but since coming out I remember him saying there were 2 ...not sure what he said on the liver but nothing to be bothered about- anyone any idea what he said?How do I get a copy of the report?thanksstef
