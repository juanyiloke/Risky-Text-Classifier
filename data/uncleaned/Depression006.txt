i cant believe it.Posted a day ago kyaroru90463So just when I thought when things were going marginally alright,got out of deprdepression i think,has been a stressful few weeks,I lose my job.happened about an hour ago,and I was able to go and meet up with my mum at her work and still here.though im relieved to have left,it's come at the worst possible time with uni finishing in two and a half weeks.I'm scared my depression will come back because of this,and having had to not go to class in the afternoon when they started to enforce no fixed days off a few weeks ago.in the last few days I have been feeling like i was waiting for something bad to happen and here it is.I see my pwp next Wednesday and know i can contact the mental health crisis team if nessicary,but im scared.update. So finally seeing someone on Wednesday.still having trouble sleeping,and still have alot of stress,anxiety and indecision,but the depression has mostly gone,but still feel down at times.still havent come to terms with all the changchanges in my life,and have another life desicion to make in the next few weeks,but have the help in place thanks to doing previous things leading up to this point.has anyone else had phycyratist appointments and what should i expect from it? Also a thank you to the people who have commented and helped keep me going with your help and support,as this has been something i could turn to and i dont know what i would have done without you
