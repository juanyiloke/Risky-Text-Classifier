Buying new carRetiring in January.Wanting to part exchange car prior to retirement ,need to add £6,000 to pay outright for car ..dont want hire purchase when retired.Been told by a friend we cant do this at this stage in our life ...all money we have now must not be spent but kept .We will not be requiring housing benefits etc but ofcourse spending £6,000 will put us nearer needing help over the years as and when savings are below the limit.Can it be true that we cant use this money now to ensure we have a decent vehicle for the rest of our days ??What a way to live if this is correct ,we spent nothing on holidays or anything much and the car is almost 5 years old so it made sense to us to replace it while we can .
