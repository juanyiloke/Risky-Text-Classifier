Advice neededHello I am new here and this is my first posting so please treat me gently!  Can anyone give me some advice, I am shortly to be made redundant, I work for a local college and we have only been offered statuary redundancy payment.  I am nearly 59 therefore have to accept my options for gaining another position with a decent salary is limited, I want to ask management if they would be willing to pay my local government pension up till I can draw my state pension which is about 3 years (age 62.5).  In your expert opinion what is the likelyhood of my wish being granted or would I just be wasting my time asking?Thanks in anticipation.
