I guess its time to ask for help.I dont really know where to start or what to ask. I guess im struggling with food more than i like to admit.The past year has been difficult in regards of food. Ive improved my life in many ways but relapsed into my ed about a year ago. It came sneaking back in with physical illness and being ill and i didnt realise what was happening until it was too late.ÊI had gained a ton on meds and had become rather overweight. I was very unhappy about that but determined not to lose weight like i had every other time in my life. Unfortunately it went exactly like it has always done and i stopped eating. Ive lost all the weight and recently found out my bmi is now in the anorexic range again. I know with my health issues etc. I cant afford to lose more but no matter how much i try to eat, my weight keep dropping.ÊIm in an unhappy place atm. This is a bad month for me, very bad after trauma and it is especially related to my body. That means i really cannot face gaining. But im scared. My physical health is very bad atm at it seems i dont realise i have to eat until im about to pass out. Normally i need encouragment to do it still. My boyfriend would normally be the one to do that but today we broke up. I never eat when on my own. I dont know how to manage this.I feel so overwhelmed and sad and this has taken over my life again. I dont know how to cope besides not eating. I dont know how to get through.ÊI dont know what im asking. I just feel terribly alone and sad and overwhelmed by life right now. I cant face any of it. I dont know who to ask for help. I dont want to admit how out of control this has gotten, i dont want to get as ill as i used to be either.ÊI have no idea where to turn but here. Im sorry.
