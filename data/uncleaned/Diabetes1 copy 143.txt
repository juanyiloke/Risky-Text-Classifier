I need your help...Hello everybody,I want to briefly introduce myself, and ask you for your help on something.I am Bastiaan Franssen, born in the Netherlands, 27 years old and 26 years type 1 diabetic patient. At the moment, I'm studying Health Informatics at the Swedish Karolinska Medical University. Health informatics is a rather new field in which we try to incorporate IT technology in the various settings of medical care. In the last year of our program we need to do a master thesis in the field of medical informatics, and I've chosen to pick a subject that is personally related to me as well. Diabetes.Diabetes has been a great drive for me, instead of seeing it as a burden, I'm trying to use my knowledge in IT to make a difference for other patients suffering of diabetes out there. That's why I started going to med-school. My thesis is focusing on the integration of MOOC (massive open online courses, such as Coursea, edx, etc) into the education of diabetics. That's why I would love to ask patients all over the world whether they could participate in a survey about their needs and expectations of a educational system based on MOOC.I was wondering, could you please help me with this by filling in this questionnaire:http://goo.gl/forms/cVbbkWgJiR. The survey takes about 10 - 15 minutes and is fully anonymous. Your help with be of an tremendous support in my thesis, and perhaps your input could help me develop an educational platform for everyone who needs to get proper education on their disease, whenever and however they want.Cheers and thank you for considering helping me,Bastiaan Franssen
