Smell of Cigarette Smoke In Unit  7  I have been having issues with cigarette smells coming into my unit. The smell is coming from my next door neighbour who happens to be the building supers. They just moved in a few months ago and ever since I have been smelling cigarettes. I am extremely sensitive to the smell, my mom smoked when pregnant with me (it was the 80's and normal  ) and also in the house when growing up. My asthma is pretty bad. So here I am pretty much trapped smelling cigarettes. I have complained to the manager of the surrounding buildings and he asked the supers to get an air filter. They said they didn't want to give up smoking indoors. Well the filter is doing nothing at all and I am feeling like poop. Run down and exhausted. I have also been having other health issues that seem to be a mystery. The manager suggested I transfer to a new unit which involves me signing a new one year lease, and also doesn't guarentee that I will get away from the smell of cigarettes. I will also have to change my address on a lot of documentation, etc. I just needed to vent. Smokers have the right to smoke in their unit even if it makes others ill.
