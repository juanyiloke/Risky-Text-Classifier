Starting to give up:( Hello everyone and hope your asthma is treating you well and you're in a stable condition at the moment.However im on the verge of giving up as im not getting better and now the doctors have told me they have nothing else they can do and im just going to live with it, well its fine for you to give up but i have to keep going. But i dont want to wake up everday having to have a nebuliser and not being able to breathe theres no quality of life in that and not being able to go to school or socialize with my friends because im stuck in bed all day everyday struggling to breathe.And my life has changed completely i just wasnt who i used to be, I didnt use to look at myself in the mirror and breakdown because i look like a chipmunk (thanks pred), i didnt use to refuse to eat meals or even refuse mc donalds like i do now. I just wish i could be back to my old self from two years ago where i was happy and not depressed because of my medical condition.Crying over asthma is probably pathetic in your eyes but its the only way i can get my true feelings out without upsetting my family,I feel so alone and just need some support from who understands what im going through.Sorry for this rant :(Bryony (16)
