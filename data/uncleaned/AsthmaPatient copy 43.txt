Asthma at 56  11  I have has a severe coght since January, my gp sent me for a chest xray in April and the a camera down my throat at the end of April. Nothing sinister was noted. The secialist said it may be acid reflux so as i am already on a strong acid reflux tablet that was that. The cough and weeezing has been getting progressively worse, so yesterday i went back to the GP as neither my husband or self have not been getting much sleep. The coughing is now constant. My GP has now precsribed me two inhalers to use for the next 8 weeks to see if this clears i up. Is the normal thing try it and see or should i be taking some sort of test to see if it is asthma.I hope someone can hel me as i do not know what else to do.Manythanks
