My Histology Report I had a PSA test in May 2014 which was recorded at 8.9. A subsequent 12 core biopsy tested positive with 4 cores positive on one side only. Graded Gleason 7 (3+4) and staged T2b. MRI scan showed nothing of interest. Had radical prostatectomy in August and now, 2 months later I am recovered and feeling good.Just got the histology report and the consultant said that I am now clear.I am not so sure because of what I read in the histology report.I have pasted the report below. Can anyone see anything that I should be worried about ?
