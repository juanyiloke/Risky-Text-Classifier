is it asthma?________________________________________Hi, I am new and was hoping u's could give me some advice about my son i'll give you a little bit of my son's background it might help...my son is 16mths old was born 11 wks premature was ventilated for 7 days & 100% oxygen for 8 wks he had a bowel resection he has gerd, suck & swallow difficulties, lactose intolerant, gastrostomy (tube fed) although he does eat just not very much & he has failure to thrive (not surprising) he has always been a noisy breather especially when having a bottle he couldn't co-ordinate the suck swallow breathe but the problem is he got a cold/flu which he had for 6 wks & since then his breathing is worse he constantly sounds congested as though he needs to do a good cough to get phlegm up. He does cough a lot especially whilst playing & he can cough so much that he is sick which his breathing temporary improves on a night he will cough, snore, wheeze (well its more like a crackle/garggly sound & in the morning he is particullary bad most mornings he will cough so much he either brings frothy phlegm up or is sick. I did take him to the doctors when he still had the cold & the doc said his chest was clear but she prescribed a steroid nasal spray & a inhaler (the blue one) these seem to work for a while at least allow him to drink some bottle does this sound like asthma? he can't talk yet so don't know if he experiences anymore symptoms
