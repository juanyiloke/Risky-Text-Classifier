where do we stand then?Legally?Following on from http://diabetes-support.org.uk/diabetesforum/index.php/topic,5263.0.htmlinsulin users do not have to test every time they get behind the wheel if it is a short trip. Only before the first trip , and every two hours whilst driving.my car/van can hold about 5hrs of petrol/diesel. the van can go further than the car so it could be a longer trip, so in theory i can go further for longer in the van and not have to test. Now if i get my basal wrong in the morning and have done some strenuous turning of the steering wheel when my power steering has packed in i could be likely to hypo, but i broke it up into 1hr 50 min sections. if i wanted to be really pedantic, are the dvla insisting that we test whilst driving? Its illegal to use a mobile phone whilst driving but apparently its ok to get strips out, insert them into a machine, stab etc etc..... I can just see the insurance forms now.I wonder if there is a law against testing while driving? the form does say
