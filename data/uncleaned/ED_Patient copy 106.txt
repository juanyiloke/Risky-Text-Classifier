AdviceI was referred to the eating disorder clininc and attended my first appointment today which was 1.5 hrs of questions. I have binged and made myself sick on and off for 15 years now but just lately is the worst its ever been. I have in the past done the cambridge diet (which is no food at all) and lost lots of weight and then put back on since Christmas I have put on 4 stone and am really suffering which is why I went for help! Well at the appointment she said I think you will benefit from a 6 week course of binge eating group therapy, now I dont actually agree with this firstly my job wont allow me 3 hrs off each week for 6 weeks secondly its not local and I just think I need more, what are your thoughts?
