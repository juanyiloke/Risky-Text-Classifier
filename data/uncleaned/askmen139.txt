Advice Needed2012-02-13, 07:16 PMI am a 31 yr old man, married with a child. I re-enrolled in college and am 1 yr out from getting my BS in Business, and going to grab a minor in Communications while Im at it. I have been having some fears if this hard work is going to pay off, I am currently working full time and going to school full time while taking care of my family. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to put myself in the best position to give me an extra edge over the competition.
