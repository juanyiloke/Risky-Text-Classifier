Intermittent fasting for Diabetes management: voodoo medicine or magic bullet?Anyone familiar with Dr. Jason Fung and his program of intermittent fasting for Diabetes management? He claims that it can actually reverse the course of the disease by improving the body’s insulin resistance. I recently learned of it, but am not fully convinced that it's a sound approach that can do what Dr. Fung claims. I’m still reading and researching, though what I’ve seen so far has me a bit intrigued. I’m actually considering giving it a try and blogging about my results athttp://damnyoudiabetes.com/. Any feedback regarding intermittent fasting or my blog is very much welcomed.
