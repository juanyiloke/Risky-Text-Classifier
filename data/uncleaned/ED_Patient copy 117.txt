Welcome to my \&quot;wonderful\&quot; life!I'm bulimic.I've been builimic for 24 years (over half of my life!).I went on to develop bulimia after suffering from anorexia, which I still very occassionally relapse into.I think the longest time I have managed to be bulimic free is probably 6-8 months. When I was pregnant my bulimia became manic, espescially in my 2nd &amp; 3rd trimester. Thankfully my child was born healthy, but the ammount of guilt that I still carry is unbelievable (even 15 years on). Thankfully my child is a very rounded, happy &amp; together individual.I find relationships extremely difficult to form (whether platonic or physical), I can't allow anyone to get close, I live under the pretence that I'm just too busy to fit it in. I'm not daft, I'm repulsed by myself &amp; fear rejection (abusused past &amp; not the perfect 'dolly' my mother expected!).I'm having an immense self-hatered day today, I feel chunky, ugly &amp; worthless (so bad was unable to go out the door), but I'm trying to break the binge &amp; puke cycle AGAIN! So I have it to go through until I'm back on the straight &amp; narrow. The only probem now is trying to avoid relapsing back into anorexia, as I'm trying to control my eating so not to binge!I desperatley want to get off this visious rounderbout &amp; one day I WILL be free of my eating dissorders. The daftest thing is 24 years on &amp; nobody still has a clue. Children are precious, protect them, listen to them, support them but most importantly allow them to develop into the people that they are - not who you expect them to be x
