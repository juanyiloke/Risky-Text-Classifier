Overcharging for Electricity on Economy 7 TarrifI had a new electricity meter installed several weeks ago which now requires me to scroll through a menu for readings.Ê Part of the menu includes the clock and I noticed that the time was set for GMT and not BST which meant the clock was 1 hour slow.Ê ÊAs I set most of my appliances to come on at midnight eg washing machine I thought I would be getting night rate charges, whereas because of wrong clock setting I was in fact still paying day rate charges.Ê ÊI contacted my electric company who advised that all time clocks for every electric supplier are permanently set at GMT so for 6 months of the year the time is out by 1 hour.Ê ÊWhen I complained to thenm (Atlantic, Electric nd Gas trading name for Scottish and Southern Energy) they immediately gave me a £20 credit.Ê When I asked for £20 for previous 3 years they initially refused until I told them I was going to watchdog and Ombudsman.Ê They immediately gave me a further £60 credit making £80 in all.Ê ÊSo if you are on an economy 7 tarif get onto your electicity compaany and demand a similar credit for every year you have been with the company.Ê Also do like I did and contact Watchdog.Ê I am now £80 bettef off than I would have been.Ê It is time to claim your refund - don't delay - check your clock setting today before clocks go back to GMT
