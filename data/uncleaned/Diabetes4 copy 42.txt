Thanks to DSF from Dr David CavanThis morning in the post I received a signed copy of "Reverse your Diabetes" written by Dr David Cavan.   I don't know if anyone remembers, but a year or so back he did request people's low carb stories and he has used them as part of his research for the book.  On page 273 "acknowledgements" he mentions the members of this forum who helped him and we are listed in "helpful websites".  We are mentioned in tandem with diabetes.co.uk, but since they funded the publication I think we can be generous and live with that don't you?     I've only flipped through it a bit so far, but it does look like interesting reading.  If you're thinking of buying it then please do so through our shop (link above) and generate a few pence for the forum upkeep
