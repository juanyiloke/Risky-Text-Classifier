Bladder cancer as well I'm just getting used to dealing with my prostate cancer when something else crops up. You will see from the update of my profile that I had blood in my urine on 9th December and a cystoscopy on 23rd December confirmed bladder cancer. So now I have to deal with a forthcoming operation to resection my bladder which will also give me the staging and grading of my bladder cancer. I was expecting to start radiotherapy on my prostate soon but I don't know now what is going to happen. If the bladder cancer turns out to be invasive the treatment is either surgery or radiotherapy. Surgery would involve removal of the bladder and creation of a urostomy but I'm not sure that they would do that because of my heart failure. So it might end up being radiotherapy. I wonder if I could have radiotherapy 2 for the price of 1 (prostate and bladder)!!! It's not always easy.
