I need a McVitie's Chocolate Digestive!I have such a craving just now for a McVities Chocolate Digestive, one or ten would do, it's just as well there are none in the house or I would scoff the lot.I don't understand this as my wife has a big bar of Dairy Milk in the fridge, but, that just won't cut it, I don't want it. (Plus, I like my cojones as they are   she'd remove them with a blunt knife if I touched her chocolate  ).One digestive would do, I'm not greedy (aye right, not much  ) Anyhoo, what I want to know is, why does it hurt so much to be good?
