How to reduce penis sensitivitygoing anonymous for obvious reasons. Im uncircumcised and have sensitivity around the tip of my penis for as long as i can remember. Posting this here as i'm pretty sure it doesn't constitute as medical advice..it usually gets extremely sensitive just below the head where the foreskin gets pulled back. I am wondering if there are any other guys who also experiences and knows of any way to reduce this?
