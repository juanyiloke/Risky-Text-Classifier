How to have a Successful Relationship with a BPDby khemix » Sun Mar 10, 2013 8:03 pmI think the only way to have a BPD relationship work is to make it open. Or rather, half open, as only the BPD is allowed to see other people. If the other person sees others the BPD will get jealous and the relationship will not work. The BPD needs attention from other men (or women) and will get it regardless. By being open to this and not judging their behavior the BPD will not run away or be ashamed. It's like masturbation and religion where unnecessary guilt results in depression.This may seem one sided but you should know at the onset that this is the life style that suits someone with BPD. On their part, the BPD must tell their partner who they are seeing and the other partner should be supportive. No secrets should be kept. This would result in trust between the two parties and a healthy and nourishing relationship would result. The alternative is to try to mold the BPD into something she is not which will only result in her feeling controlled and running away. By letting her cool off once in a while and not castigating her for infidelity she will see her partner as unconditionally loving her and will return the love in turn.So the price of dating a BPD? She gets to be physical with other men. The reward? A love so deep it will be addicting. I base this opinion on extensive reading, knowing many individuals with personality disorders, and studying the dynamics of those with successful relationships with a BPD partner.
