  Just wanted to say.I was really having a god-awful couple of days, not even my boyfriend could cheer me up for too long... but I'm glad to say I'm out of the funk, and all it took was 45 minutes on Skype.Just a message to those of you out there who are feeling low... talk to someone who you can just laugh with, genuinely laugh, because sometimes it can change your whole mood. A little laughter really is the best medicine... tonight proved it.Hope you all had a great day, and have a fantastic tomorrow
