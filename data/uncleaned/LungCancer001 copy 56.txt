HiI've been reading many of your stories over the past month and thought I should quit being a voyeur and share mine. I had a bronch last August for an abnormal CT scan. (I've had pneumonia a few times). Dr. said bronch OK. No cancer. Just mucus plug. Fast forward to Feb. I get a bill in the mail for genetic testing done on biopsy tissue samples. Huh? My primary pulls path notes and finds probable positive for adeno. Get appt with medical onc right away who says get new scans due to time period. So another CT and PET. Follow up with her and hear well..... maybe.... c/w.... blah blah. Go to acedemic center. So I do. Med onc up there says yes diffuse cancer in left lung. Need more tissue for treatment options. Back to local onc that now sends report saying stage IV and that I know probably not curable. Biopsy for mutations. I don't remember having that conversation with anyone. The last thing I knew was they weren't sure if it's cancer vs inflammation. Now she's got my stage IV? Next biopsy is 4-14. Meanwhile no treatment? I am so confused. Also my husband and brother were with me and are also confused. Are we just not understanding? Or do they talk in vagueness on purpose? I have a call into the cancer center today. My brother is calling the local medical onc today. I admire every one of you for being able to not only function but to comfort and be there for each other. One year ago this month my father was fighting lung cancer and lost his battle in May. My poor mother. UGH!
