Two types of insulin at the same timeI have been on Lantus for 4 years now.  Constantly increasing the dosage.A Dr suggested that I start Novolog as a companion to the Lantus.I get one is long and the other is short acting. What I do not understand is why use the two.  Asked the Dr and got an answer that I basically figured it was something she had been lead to believe was a good thing.  I am holding my own with the numbers, taken three times a day. A1C is down to 6.9, steady decline. What concerns me is I am close to 200 units a day (both of them) that is a lot by any standard. Soon I will be on Medicare and Insulin is a Tier 3 drug and sometimes higher.  One plan I looked into was $5K for two 3 month periods for just Lantus (donut hole in the coverages). So what is the deal with two kinds of insulin?  Coverage/consistancy ya I get that. Seems to me I could do the same thing with Lantus taking a shot more often in the day.I am looking into R-500 insulin and it is the same Tier and oddly enough almost the same cost per day. Dosage would be a lot less.
