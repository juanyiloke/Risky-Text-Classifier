Does anyone else's DCs suffer badly with teething? We get it so badly in our house...streaming noses, coughing at night, so so so so much dribble, vile nappies, chomping on everything in sight...oh and now hugely disrupted sleep even after calpol! Entirely my fault with the sleep as know that nurofen is far superior for teething pain. I am like a zombie today though and still no sign of these molars apart from big bumps under the gum!Please reassure me that you have similar experiences?!
