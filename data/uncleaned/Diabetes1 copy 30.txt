very strange!!!Yesterday hubby and I decided to go out to the pub to watch the match, and as he has been such a good boy lately and has been toeing the line with his diet, I thought a couple of pints wouldnt hurt him. Well 6 pints and 5 hours later we head home,its about 5.30, about 7.30 he says he doesnt feel too good, ha ha, I think that will teach you to be a pig,bet your blood sugars through the roof! bBut noo! in fact its 3.8!!!! How did that happen?????
