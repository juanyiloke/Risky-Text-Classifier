Does it ever get easier?I'm not sure if I'm going about this the right way, but I've hit rock bottom and I need to get better. I'm a collegiate runner and my body won't be able to take this much longer. I can't take it mentally anymore either. It started almost two years ago when I started restricting my calories and doing extra workouts in an effort to get faster. Once I started to see results, I spiraled out of control. My periods stopped. I got a stress fracture. I gained all the weight back and then some. I couldn't control my desire to eat and I started to binge and purge. I lost the weight again but I still can't seem to stop.I was sitting on the floor in my bathroom earlier tonight and I realized how terrible I felt after I was done and how this wasn't worth it. Frankly, it sucks. I've been telling myself for a month that this is the last time, but I can't seem to make it past two or three days. I want to stop. I need to stop. I'm terrified of someone finding out and what this is doing to me.I just need to know, does it get easier?
