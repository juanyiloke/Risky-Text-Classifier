Self criticismHi again... I have some background information about my current situation a day ago.These past few days have been extremely tough for me. I've been trying as hard as I can to be positive and provide a positive body image for myself, but nothing has been working out for me...I'm afraid that I might relapse any time now, and that means all my attempted progress would go to waste. Lately, I've been feeling so triggered; and by anything, it seems like.What are ways that help you maintain a decent body image?
