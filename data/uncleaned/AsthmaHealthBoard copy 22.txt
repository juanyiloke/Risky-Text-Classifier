Do I actually even have asthma???________________________________________For a lot of my life I've always experienced a problem with feeling like I can't get enough air in. I've never had an asthma attack exactly or wheezed or had any typical asthmatic symptoms, but basically sometimes I get in these body moods where when I breathe in, it feels like my lungs aren't getting in a full breath of air. So I keep taking deep breaths until I feel like I get a satisfactory breath that feels full and complete, and then as soon as I do that I'm back to feeling like I can't breathe properly.Several months ago I decided to visit a pulmonary doctor to see if I could possibly have asthma. He diagnosed me with asthma and put me on a daily inhaler for 2x a day (don't remember what that one was) which caused me to START wheezing, so then he switched me over to Advair. I feel almost like being on Advair has made the problem worse (not to mention it gave me thrush) so I went to the doctor a few days ago and my brand new doctor completely took me off of a daily inhaler and told me to use a rescue one if needed.I believe today is the second day without the daily inhaler and today I've experienced wheezing, something I NEVER experienced pre-asthma diagnosis. I'm also sick with I'm not sure what (my normal doctor said it was sinuses although I'm afraid it's maybe bronchitis), so I guess the wheezing could be a result of that. But I've been sick with whatever this is for the past week and today is the first day wheezing has been a problem.After dealing with it on and off all day I decided to use my rescue inhaler and the wheezing is mostly gone, but if I take a deep breath I can still feel it a little bit.Just wondering if anybody can shed any light on my situation, whether we have the same breathing problems or if an inhaler has caused any of this for you also?
