PTSD in publicby vmars » Sun Apr 27, 2014 7:15 amI hate having PTSD triggers while I'm in public because I become overwhelmingly upset very quickly and it's hard to avoid the flood of memories and feelings. Today in the natural family planning class I had to take with my fiance to get married I ended up getting triggered badly and I had to leave the room because I couldn't hold back the urge to cry. I couldn't go back to the class. I feel embarrassed that I can get triggered so easily out of nowhere. I feel like I should just be able to control it.
