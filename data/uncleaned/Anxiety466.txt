fixing "catastrophic" thinkingLately, since my anxiety has come back full force, I've noticed that I've been catastrophizing a lot, especially about relationship issues. If me and my best friend/ boyfriend have a fight, I think it means the end. If we like a different type of music or he thinks a show I watch is corny, I see it as an incompatibility that threatens our being together.This thought pattern that's developed in me lately started with studying and school issues - If I don't remain second in the class, I won't get into a good school. If I fail one test or get below an 86, I won't remain second. If I don't get into a good school I'm a failure. If I don't study for 8 hours I won't do well and then I'll feel guilty and regret it forever.ÊI don't know how to stop this thinking. I'll admit, most of the time I can tell that the thinking pattern is irrational. However, the jittery feelings of extreme anxiety are there even when I notice my pattern of thinking. What can I do?Ê
