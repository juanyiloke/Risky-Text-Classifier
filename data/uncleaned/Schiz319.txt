I looked up lead poisoning from lead fishing weights last night and found out that I could have developed a sz vulnerable brain from chewing on those small pea sized lead "split shot" fishing weights (an environmental factor), for I used to fish when I was a kid using them and would be chewing on them a lot when I was out fishing and getting hungry. I don't think they even new of lead paint in older building as being poisonous yet so no one had warned us about it. I know it's too late to prevent any brain damage incurred but I'm going to mention it to my doctor anyway.
