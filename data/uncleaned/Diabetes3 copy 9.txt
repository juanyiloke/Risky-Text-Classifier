Feeling poorlyI have been lucky not to have a lot of illness in my adult life. Currently I have the most appalling cold and cough and feel absolutely awful. Blood sugar levels are not good and I ache everywhere and I am running a high temperature. I don't want to eat, but have been forcing myself to drink. Is this just an ordinary cold and is the D making me feel so rough? Can I expect this every time I get a cold? Is it worth taking Robitussin for the cough? Most cold/flu things have sugar in them. Would lemon juice with sugar substitute be ok to help to break up the phlegm? Sorry to moan but I am a poorly dog today   and wanted to hear from people who know.
