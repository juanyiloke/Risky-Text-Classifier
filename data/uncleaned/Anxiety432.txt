Freaking out and terrified :(Does anyone else get this?Super tired, lay down to go to sleep, dozing off, 20-30 minutes pass, hard thump in chest or throat, can't breathe, heart rate quickens, headache comes, nausea, calm yourself down, headache gone, try to lay down again, feels like your heart can't work well when you lay down...like it's thumping hard and in your throat for a few seconds...afraid of it all happening again....Can anyone relate?Because I'm terrified And I've been to the ER numerous times and as recent as a little over a week ago...but, I've honestly never had it happen this way to me.I keep thinking that there has to be something wrong with my heart.The horrifying thoughts won't stop...:'( Christina
