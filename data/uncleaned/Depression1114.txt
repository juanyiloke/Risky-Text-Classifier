Feelings & Social InteractionsWhy is it that whenever I say something, whether written or spoke, and I don't get the exact response that I expected (or wanted?) I have this feeling of having offended that person, or that I have said something totally idiotic? ÊHas this to do with my mental illness or is it something else altogether? ÊAny thoughts from anyone?K
