Ready for itI think its time for me to die. The more i try the less i get. I juggle with my feelings so i wouldnt pass my feelings on other people that i know in person, i try so hard around them and what do i get from it? I get nothing absolutely nothing. Its not that i am trying to be nice to them so they would be nice to me, i am doing it coz thats me, i like helping, i like talking i like being with people. Why is it so hard to get that from other person? Why is it so god damn hard to care about someone? Why is it hard to care? I do my best, i really do, but i am alone. And even people that i consider my friends dont think of me to be that. I give my all to everyone i care about and they cant find enough decency in themselves to say simple fucking "hi" to me. Am i really that bad? And on top of it, that person who didnt even said "hi" to me today, person who i consider my "bestie" fucking said that i am the one who doesnt care! I am just hurt, i really am. On top of it we had a lesson today about enjoying life, how we should love our parents despite everything. They fucking beat me and hurt me, i have nightmares from them. They are ruining my every aspect of life every day. ANd i realized one thing, no matter how everyone treated me, i am the one to blame for it. I allowed it and i am allowing myself to suffer from it. I am my own enemy. I want to die so bad, and now the holiday season started, its the time i will spend fully alone, coz no one cares about me. I want to die so badly, since my life wont get better
