 On A Nicer Note ..... I'm reading through the pages here, from 17 till I get up to date. Just read a post where someone's Therapist cried, during the session.  Not sure where I'd go with that, myself. There it is though. They're human too .....When I got mine, (PTSD) the GP they sent out to take a look at me was human. She was also a few years younger than me. And, quite frankly, bloody nice looking!I'm happy to report though that, due to the state I was in, and my respect for the nature of our relationship, I never allowed the  factor to rear its head.I just quietly appreciated the fact that spending five minutes across the desk from her was somewhat more rewarding than looking at a sixty year old man. She was nice to look at. And her manner was nice too. Yeah; I really liked her Then, one day, I'm turning up for my latest appointment. I was just walking across the surgery car park. Lovely, sunny day. When, a little, red, open topped sports car came whizzing in and shot past me.There she was, Cath' (As I'd heard her colleagues call her). Young. Attractive. Long hair streaming in the wind. And I couldn't quite believe it when she cheerily called out; " Hullo, Darling! " Less than ten minutes later, behind her desk? She was the consummate Professional. Watching. Listening. Nodding. I was her patient.But, I swear to god; I'll raise a smile, on my death bed, looking back to that quite stunningly beautiful moment. When my ~ off duty ~ Doctor just flashed me that breath taking little snap shot glimpse of her own humanity.Doc; I swear to god: That was one of the most treasured moments of my entire life
