Hypo aftermathI have had a really weird afternoon which has unsettled me. I had to go out this morning and got home about 12.40pm, my Continuous Glucose Monitor was showing 4.2 with double downward arrows which means my glucose level is dropping rapidly. I tested my blood glucose and the meter showed 2.0 so I retested and got 2.0 again. I haven't got any hypo awareness so I wasn't shaking and felt normal. I sat down at the table and had some glucose drink then the next thing I knew I came round/woke up an hour later. I was in on my own so no one to ask what happened.I can't imagine I fell asleep as I wasn't in the least bit tired and am thinking my glucose dropped too low before the Lucozade kicked in. Really frightening and I'm so glad I'd managed to get some glucose in me before zoning out. Diabetes can be such a scary beast  The irony is my legs have been shaking ever since-through fright I think.Have any of you had a hypo experience where you just can't quite work out what happened?
