anxiety  14    I am 19 and I have been suffering with anxiety since I can remember, but it seemed to be very mild compared to what I'm feeling now, I am constantly dizzy, not just dizzy spells I mean dizzy all day everyday to the point I don't feel real and the room is spinning, I'm so unbalenced I find myself falling into things, I have abnormal panic attacks where I can just be lying in bed and I have a wave of heat, my heart pounds to the point I feel like I'm having a heart attack, I have pains in my head which I've been told is related to how tense my neck is from this stress, it got to the point where I was histerically screaming to my friends and family to call me an ambulance and I thought I was going to die if I went to sleep and I had my mum check on me every morning if I was still breathing, I constantly have a lump in my throat which makes me panic to the point I can't breathe which has given me a big fear that my throat will fully close up I am not allergic to any foods however because of this fear I have planted the seed in my head that I might be therefor I am scared to eat and because of this I've lost a lot of weight. I know it is anxiety but I can't help but feel like its a physical thing and there is something seriously wrong with me, this anxiety has got me to breaking point and I'm terrified, I've left the house about 7 times within 3 months for doctors appointments which they have said everything is fine, but I still can't be left alone for longer than 15 minutes, this is really wrecking my life is anybody else suffering with this?
