Struggling with side effects coming off tamoxifen¥	hi everyone, not sure anyone can shine a light on how I'm feeling? ¥	I came off tamoxifen 6weeks ago ready to have reconstruction on 15th April after taking it 18mths. My operation was cancelled and have a new date 13th may. ¥	My hot flushes have intensified and my joints hurt that much that I feel sick. I'm feeling more and more dizzy.Not sure if some of the symptoms I'm having are due to stress? I'm grinding my teeth at night and wake up with my hands numb and clawed. ¥	Its mad I know I've put that much pressure on myself to make everything as organised as I can before I go in. My hubby is very capable and don't need me to do plan everything ( maybe it's just me trying to keep busy) after giving up my job ready for 15th April. ¥	I know lots of you have many side effects on tamoxifen but I seem to be having more without them! It also leaves me feeling vulnerable being off them longer than planned due to operation being cancelled. I've been waiting a long time for reconstruction and maybe I'm starting to panic ( one if its cancelled again and two it's getting closer¥	Has any one had the same problems? Thanks k
