No Desire To Eat2 months into my diagnosis, found the forum more or less straight away and started LCHF, I have great control over my bloods thanks to good advice, all seems to have happened so quickly.I went from loving food and stuffing my face with carbs (pre diagnosis) to LCHF and have done really well, but the past few days I just don't feel like eating anything, it's weird going from one extreme to the other, I know I need to eat and I pretty much know what to eat, but when I think of all the foods that are available to me, I just have no desire to eat.A little worried because I can't force it down my neck, has anyone else experienced this ?Thanks in advance.
