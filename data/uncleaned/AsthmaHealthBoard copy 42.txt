Do colds affect peak flow meters?________________________________________Hello again, Urgh, fall and winter seasons are driving me nuts. Since about two weeks ago, I was having really itchy eyes and nose symptoms. Then this week on Wednesday, I woke up with my nose completely stuffed and a harsh cough followed soon after. I have been checking my peak flow meter ratings since I got my cold and it has been the same at the usual 450-470 (5'5", 25, female), however, tonight I checked after I felt difficultly breathing and coughing when laying down. I cannot get it above 400. It keeps on hovering around 370-390. This is the first time I've had a low peak flow rating. I took a puff of Symbicort for the first time in a few months, and even though it's been 40 minutes there has been no change. Should I be worried? Do colds affect PFM? I feel like I always have to take extra precautions because I'm living in Japan, and there hospitals aren't always open :,(I still feel some chest tightness, but otherwise feel okay.Please help...Thank you.
