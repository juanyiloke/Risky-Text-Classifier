When I was first hired to do police work, my CO told me to expect some PTSD with the work and that all cops have it to some degree. He ordered me to tell whoever was my significant other to expect me to have some really bad nightmares and talking/shouting in my sleep and that it is normal for most cops to have this. So with firefighters seeing so much in their work, I'm sure its the same for firefighters too. Talk to your Fire department Chaplain about it and see if he can connect you to services to deal with it.
