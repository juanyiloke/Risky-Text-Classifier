  How did you find TTL and what has it done for you?Well, one night I was really upset and on the edge of doing something I knew I would regret later. Trusting good old Google as my friend, I typed in "i need someone to talk to" and Take This Life came up as one of the many links. I quickly made a profile and read some of the posts from the community. I had always liked typing stuff down to help me feel better, and i found it even better when i get such positive feedback from the community.. reaching out to me like a sibling or as their child. There is so much support here and for that I thank everyone. You are all amazing people and I hope all of your dreams come true!Thanks everyone (((hugs))
