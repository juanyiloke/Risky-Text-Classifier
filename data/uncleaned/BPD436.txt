ÊThe Border in the WorkplaceHello fellow borders. Its been a while since I've visited, much less posted. :3I wanted to hear other's experiences on being in the workplace. Its a well documented statistic that BPDs struggle to maintain self supporting employment even after the gold standard treatment: DBT. Not surprising considering our challenges.I recently was laid off with reasons given that amounted to me being unliked by others, a poorer fit than my peers for meshing well with the team. It has made me feel a bit helpless. I am high functioning and my desire is to have a normal life.How have you been treated in the workplace that was unfair or seemed impossible to overcome due to being a border?Please share!If you are low functioning and cannot work, share too!Also any links on the topic are welcome.
