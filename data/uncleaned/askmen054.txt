Am I digging myself into a hole?2013-08-07, 05:12 PMI'm hoping a Mathematician or two frequents this board. Some time ago, I posted asking about the field of Geographical Information Systems. My undergraduate degree is in Mathematics, so I've decided to seek an M.S. in Mathematics along with a certificate in GIS.However, I'm concerned that I may be taking on too much. For this semester, I have Intro to GIS, Abstract Algebra, and Real Analysis.ÊI've had undergraduate courses in Algebra and Analysis, but I think I'm safe in assuming that graduate level will be much more rigorous and at a faster pace. My undergraduate grades were: Abstract Algebra: A-, Analysis: B+My Algebra course consisted of a treatment of group theory, along with a few applications such as error correcting codes.ÊMy Analysis course was mainly proof based, and covered the development of the reals from the rationals, topology of R^n, sequences and limit points. We did not go through differentiation and integration theorems from an advanced standpoint.ÊSo to get to the point, I'm taking these classes and I also work full time. Am I making a mistake taking 9 hours of graduate courses while maintaining such a workload?Any insight and advice would be very welcome. School starts in two weeks, and I've worried about this for some time now.
