What can I do to help my boyfriend with his eating problems?My boyfriend is 23 years old, he has terrible eating habits and it worries me greatly what affect it is having on his current health and future health. I told him to speak to a doctor, to possible get referred to a dietician or nutritionist and the doctor point blank refused and said it was only for people who had health problems. Diabetes, is present in his family on his dad's side, his dad has type 2 and his grandmother has type 1 diabetes. He eats only the following things:And that is all he eats, what he does eat is nearly always covered in ketchup as well. He doesn't not like or eat any vegetables. He does like a small selection of fruit but he doesnt eat it enough either way (but that's just laziness on his part). He does not like milk, cheese or butter (but does like yoghurts) however this means he nearly always doesn't eat breakfast as he wont eat cereal or toast. As he doesn't like butter the only sandwich that he eats is a jam sandwich. He eats a lot of chocolate and sweet things, which I feel is almost certain to lead to diabetes when he is older.He often complains of stomach pains, which Im guessing is due to his digestive track struggling with the type of food he eats?What I struggle to understand is he physically doesn't like the taste of the food, he is not being lazy and just not eating healthy food although more fruit and less chocolate would help I know. He is not afraid to try new food and he does want to be more healthy but he doesn't know how as he doesn't like the taste of so many things.Is there anything that can be medically done or investigated, that could lead to helping him? Is it possible to have something wrong with your taste buds? If he increased his exercise would that counteract the lack of healthy diet, or at least reduce the affects of a lack of healthy diet?Any advice on what to do, is gratefully appreciated. Feel free to ask any questions.
