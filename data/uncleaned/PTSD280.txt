Possible PTSD?by A_Curr19 » Mon May 05, 2014 2:29 amI am eighteen years old and stayed home alone for the second time (ever) this weekend. While I was in the house the basement was broken into. They came in and unlocked windows so they could return later on that night to steal the things they wanted. RCMP came and searched the house to insure no one was still there, and then left promising to patrol the area all night in case they were needed. Ever since this happened I have been terrified of someone coming in the house. My bedroom is in the basement and I can't sleep at night, frozen in terror. All I can do is cry, the incident never leaves my mind. Could this be mild PTSD?
