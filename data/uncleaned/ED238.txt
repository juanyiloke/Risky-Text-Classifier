 Binge Eating Bulimics First Ask for HelpHi There,I have been a binge eating bulimic for over 4 years now, I can't stop! During the day I am fine, night time hits (i work long hours & this is the only time I'm alone) and when my boyfriend is away at work, I binge eat everything in sight till I feel ill, then I purge every last bit up, followed by the feeling of disgust & saying that will be the last time.On the weekend, and after a few drinks - I finally told my secret to one person whom I trust & knew wouldn't judge, he has encouraged me to seek help & this is my first step. He has also said whenever I feel the urge to call him to break the habit, even if its just for a chat. I am so thankful for my friends support - as I havent felt comfortable telling anyone, not even my boyfriend of 6 years.I use to weigh less than I do now so atm I feel so gross - i feel disgusting & I am constantly bloated & get tummy aches/sore throat from all the purging.Can anyone give me advice on how they broke the habit & what can help me stop. I know I'm doing damage to my body & I just want to rid myself of this awful thing that I feel is controlling my life.Help
