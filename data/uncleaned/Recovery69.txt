Concentrating On My Physical HealthI feel as though I have a grip on my mental health, have been out of therapy now for 6 months and although I've gone back on Olanzapine (still on citalopram too) this is mainly as it keeps insomnia at bay. I've now reached the point where my physical health needs to be addressed. I've joined Weight Watchers and estimate it will be around a year until I reach my goal weight. I've also started exercising, swimming ideally twice a week depending on other things I have planned, a very brisk hilly walk with a friend once a week and I am also attempting, not too successfully the couch to 5K (C25K) running programme. Has anyone tried this? I am lucky as my garden backs onto meadows and a path alongside the canal so I can jog in tranquility with few people to see me!What exercise is helping you?Girly
