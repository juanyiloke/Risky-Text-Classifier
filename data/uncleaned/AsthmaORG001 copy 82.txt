Help 16 month old son Chest infection 3 weeks of steroids Hi my son has been poorly for the last 3 weeks he has had 2 lots of steroids, then a 5 day break and then finished his 25mg prednisolone yesterday. He is also on third lot of anti biotics. He does also have a snotty nose but is very wheezy more than 60 bpm but is eating and playing just short of breath.I am at a loss of what to do next. He's on blue inhaler 2 puffs when required and clenil 2 times morning and night. Has anyone else had a stubborn infection like this?
