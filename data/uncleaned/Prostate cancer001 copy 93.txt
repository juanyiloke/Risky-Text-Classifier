Stampede - arms J and G Hello all.I've signed up for Stampede and been allocated Arm J, hormone treatment plus abiraterone and enzalutimide. The unanswerable question is whether this will improve my overall survival times, or whether having the drugs up front means that they will be ineffective as later treatments.A couple of questions for you guys:a) does anyone know of the pre-clinical work done on this trial - specifically what the evidence suggests will happen in terms of survival times? There's got to be some reason why they're testing this rather than it being just a hunch.b) was anyone here on the Arm G trial (hormone plus abiraterone) and, if so, what was their experience? Has anyone had abiraterone again after coming off the trial and was it still effective?
