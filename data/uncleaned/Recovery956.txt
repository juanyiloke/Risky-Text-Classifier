Some life adviceNot really 'active' here now, sorry if i'm in the wrong thread. I've been going through vigorous self-exploration lately. Honestly the alternative is obvious for me. Thought these words may offer slight hope/ comfort. ~ We all feel pain, that seems to have no reason/ escape. You're not alone/ worthless/ burdensome. You're human. ~ Your body works hard literally 24/7. If nothing else, respect it with sleep/ avoid intoxicants. Learn to love it, if only for the definitive mind/ body relationship. ~ You and only you deserve 100% of your love/ trust. Offer everyone else 99%~ Turn that sympathy you feel for others in pain, toward your self. If you feel sad, tell your self 'it's ok to feel down' or 'you will be ok soon' or 'i love you, please feel better soon' it can be done to any emotion. The aim is to not feel guilty about having strong feelings, and eventually offer your self comfort. ~ Start over. You can start a new life right this moment. You might have the luxury to move away/ cut your old relationships. Odds are you can't right now, but you *can* cut bad relationships off, find new insight, look for a new job/ living space, or otherwise 'start fresh' is that what leads to suicidal thoughts at times? Wanting to erase mistakes/ go somewhere new/ feel 'reborn'? Try doing it in this life first. What could you loose, compared to your life? I've learned to do it daily. 'The man i was died long ago.. I'm a new person today' it's true in my case. ~ Learn how you personally think. These over-whelming emotions stem from certain thought-patterns usually. Calmly listen to your thoughts, and pay attention to what causes strong responses. You now know what you need to focus on healing. This is both useful in focused meditation, and as a constant state of mind. ~ Limit action *not* emotion. I know it's hard to allow your self to feel pain. We all want the pain to 'go away' the truth is, like any force, we can't just make it disappear. But we can change it. If you feel pain, question why exactly you feel this way, that sometimes calms things down (especially anger) make an effort to re-direct your thoughts. Offer your self sympathy. And let your self feel things, just don't act impulsively. ~ Love your self, and forgive your self. The only ways to learn why/ how are to know your self. You are either a constant source of support, or pain/ doubt. That vague sense of pain you get from reading this? It's your mind asking you to offer it love and support. Listen to it, you don't deserve to feel hurt, or to die. You deserve love/ peace/ comfort/ happiness. You will always have it, so long as you let your self feel it.These are words from a man with many scars/ attempts/ sleepless nights. I hope you can find something to find the peace in this life, that you should never have gone without. "The truth is out there" Ex files. ~ Lorax
