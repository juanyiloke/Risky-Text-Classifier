Struggling with focusing on getting work done..2013-09-24, 11:38 PMI'm a hard worker when I want to be, and I enjoy my job quite a bit.Sometimes, I find myself wanting to do many different things in one day, and so I find that placing a schedule of enjoying everything at a certain time frame will let me at least get the benefit of efficiently using my time.Boy am I wrong, all it's done is given me anxiety from true enjoyment and relaxation because everything is scheduled.Nevertheless, I find myself procrastinating on getting work done sometimes. I was hoping to get some insight on tips on some of the things you folks do to help you sit down, concentrate and produce some Grade A work?To be fair, once I focus and get into it.. It's hard for me to walk away. It's the initial approach that is always more so difficult to handle. I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day though. Sometimes, doesn't seem likes its enough.What do you think?
