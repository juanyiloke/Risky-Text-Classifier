ÊWeird Hallucination*in the morning, when i woke up to get ready for school. i got up sat in my bed for a few minutes. then i heard something. kinda like faint talking. couldn't really make it out. so i went to my window and all the kids that are at my bus stop started walking from there houses and to the bus stop (it is right in front of my house.) i was confused because when i checked my phone the time was only 6:40 and they don't normally start piling up till 7:11. and it was still dark out. which normally it is actually lit up outside around 7:00 or so. so that confused me as well. but anyway i started getting ready (in a hurry, i didn't want to miss the bus.) every few minutes or so i would look outside just in case my mind was playing with me. but they were still there clear as day talking and everything. then one of the houses turned its porch light off. after the bus came and everyone got on the bus and left. which nerved me because the time read 6:59 and the bus doesn't normally come till 7:16. then all the cars left. (from when there parents or whatever left after dropping them off) and i just sat there like. crap i just missed my bus. because of still being a bit curious i waited till it was 7:11 and i saw the exact same people i just saw leave coming out of their houses and going to the bus stop. the cars and everything came. the porch light stayed off however. and that's when i went outside and got on the bus. when it came. i still don't really know what happened whether or not this was a hallucination or not. :/Ê~
