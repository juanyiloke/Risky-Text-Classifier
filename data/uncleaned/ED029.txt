is this an ED?I know that I can't really diagnose myself here, so I'm here for advices.(Sorry for any grammatical errors, english is not my native language)So, I'm not sure if I have an eating disorder. Unlike what I always read from the internet, I think I'm considered healthy. I eat normal meals everyday with small snacks in between. But I still feel like food is controlling me. Like this morning, my mum was on her way to the bakery and asked if I want anything. I felt like crying because while I really want to eat, I'm really scared to gain weight. It's like I'll never ever be able to enjoy the food I used to love anymore.Is this the way to live.. being having to control my food intake every single day.It's confusing whether if this is considered a disorder because I don't starve myself or binge on food, but I'm always worrying about food.I really missed my old self.Thank you. Any help wi be appreciated.
