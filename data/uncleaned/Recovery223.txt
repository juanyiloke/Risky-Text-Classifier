  How I stopped suffer from depression?________________________________________Hi guys, I just posted the same post in the forum of anxiety, hope it's allowed to post it here too. The reason I do it, is because I used to suffer from depression AND anxiety together, so that's why I want both communities will read it.Well, didn't really stop completely having depressions, but I can say for sure that I feel so much confident, secure and... happier.If I used to have panic attack or anxiety every other day, now I face it once a month, sometimes I don't have anxiety or depression for almost 2 months. This is a huge change for me.So how did I do it?very easily.about a year ago I've decided that I'm going to take responsibility and make a commitment to myself to live a better life. I've searched online and I came across this amazing YouTube channel -https://www.youtube.com/user/VortexSuccessBasically this channle is about subliminal messages and binaural beats. after researching online, I found out that subliminal messages have huge impact on the subconscious mind.So since then, every night before going to sleep I listen to this subliminal meditations for free. This guy (or girl, I don't know) on YouTube shares wonderful content for free. If you like, here's his websiteVortex Success|Program your subconscious mind with Subliminal MessagesI recommend it to anybody I know that suffers from anxiety, depression, low confidence and stuff like that.For me, what really made the difference is the commitment of listening every night. I mean, even if I didn't feel like it, I still did it because I knew it's gonna pay off in the long run.Hope it will help you guys.Btw, if you know anything about these binaural recordings or subliminal messages, let me know.Much love
