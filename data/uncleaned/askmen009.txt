Tomorrow's workforce in America will not be US workers2014-09-09, 07:40 AMI often am asked to represent my company at various career fairs in the DC area. I have attended 4 over the past 2 years. My employer mostly hires finance/accounting/MBA students and I am totally amazed at how the vast majority of these students at career fairs are not US citizens nor are they American kids. They are mostly from Asia, specifically, China. I was talking to another recruiter at the latest career fair about how of the hundred or so resumes we received, not one was a natural born US citizen and many that speak with us are requesting sponsorship for US visas/citizenship. Most companies at these career fairs do not offer sponsorship and require a visa or US citizenship as a condition of employment. The recruiter was saying that over the years, the numbers of American kids attending these college and industry-related career fairs looking for jobs in the finance/accounting industry are declining year after year. He said that soon enough, companies will have to start offering sponsorship to foreign students because otherwise, qualified entry level workers will not be available.This seems to be somewhat of a theme lately, as the push for immigration reform is supported by many big businesses and organizations like the US Chamber of Commerce. I can understand that many employers hiring unskilled labor push for foreign workers as a means to cut costs as they are willing to work more for less pay. But I also believe that US workers are decreasingly possessing the skills that employers are seeking, as evinced by the lack of relevant degrees at these career fairs.Where the heck are the US workers going?DC Rising!
