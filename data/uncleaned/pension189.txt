Farrow wraps.I have been suffering from ulcers on my legs and now they have mostly healed up.  Went to the clinic recently and have been advised to wear Farrow wraps. They are very comfortable but the question has arisen should they be taken off at night ot not. The clinic said yes but the nurses that come weekly have advised me to take them off.  Does anyone else  know any information regarding these as I would love to know other views on this subject.
