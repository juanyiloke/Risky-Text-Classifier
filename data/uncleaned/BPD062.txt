I really need some supportby blurryface » Sat May 30, 2015 1:19 amHi guys,Just for the record, I haven't been diagnosed with BPD and I haven't self diagnosed myself with it either. However I stumbled across BPD forums and symptoms and identify with some of them. I have previously been diagnosed with Panic disorder and depression and I am currently speaking with a psychologist and am being assessed as I seem to have other issues but I just don't seem to identify with people on other forums and you guys seem less judgemental and I identify with some of the issues that some people on this forum struggle with. I am in desperate need for support right now so was wondering if it would be okay and not offend anyone if I post in this forum for support and stuff even though I'm not diagnosed? Thank you
