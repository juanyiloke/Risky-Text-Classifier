I am a boy. I'm 15 years old. I weigh 120 pounds. She is a girl. I don't know how old she is. She Is the skinniest person I have ever seen. She is my best friend and my worst enemy. I think she's crazy. She'll talk to people, fiends of mine. Then my friends will turn to me and act like I said everything she said, but I didn't say any of it; she did. Her head is shaved. She is strong, like she works out and she's so good at talking to people. Sometimes I want to be her, until I remember how crazy she is. I think she loves me though. She kind of picks on me, but when I'm sad She'll comfort me. I guess I'm kind of sad alot. People pretend she isn't real, like it's a big joke everybody is in on but me. My mom isn't very nice to me. She gets impatient with me and acts like She is invisible. Sometimes She gets scary. She will follow me wherever I go and hurt people and make them bleed but then people will pretend I hurt them, and get mad at me. That's not fair. I told her I didn't want her around anymore and she laughed. She told me to come here and talk about my nightmare. I didn't mean to talk about her so much, sorry. I came here to talk about my nightmare. I have this nightmare every night where I'm lying on a beach and staring up at the sky. She'll walk up to me and lean over and smile and say 'It's what you need,' and start laughing when a bunch of crows fly down and start eating me alive. It's scary because it hurts and I can't move and because she just keeps laughing like it's funny but it isn't because I'm dying. She says that she isn't going anywhere no matter what I do. She says that She is my friend and that she knows what's best for me. I guess I don't mind Her staying around. I was going to post this in the "Sleeping Disorder" forum but decided it would be best to post it here after talking about how manic She must be to do what she does.
