How do i gain weight on one of my legs? REALLY SERIOUSI am 14 years of age and one of my legs, my left leg, appears to be completely malnourished. My right leg however is in a perfectly normal condition, and i am able to feel the muscles inside my right thigh. On my left leg, there is literally no muscle in it and it is practically bone. As you can tell i am very scared at this moment and i am desperate for some help and advice. My question is that how am i able to gain weight on my left leg? Or is it a problem with my metabolism or something inside of my body that is preventing my left leg from gaining any weight at all? What i can say is that, this may sound strange, but i eat very fatty foods regularly and have regular things to eat at dinner and tea times. Also i do not eat any meat other than sausages and the chicken from the likes of McDonalds and KFC, which i feel may have an affect on this. I am not exaggerating when i say that my left leg itself is most definitely anorexic, and my right leg is perfectly normal. Please help me as i have been living with this problem for over a year and finally decided to express it with you on here.
