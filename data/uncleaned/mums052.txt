DD, nearly 6 months has just gone to sleep without her dummy for the first time....so feeling triumphant about that. Unfortunately she cried herself to sleep while I was putting DS1&2 to bed in the next room - I did keep giving her the dummy back and trying to resettle her in between reading their bedtime stories but she kept spitting it out and crying more. Then she went quiet at the end of the boys bedtime and lo and behold she was fast asleep all by herself! But now I feel guilty for letting her cry herself to sleep for the first time. Should I get rid of the dummy now she has managed it once? Feel awful hearing her cry but it was probably less than 10mins in the end.
