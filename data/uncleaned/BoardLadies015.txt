I am a womanDo the rest of you lovely ladies get mistaken for being male simply by your posting style?I get it every single time I post on boards.(I am a woman by the way).I think it has to do with tone, I am curt and to the point. In person I'm just called a b*tch, I can sort of understand why I get mistaken for male online.Does it insult you? It makes me feel less every time.
