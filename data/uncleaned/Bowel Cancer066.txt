Searing pain in anus post reversalI had rectal cancer a year back. Tumour was surgically removed at fairly low level of rectum. Was lucky to have left with some rectum. Ileostomy reversal was done a couple of months back. I was carrying on with the usually expected complaints of frequent bathroom visits, lack of control, anal pain, bum rashes etc. For the last ten days, I've developed a new piercing pain in the anus verge frequently while passing stools. Its as if having extraordinary difficulty in pushing out the lump/gas. My surgeon has done a thorough digital examination of the anal route and found nothing untoward like some growth or fissure or something. Don't know what causes the extreme burning sensation near the anus while trying to expel my output. If anybody has any idea about what I'm going through, please advise. Passing through hellish times. Thanks in advance.
