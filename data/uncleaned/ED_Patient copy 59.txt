On recovery, with some bad side effects :(Hi all! So i have been going through a really tough time since about july. I had been diagnosed with an eating disorder after an appointment with the doctor where i am down to 44.5kgs. I am trying to get back to about 48kg. It doesnt sound like i lost a lot, but i am a very small frame already and quiet short, so yes, this was a dramatic loss on me. Anyway, i have definitely realized over the past few months that i was not being healthy and i got down to too low of a weight, so im trying to recover. I am now at about 45.5-46kgs. this is good news! although, i have been going through terrible constipation (which over the past week has actually become a lot better thankfully due to prunes, upping my fibre and overall intake and dandellion tea at night- i reccommend!) although, i am always sooo bloated. this has really emotionally gotten to me because i used to never bloat so now im really uncomfortable. its going to be summer soon and im going to feel so insecure in a bikini if im bloated, im worried it will get in the way of my recovery. When i bloat its obvious because the rest of me is so thin so i look funny. Does anyone know when the chronic bloating will stop after meals? Or how i can reduce it, tips, tricks or just foods to stay away from? it would mean so much to me! I also am just wondering, foods i should be eating to gain weight but in a healthy manner. thanks to whoever answers this. I just need some reassuarance i guess, but also some legitimate advice and honesty.
