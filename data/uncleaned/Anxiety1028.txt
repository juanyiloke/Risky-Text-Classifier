Mind over stomachHey everyone, new member here. I have been struggling with anxiety-related nausea for a while and wanted to know if anyone could relate or had any ideas how to approach this. I've had GAD for years, which always manifests in somatic symptoms even though I don't necessarily feel any mental anguish. About a year ago, I started waking up with nausea. I initially thought it was related to a new medication but finally realized it was linked to anxiety. Once I made that realization, the NAUSEA STOPPED. It was great. I was fine for months thanks to an SSRI and better coping skills. However I recently have had some huge sources of stress, one involving my career, the other being an unexpected death in the family. Now the nausea is back, and is even accompanied by vomiting sometimes. I can control it with anti-nausea meds but I do not want to be a slave to them as they make me drowsy.ÊA couple of things I want to mention: I know for sure that this is mental, not physical. Also, it goes away with distractions, and I am able to get food down. It also improves throughout the day and is at its worst in the morning (no way I'm pregnant either). I am really frustrated because I was able to defeat this once before, but for some reason, now I can't. It's so frustrating to know a symptom is just functional, but not be able to do anything to control it. I also have another huge stressor (although a good one) in the months to come and can't be taking time off of work because I am vomiting.Thanks!
