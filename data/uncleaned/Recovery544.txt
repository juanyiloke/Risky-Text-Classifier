  happy placeWhen I'm alone and not under pressure orstress .... I would like to imagine myself riding on the back of a pick-up truck with pillows and blankets, on a dry-dirt road of an open field, small hills at the side, it's cloudy but it's bright, a cig between my fingers, reggae music playing, then stops at the edge of a small hill. Viewing the beautiful beach, hearing the waves, and just enjoying the nice day.or if I'm stressed out I would think I'm reigning death upon the human race... something morbid, ahaha can't really make a descriptive image about it :( happy thoughts happy thoughts~what's your happy thoughts~ if none, why not make one now :)
