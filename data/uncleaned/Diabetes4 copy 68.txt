What next after metformin?I just wondered if anyone knew what sort of drugs the GPs go for when metformin isn't working too well?  Are there any medicines people prefer/get bad side effects etc?  (I dont really get the time to do the sort or research i would normally so hoped asking here would focus what i need to look at).  I need to get back to the GPs about my diabetes, as the few tests ive done recently nothing has been under an 8.1 and fasting is in the 9's, 2hr post-meals are 12's+.  Ive just scared the heck out of myself too found a little stone between my toes with my fingers, but i didnt know it was there by toe nerves which has terrified me.  I will ask again for insulin, but i fear that i will be told no so need to get some info on what is next in line before i agree to it.  I think my pancreas is giving up a bit more after such a good control in pregnancy.
