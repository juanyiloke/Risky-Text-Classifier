Worrying and anxious.¥	This waiting about for my appointment is got me full of anxiousness. Constantly wondering when it will come in the post. I had one letter confirming that the doctor has sent information to the clinic. I'm constantly checking my breast for anymore changes. An it's only been 6 days since I went to the doctors. I feel really bad as I see loads of people struggling with what they are going through and I'v not even been to the clinic yet. I keep telling myself that I will be ok and really hope I am. I think everyone on here are so brave!
