why do people look down upon who study engineering? (Pgs: 1 2)by kev909I'm from Hong Kong and I'm doing my last year A-levels studies. Meanwhile I'm applying uni in hk for engineering program. Okay, local people in Hong Kong often think that people who study engineering in uni because their academic result are not that good enough and couldn't get in to faculty of business/medicine/law e.t.c. In their mind, medicine (MBBS), law (LLB), B.Ba e.t.c. are the only few options. I would like to study engineering in uni and in general speaking that is my dream. However, some people who self-consider they are good enough in academic studies often look down on me, as well as who study engineering. I have no idea whether people in here have this kind of view or people around the world also think in this way, as many people that I know do think in this way and to be honest, even some of my family members. In addition, even students here who are studying engineering in uni also look down upon themselves and they study very hard in their first year in order to change their major from engineering to other program. They always claim engineering is not a really good option for the future when comparing with other competitive program like what I mentioned before.yeah, really wanna know what people in tsr think. thx in advance for reading my threat.
