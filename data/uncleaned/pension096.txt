Halifax BankI cannot understand the workings of Halifax Bank which operate on a working day to exclude Saturday and Sunday.Ê It is my understanding that people who bank with Nationwide, NatWest and other High Street banks their pension and pension credit is available for withdrawal on a Saturday morning.Ê With Halifax it is to credited to the account until the following Monday which means they accrue interest for the 48 hours.Ê We talk about rip of Britain but having gone overdrawn - Saturday and Sunday - I am being charged £5.00 for each day when in theory I am not overdrawn.Does anyone else have a similar experience with Halifax or shed any light of their bank practices as it is beyond my comprehension.Ê If others are alos being affected perhaps we could form a pressure group to effect change of these unfair practices affecting those of us on low income.
