Schizophrenia,antipsychotics, and constipationby freefee » Wed Apr 22, 2015 9:28 pmThis is really serious. From all the schizophrenics done in a study, seventy percent of fecal matter in the guts should already have been disspelled. This can lead to serious health problems. Much like with opioid dependency, the health risks could lead to one of those bags attached inside your intestines. I have been trying something and lost about twenty pounds so far. It feels great to be health. The ingriedeints are .....3 tablespoons of braggs, undistilled apple cider vingegar, one table spoon of baking soda, and cyaene pepper. Everything but the baking soda is sold at vitamen shops. The cayene pepper comes in capsules, good, cause it is the hottest pepper i have ever tried, but it is also a key ingriedent in a master cleanse I heard about. Besides relieving constipation, your liver gets cleansed, and has a lot of other health benefits I've heard about. Even if you have a few extra pounds on you, you feel great when your stomachs flat. Some people report instant euphoria after ingesting the ingreiedients. Also a fiber supplement they have in oragnge flavor keeps the thing rollin. I know this is a dirty topic that most people dont like to talk about, but trying this stuff is defiently worth it. O yea, you have to add it to water, I use about three inches of water in a cup. There's a chemical reaction between the baking soda and the ACV. If you fill the water to high it will sud up all over the place.
