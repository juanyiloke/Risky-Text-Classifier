Is a morning cough a sign of Asthma?  11  My toddler is 2 years old and has had a thick wet cough every morning for the last month. I've been to the GP's and all he said was her lungs sounded clear and the cough will pass. I've been doing a little bit of googling and it seems the cough could be a sign of asthma or allergies. Not sure what to though. We have a cat but he has been around for awhile. So, I don't believe the cat is the trigger.I am not convinced by my GP's 'it will pass'. Was hoping if anyone has a similar experience and any advice would be grateful.
