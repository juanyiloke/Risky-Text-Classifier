Return of the Chronic Cough________________________________________So, my Chronic Cough is back. I've been coughing for about 2 months now. It is extremely unpleasant. I cough throughout the day and have developed a lot of sore muscles and ribs and some bladder issues from it. When I have coughing attacks, the coughing is so bad that I end up heaving and sometimes vomiting. This happens a lot in the mornings when it lasts from about 1-3 hours before I can even think about leaving for work. I end up bringing up my meds a couple times a week too.  We had some nasty air set in last December that triggered my coughing. It has pretty much been a constant until yesterday--Worn my 'Darth Vader' face mask all winter. While I know it is a major influence, all of the doctors have agreed it isn't my only problem.Causes of Chronic Cough:*Asthma: I'm on Dulera a couple times a day, Singular, Albuterol as needed (Puffer or Nebulizer), Xolair shots monthly, and I've done a round of Prednisone. Ironically, my lungs don't actually sound too horrible lately.*Allergies/PND: I'm 6 years into immunotherapy and not currently on any allergy meds. I am on Promethazine DM or Promethazine with Codeine which do have antihistamine properties. I saw my ENT and had a scope last week. My throat is red and there is a bit of mucous, but no signs of allergy or PND.*Acid Reflux: I had a Nissen Fundoplication 5 years ago. I take Dulera daily and supplement with OTC meds. I spent a couple weeks in December taking Dulera twice a day and really didn't see much difference. I started on them twice a day again yesterday. I had a good Endoscopy last fall and had pH testing on Dulera then as well. The testing indicates my acid reflux is controlled on the medications. I do sleep on an incline too.Conclusions:My PCP has tried several meds with me that haven't worked. He gave me the cough syrups and Prednisone. My last visit, he told me we had done everything he had to offer since I was already doing so many things to address the problem.My ENT/Allergist Put me on Levaquin since I'd already tried so many things and there was a bit of redness and mucous in the scope. I'm a week out on it with no difference so far. He was nice enough to bump the Promethazine scipt from DM to Codeine. He indicated I have a reactive airway happening. He basically told me that I was already doing so many of the right things already. He did have me get a chest x-ray which is good.My Gastroenterologist yesterday went through everything I've tried and reviewed all the testing I've had. He did recommend being more aggressive in treating my IBS with medications, even when I'm feeling OK, because it can through off my balance. He also thinks I may have more non-acid reflux influencing my cough, but I'm already on all the treatments they would recommend for that. He told me that I was a 'unique' patient who doesn't respond to treatment like others do. Translation to me: he doesn't really know what else to recommend either. I have a lot of trouble getting appointments with my Pulmonologist. I scheduled one last August and it isn't for a few more weeks. They haven't had any cancellations either. I'll have some PFT's prior. At this point, I'm not sure what he will be able to offer me though.I've had Pertussis before and this doesn't feel the same.At this point, I'm miserable, but have no idea what else to try. I have coughing fits throughout the day and spend many mornings coughing/heaving and trying to catch my breath.I'd love to hear from anyone who has something to offer.Thanks for listening.MR
