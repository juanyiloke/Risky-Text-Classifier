I need a Coach/Mentor- In Debt denial for years and have a low salary.2013-05-01, 06:36 PMThe Good: I do not live beyond my means and have not acquired any new debt in a year. I work in an industry I love that I am new to and see a world of opportunity. Especially for someone who is driven and would like to work for themselves. Lets say I am much closer to being on the right path then I've ever been in a short 8 months. The Bad I do not make much as I am at the bottom of the totem pole. My company was not hiring when I submitted my resume but they saw potential and 8 months later things are going very well. I am in debt. 90% Student Loans. $3000 in Credit Cards, $1000 to parents to help me cover medical bills. For someone who has not been responsible with their money in the better part of my 20's I'm doing ok. I do not live beyond my means and consider myslef a minimalist. By August of this year I will have been with my company for 1 year but I am not making any headway on my debt or savings. I would love to save for travel and work on starting my own business over the course of the next 4 months.I know I do not want to stay in this corporate setting for long. I am "working in the shadows" on potential ideas to run my own consulting business and building a strong network in my industry. Have any of you attempted to start a business in Debt? Should I erase the thought of traveling from my mind until I get this taken care of? How have you attacked debt successively?
