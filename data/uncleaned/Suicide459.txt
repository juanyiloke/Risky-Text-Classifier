what if u are not able to live upto d expectations of otherskritikahy im kritika 19 years old from india. I hate myself of being such a bitch. my dad want me to become a doctor n i’ve dropped 2 years for that. yesterday I had pmt (test for mbbs in india) n it was worst than ever. I dont want to face my parents I dont want them to feel that their daughter is worthless a failure.if I don’t crack exam this time he’ll push me to private medical college. fee in private college is very very very high. he’ll end up taking loans from financers who charge so much.tomorrow is my result if I don’t get selected I will pose myself to death.I’ll try my hands on over dosage of sleeping pills. bt I don’t know which method would be effective. Im searcing some methods.but I seriously dont want to die because I have a boyfrnd who love me like hell but still I can’t face my parents of my failure….
