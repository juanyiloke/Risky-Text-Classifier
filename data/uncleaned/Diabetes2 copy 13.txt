diabetes insipidus   Hi AllI am now 39 years old and at the age of 36 was diagnosed with Diabetes insipidus. I am employed as a diabetes specialist nurse and had never even heard of diabetes insipidus and felt so very silly. I felt exhausted at the time as was drinking approx 6-8 liters a day and passing the same in urine. I was constantly on the toliet day and night hence I was getting no sleep and trying to continue to go to work.I visited my GP whom was at a loss and arranged routine blood test ie glucose levels at this time it was a colleague whom mentioned diabetes insipidus and when I read more about this it fitted exactly how I was feeling. I returned to my GP whom arranged the appropriate tests and within 24 hours I was admitted to hospital.In hospital my condition deteriated and we remain unsure why this was and no cause has ever been established for my diabetes insipidus. The results from my MRI scan did indicate substantial inflammation of the pituary gland but as to why is a loss this has since subsided without treatment for this. I have had a variety of tests and continue to be monitored very carefully and can not fault the care I recieved.I know it is a very rare condition and would live to hear from anyone whom also has diabetes insipidus and there experiences. I was initally prescribed Desmopressin spray twicw daily but this remianed difficult to control my hydration levels and over a year ago my cosultant changed me to the tablets and these have completley changed my life for the better and I believe my diabetes insipidus is far better controlled from these. However GPs do remain reluctant to prescribe these due to cost although my GP has been excellent.
