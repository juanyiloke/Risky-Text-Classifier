  overcoming self-harmOkay, I'm kinda happy, kinda sad, I don't know. I always thought SH was such a big part of me.. I never thought I'd even consider stopping. A while ago I thought about all the sadness I was putting my mother, brother, and boyfriend through and I couldn't stop crying. I remembered all the times they've disinfected my cuts  and put ice over thebruises , all the times they've taken me to thehospital , all those nights I called for their support.. I was like a blind man facing a hill covered in daisies in the spring-time; unable to see the good things. At seeing bad things I was/am an eagle, though.Anyways, I'm happy mostly because my family is happy, but I'm sad  when I get the urge to SH and I have to ignore it. It's there in the back  of my head. I know it's not the best  solution so I try to do other things instead.I call my boyfriend and talk about it. I go over mymom's  house and we bake, watch a movie, anything to keep me doing something. My brother takes me swimming. Anything. The urge to SH is slowly decreasing. I know I can't ever be completely 'okay', but I'm trying.Sometimes, when I want to be alone but don't want to SH, I play my favorite  album loudly and clap really hard to the rhythm of the music. It's kinda crazy. haha. But it keeps my mind off things. Plus, it feels like I'm in a gig.So yeah, I haven't stopped, but that's my goal, and I'm halfway there
