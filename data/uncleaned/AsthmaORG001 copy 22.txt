Peak flow and playing woodwind instruments General Just wondered if anybody else had come across this one. I'm only 5'3'', but have a best ever PEFR of 660, which is much higher than it should be. The only reason anybody can come up with is that I've played clarinet and recorder since I was a child (now 39). The down side of this is that a PEFR which looks OK to most Dr's means I'm in trouble, and I can keep my PEFR up even when very symptomatic which also causes a few problems! I'd be intersested to hear if any other woodwind players have come up against this.
