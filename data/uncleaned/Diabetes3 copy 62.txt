Another diagnosisHello everybody, I hope all is well in your Diabteic world.Not been on in a while, been having some personal issues but I won't go into that here. Quick update on things, my breathing and my lungs are still very much the same, I'm still struggling with the everyday things but trying very hard to be positive and determined to get back to at least some sort of normality. I'm going into hospital to hospital to have a biopsy on my right lung in the coming weeks which is pretty scary but I'm hopeful that this will enable the docs will find out what it is. I had an appointment with Rhumatology a few weeks back and it seems I have some anti-bodies in my bloods that shouldn't be there. The doctor has given me a preliminary diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis. It's an auto-immune condition that affects the connective tissue in your body. I have been wondering if there is any connection between this condition and my diabetes, being that they are both auto-immune conditions? If anyone knows/suffers with this and info or advice would be greatly appreciated.Happy Sunday!   x
