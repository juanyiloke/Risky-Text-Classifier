can inhaler be faulty and trigger attack?________________________________________I have had asthma (generally cold triggered, sometimes allergies) for about 15 years or so. I usually get a big trigger every January (tree pollen and mostly a cold on top) so bad I think I have bronchitis. I have gone to the doctor 2-3 times in January and assume it's bronchitis, they send me home to take my inhalers. So, I try to be ready in January! In the last couple weeks I felt a little wheezy, thought this was it, time to start prepping and would do my Symbicort inhaler. When I did it it automatically triggered my lungs to spasm and totally started coughing. I forgot it did this, and the other day I decided to try again and it did it again!My son (same asthma issues) has a cold, and has been doing his inhalers for about a week. He went to do one of them the other day and the same thing happened.I was wondering if I was doing something wrong....or the medicine was bad...or spacer was bad. Has any of you heard of this?I am kind of afraid to take it when I am going to really need it! I have never had this problem before.
