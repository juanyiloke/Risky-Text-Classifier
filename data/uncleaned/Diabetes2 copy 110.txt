Gliclazide confused   I am not very happy on these tablets I have told diabetic nurse that after working very hard to achieve some weight loss over a six month period I was put on these to lower my sugars (8:1) as they were too high (?) I started to put the weight I had lost back on. I stopped taking them and at the next appointment she asked me to give them another chance and suggested weightwatchers may help. I did go back on them weight's increasing again (always been around size 20) and bones are aching always now tired and earlier on today started to feel very strange and very weak took readings and they were 2:4 had something sweet and went to bed. Anyone else had similar experience ?
