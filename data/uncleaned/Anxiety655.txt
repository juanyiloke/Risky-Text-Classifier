Anxiety slowing recovery after week in hospitalFor the last few weeks I've had trouble with my stomach, leading to 6 days in hospital. It wasn't anything serious (small hiatal hernia, g.e.r.d. and some inflammation)As it was quite painful, I haven't been eating properly during that time, and as a result have lost about 20lbs.I had started associating food with pain, and even though this pain is now mostly gone, I still can't seem to bring myself to eat properly. I'm drinking high energy "food-shakes" to try and keep the calories at a reasonable level, but I am still getting very anxious at the thought of eating, which in turn is making my stomach hurt. (I can drink the shakes fast so i don't have a chance to start panicking )How do I stop stressing at the thought of food? I do feel hungry, and do really want to eat, but when I have a plate in front of me I can't make myself eat. I sit there looking at it, getting more and more anxious until my stomach gets so sore i couldn't eat even if I wanted to. My muscles are weakened after too much bed-rest. Because I am not eating properly I hardly have the energy to get up and walk/ exercise. I KNOW I need to get back to a normal eating and exercising routine, I just don't know how to do it. The low energy makes the anxiety so much harder to battle
