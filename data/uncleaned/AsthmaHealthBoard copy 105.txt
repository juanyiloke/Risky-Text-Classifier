Shortness of breath and PFT intepretation?________________________________________I am 37 years old and have had asthma all my life. I have typically managed by asthma through albuterol and Advair off and on. I am very active and exercise at least 5 times a week (mostly running). I ran a couple of half marathons last year and felt like my asthma was under control (although I do find myself using my albuterol more than I should). However, starting in October 2013, I started to feel extremely short of breath with some wheezing. It felt like it started overnight with no triggers. I thought it was a mild flareup and my regular dx gave me a Prednisone pack. With flareups like this in the past, a Prednisone pack typically did the trick. This time it did not. I finally went to a pulmonologist who ordered me a PFT as I had not had one in a number of years. The results were not good. Pulmo said I had poorly managed asthma and results showed a moderate to severe asthma classification. I am copying and pasting my results to see if anyone has insight into my numbers. I know the pulmo was very focused on the FEV1 being so low against predicted and the RV% of 131 showing significant air trapping. My biggest concern is comments that he made that there is a condition called "post infection bronchiolitis" which is an irreversable narrowing of the airways. However, based on my research, you typically would see some sort of infection like fever, cough, etc that would then lead to something like this. I never had that. I am just worried that this shortness of breath may never go away and my FEV may never get to normal. The positive is that I had a pretty good reaction to the nebulizer as shown in the 16% increase in FEV. Any thoughts from anyone out there on the below results?
