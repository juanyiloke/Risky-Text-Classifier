no more psychologistI've cancelled my therapist. I can talk to them until I'm blue in the face but I've realised any difference that is going to be made has to be up to me. I know what to do, I have my tools, I have this website. I just have to apply myself and put it into practice. I'm glad i went. I really I am. But I've gone through the entire process before and there are no magic solutions in doing this again. That's just the tough, nasty reality of depression and anxiety and the negativity that comes with it in my case. I know the root causes. It's up to me to overcome them.
