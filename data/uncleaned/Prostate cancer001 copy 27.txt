Next Post op PSA looming Hi everyone,I've not been on the forum much following my RALP on 1st May this year. The relief of getting it over with and a much needed motorcycling break (6 weeks post op) in the US led to a slight feeling of detachment to PCa.....sort of denial really.On my return form the states I had my first post op PSA test and appointment. PSA was undetectable. Pathology showed PCa to be T3a (upgraded from T2a at diagnosis).Incontinence wasn't really an issue thankfully. I was pretty much dry one month post op. I've had one or two small leaks since but nothing really to speak of.ED is still an issue but things are improving. Generally life is good.At my first post op consultation (first PSA) I was told the next test wouldn't be needed for 4 months (usually three as far as I can tell). When the appointment came through it was in fact over 5 months since my first post op test. At the time it didn't bother me  but as it get closer I (like many others in the same position) am getting more and more anxious about it and have a tendency to think about my own mortality rather too much especially as my cancer was more advanced than I had thought.I am thinking of trying to bring my next appointment forward by a month to get it over with.....or maybe not.My friends and family have been fantastically supportive and will soon have to suffer a month of looking at a hairy top lip for Movember.Since my diagnosis two friends have also found they have PCa. The help and guidance I have had from the online community has really helped me to be able to advise and guide both of them.Thanks everyone
