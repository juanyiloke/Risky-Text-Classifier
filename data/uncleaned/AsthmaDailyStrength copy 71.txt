I had a bad asthma attack the end of Dec. I am still having problems breathing. I have been on steroids and I have been doing a lot of neb treatments. I can't get in to see the doctor until Feb 6. I did go and get a breathing test, which according to the nurse I failed miserably. You would think the doctor would call me or change my meds or try to see me sooner. I am trying to take it easy and stay out of the ER. I am thinking about finding another pulmonolgist. Anybody have any suggestions? I had an asthma attack on Aug. 5th I went through the neb treatments and then a course ofprednisone. I was feeling better and my cough had gotten better. Now my cough is worse I cough so hard it takes my breath away and then I start gasping for breath. Sometimes coughing hard makes me vomit too. I have no fever, I don't really feel bad, it is just this cough. It makes my throat hurt too. I was coughing up yellow stuff now it is clear. Anybody ever had an asthma attack that when into bronchitis? I have never had bronchitis until now.
