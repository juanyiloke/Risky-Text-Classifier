Graduation......What to wear? Need some Fashionista's opinions.by HannaLouiseI'm currently procrastinating taking a break from my uni work and thinking about what the hell I am going to wear for graduation, (I know its like 3 month away) but I was wondering if anyone fashion savvy could give me some help?Unfortunately i have put over 4 stone on since starting uni - from a size 10 to a size 16. So none of my smart dresses left at my parents fit me anymore. And for the past 3 years (especially this year) I have lived in my crusty, holey Slipknot hoodie. I think I have forgotten how to be a girl, and I have also became quite conscious of my weight. (I am at the gym 4/5 times a week for over an hour and walk everywhere, and eat healthy-ish).And to make matters worse my supermodel of a mother showed me the dress she is going to wear, and she looks amazing, she's 48 and has better legs than me! I can't help but feel like I will look like a potato next to her on the big day. So basically I am asking for some sort of advice on what to wear, so I look presentable. Sorry the pics are pretty crap.. Also I am not a bit fan of getting my legs out as they're covered in horrible purple scars. But I don't mind wearing leggings/thick tights I've attached a pic of how I used to look and how I do now after a few pizzas.
