Havin a hard dayHey guys. I am just not in a good place today. I went out last night with my friends and I just felt like I was invisible the whole time. I felt like no body noticed me and I think I drank more than I should have which doesn't make me feel good about myself either. Then I found out today that I think a job that I was applying for was filled. HR has been corresponding with me consistently but they haven't in a week and the job posting is down. i had applied for a job at one location but asked if I could switch my application to a new location where a job opened up because it had more hours available and was a more convenient location. I think if I had just left it alone and kept my application at the first site, I probably would've had a good chance of getting the job. So I'm really mad at myself today. I feel like I ruined my own chance. And now I'm freaking out because I don't know what I'm going to do this summer, I have classes to pay for which are ridiculously expensive, I have 4 exams next week, and on top of it all my body-image is at a low today. I feel like I can't talk to anybody about it right now so I just wanted to reach out to you guys. Any advice on how to stop beating myself up? Cuz I'm not doing well with it right now.
