Interview - What to wear?________________________________________Some guidance please.I'm female, middle-aged and am going for an interview for an admin position in a small company tomorrow. I haven't been for an interview in a LONG time so I haven't a clue what to wear.I have some suits but I've put on quite a bit of weight in the last couple of years so those that fit are, putting it mildly, VERY snug.The alternative is some smart black dresses that I used to wear for work and still wear for formal occasions. I'd cover the dress with a lovely dark coat (tomorrow is supposed to be very cold)I'd feel better in a black dress but wonder if I'd be better off wearing a suit and breathing in deeply for the duration of the interview. Any advice please. Thanks in advance.
