HORMONE HOLIDAYS Well, today, 24th Sept, marks 9yrs 6 months since my very first PSA test in 2005.That came back at 182 and then I was in the whirlwind of scans and treatments.My prognosis was very bad, but here I still am. I firmly believe that intermittent hormone therapy has been my saviour.That and the fact that I was blessed to have no lymph or bone mets despite the T4 tumour.Unbelievably, every scan since 2005 has revealed still no spread there. I'm losing count of how many times I've been on and off hormone therapy, but I do know I'm coming up to a year now without Zoladex.Current PSA is 0.429 and testosterone has risen (very slowly this time) to 3.3I will now watch PSA monthly and if it heads for 10.0 I will dash back to HT. All those years ago I never imagined I'd be still here today. So guys, take heart, stay positive, and most important of all, stay very pro-active in your treatment plans. GeorgeIntermittent Hormone Therapy: 9+ years Well, today, 24th Sept, marks 9yrs 6 months since my very first PSA test in 2005.That came back at 182 and then I was in the whirlwind of scans and treatments.My prognosis was very bad, but here I still am. I firmly believe that intermittent hormone therapy has been my saviour.That and the fact that I was blessed to have no lymph or bone mets despite the T4 tumour.Unbelievably, every scan since 2005 has revealed still no spread there.I'm losing count of how many times I've been on and off hormone therapy, but I do know I'm coming up to a year now without Zoladex.Current PSA is 0.429 and testosterone has risen (very slowly this time) to 3.3I will now watch PSA monthly and if it heads for 10.0 I will dash back to HT.All those years ago I never imagined I'd be still here today.So guys, take heart, stay positive, and most important of all, stay very pro-active in your treatment plans. George
