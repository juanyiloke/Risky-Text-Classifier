FlurHi all,Hope your Mondays are ticking along ok  One of my more free thinking friends sent this to a few of us - The reference to fluoride raising sugar levels in some people & being a link to diabetes, and also countries with fluoride in their water not having less tooth decay, which was the whole point Im sure, aside of the pineal gland article which is a different train of thought altogether.What are your thoughts? - it has made me wonder. Id be keen to hear what other folk make of it all.Many thanks in advance
