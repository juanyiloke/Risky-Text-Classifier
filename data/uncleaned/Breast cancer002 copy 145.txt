Wockhardt brand 20mg Tamoxifen¥	Hi, does anyone know anything about the above only being available now via hospitals?¥	I have been prescribed it since November but when I collected my last repeat prescription i was told it's no longer available on community prescriptions, only hospital ones. My prescription specifically states the brand so they were able to supply double quanity of 10mg ones instead. I checked with 2 other chemists and they all said the same.¥	Has anyone else had this and found out why? Done something about it? I'm doing okay on it and really don't want to change brands but if I have to is there information available about what the 'fillers' are in other ones so i can try and get one that's the same content?¥	Thanks in hope x
