Mod changesOur longest serving mod D'Agger has decided to step down as mod of tGC.ÊHis main contributions to the forum included keeping the average age down by about 30 years, ensuring that an obscure mid table premier league footballer got the fame he deserved and never making it to a tGC beers (which hopefully will be rectified at the next one (date tbd).On behalf of all the mods we would like to thank him for all his help for the last couple (few?) years and wish him well.We would like to welcome ancapailldorcha (from now on known as ACD) who has kindly agreed to give the mod team a dig out. He is already a valuable contributor to the forum and will surely be a valuable addition to the mod team.
