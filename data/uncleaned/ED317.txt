ÊPsych ReferralMy counselor referred me to a psychiatrist this afternoon, and sent forms to my family doctor for psychiatric intervention (whatever that actually means). I'm supposed to see him (my family doctor) first thing in the morning and I'm terrified.ÊI feel like when I go he's going to dismiss me and tell me what I'm thinking: everyone is overreacting. And that scares me, because then he'll send me away and nothing will happen and I'll just be the way I am, case closed. And I can't stay the way I am because there is no way that I can hate myself this much for the rest of my life and there is no way that I can deal with myself that long.ÊEveryone keeps throwing around terms like OCD and 'eating disorder' and I don't know if they're right or not, but I feel like maybe they're not. Maybe they're overreacting. I don't know. Something is wrong, I think, but I don't know- maybe that's not what it is.ÊI'm just scared of the whole situation.ÊI'm scared, mostly, of being turned away and having to continue to deal with this (whatever this is) by myself. I can't do that.
