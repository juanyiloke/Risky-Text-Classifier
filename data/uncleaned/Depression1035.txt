Depression desperation!Im new here, but I just needed this out...I'm so confused but I'm finally admitting to myself today I'm depressed...I know I need to see someone but that is gonna be near impossible today and our local hospital is useless...I feel like I must be the reason my marriage of nearly 6 years is broken down....my husband doesn't appear to care and has been pushing me away (and telling me to stop pushing him away...I'm not though...at least I don't think I am)...I can be curled up on the floor crying an my husband would appear angry that I was crying and ask me "what  are you doing?"but now we are separated....his decision....not mine.....I'm not coping well today....as I realised this morning all our mutual friends appear to be talking to him and ignoring me....I'm feeling so alone...I tried to voice this to my husband when he came to pick up our son and he just looked at me and called me stupid...I can't do anything right anyway!writing this down it seems I've been conditioned into being depressed, and I dunno how much truth there could be to that...I know my side may be bias but I need it out! I feel like I'm eating my time here and I'm just a pain to everyone i just feel like no matter what it's never gonna get better.....I'm gonna be like this forever....4
