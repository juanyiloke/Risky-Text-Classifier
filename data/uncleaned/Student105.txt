Getting someone else to write your dissertation...by CupcakeDollPretty shocking, right? It makes you a lying unfair cheat, and you don't deserve your degree. You deserve to fail.My 'best friend' has done just that. I met her in the first year of university. She's pretty lazy but thankfully very intelligent. She hates university and only did the degree because she had nothing else to do. She's scraped through academically with no motivation. Now we're writing our dissertations, due in only two weeks. She left it until the last minute and stared freaking out. She begged me to show her how to do a literature review but I don't have the time to do that and my own. I recommended she go and look at last year's dissertations in the library and I told her what book to buy which would go through it all step by step. Instead, she approached someone who did the same degree last year and has asked her to do it for her. And the other girl agreed.My friend told both myself and another of our friends in a WhatsApp group what she was doing. She flat out said "if I get caught I'll be chucked out for cheating" and we simply and nicely said "yes, that's cheating". We than got a long, nasty message back. I assume that's her guilt talking.I'm angry because I'm doing all this work and I'm not very good academically. I've struggled this whole degree and I'm still struggling now. But I'm honest and it's all my own hard work. Also, some of my friends have been withdrawn from the university for academic failure. My uni is pretty strict and you can be expelled for simply getting a fail for an assignment. They didn't cheat though. I feel like this isn't fair on them, or me, or anyone who has honestly passed this degree. I want her to get caught. I feel like I've lost my friend already. Should I do something about this? Should I take it further? Would you?
