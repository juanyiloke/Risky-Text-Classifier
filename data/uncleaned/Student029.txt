 Cheating on Courseworkby UniStudent1055Okay, the title of the thread is a little far off the truth but I couldn't think of how to put it. Recently I missed a coursework deadline due to personal circumstances, I informed my personal tutor / the university and submitted an extenuating circumstances form, allowing me to submit the assignment 10 working days after the deadline with no penalty. Upon receiving validation of this I emailed the module leader to let them know it was happening.The problem is that earlier today the module leader posted the solutions to the coursework online, with my extended deadline is later this week.I haven't yet completed the assignment (or looked at the solutions) but I am unsure if it's even worth completing the work as while I haven't looked at the solutions I may be accused of it making the work I do toward the assignment basically pointless. I am unsure how to proceed and wondered if this had happened to anyone else or people know what the process that happens with this is.
