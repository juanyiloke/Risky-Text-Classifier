Êscared to driveAbout 2 months ago, when i was driving my car and was trying to take a turn, a speeding bike came scratched along my car and fell down, the driver of the bike was fine but was talking aggressively like it was my mistake and called about 15 of his friends , while the pillion rider was in acute pain. I had told i will take care of the medical expenses of this pillion rider and take care of his bike because of i scared of the number of people and them getting aggressive.I had taken care of the medical expenses of this pillion rider and i was told he had no injury and nothing to worry about by the doctor, at the same time i thought it was their mistake so i didnt pay for thier bike expenses and didn't pick their calls up.Now, I am scared to even get on my car and drive, even when i drive i tend to look at the mirror to check if i am being followed by the mob for money even after 2 months from the accident.I dont know how to over come it whilst my parents and friends say it is unlikely that you will be followed and get on with your life and it happens. I am still scared as if the mob is going to attack me for cheating them according to their senses.I wish you could give me some suggestion or tips to over come this kind of fears and help me get back in my lifeTHanks
