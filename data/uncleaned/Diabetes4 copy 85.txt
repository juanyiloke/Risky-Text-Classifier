Radio programme re: weight issuesHi allI was listening to local radio this lunchtime - turned it on about 12.40 and there was a chap on who'd had bariatric surgery explaining what he'd been through.  He was followed by an interview with a surgeon who performs this surgery talking about it.  It would seem that new facts have come to light and one interesting thing he was saying was that anyone who had a BMI at any time of over 40 would not ever be able to lose weight naturally.  He also had some other interesting views on it.You can hear it here http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0295g2f  As I said, I came into it 40 minutes in so I don't know what was said prior to that.
