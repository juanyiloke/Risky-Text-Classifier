Êfeeling betterHello everyone, I have recently changed my psychiatrist and he prescribed me Sizodon plus(anti psychotic) and Lorazapam (Anxyolitc). I was on olanzapine but it didn't help as I was having multiple psychotic episodes per week.Anyway, after taking my first dose of Sizodon I felt much better calm. Now, my only problem is that I feel like I have forgotten every skill that I had learned, I also constantly have this feeling that I am not good enough. I am also afraid to see my old friends, I am afraid of social situation. Now, my question is will these current symptoms go away with time or should I ask my doctor to prescribe me some medication to help me with my social situation. or should I see a therapist to overcome my social anxiety... it is getting worse day by day, I am grateful that I am not having any psychhotic episode recently. But my social anxiety is really taking a toll on me. I am so terrified of social situation and seeing my old friends that I go out of my way to avoid them. I know it sounds silly and I should just snap out of itm but I can't , I feel helpless and hopeless and stupid when I am interacting with other people. I am not taking Lorezapam because it makes me feel dizzy, but should I take it? will this work in reducing social anxiety?
