Will need to leave job in a few months - advice needed________________________________________Hello,This is a sort of "good problem" but I could really do with some advice.This week my OH was offered a PhD in Vancouver which starts in September 2015 so we're going to make the move in July/August. The company I work for at the moment is a subsidiary of a large multinational which actually owns another similar company in Vancouver. We quite often collaborate on projects with this sister company and it's not unusual for some of their staff to do stints in our office and vice-versa. My contract is directly with my current employer, not the large multinational and I've been with them for about 20 months.My plan has always been to talk to my director and essentially get him to recommend me to the other guys in Vancouver. The thing is that I'm not sure if it's better to do this now or wait until nearer the time I would have to give my one month's notice. Doing it now seems better because...1. It allows lots of time for my director to talk to theirs 2. It allows lots of time for me to hand over my work to someone else where necessary (I've been working on the same project for the entire time I've been here so that's quite a lot)3. It's quite likely that some of their senior staff will be in our offices at some point over the coming months which would be opportunity for a chat/interview4. I was actually asked at my last annual review if I would be interested in a secondment to the Vancouver office should they win certain work so it seems like I should mention the fact that I want to move there!The only thing I'm hesitant about is the fact that I would effectively be giving them notice many months before I plan to leave. I'm a little worried that they will be less inclined to give me interesting work, be less inclined to pay for training, be generally not that interested in me etc. etc.Any thoughts?Thanks
