HELP NEEDED! What med(s) work best for you??Hi Guys,I'm currently 2 years since my initial diagnosis of schizophrenia. At first I took medication for about 4 months (Zyprexa), then I stopped taking it for a year. Exactly 1 year after my initial onset I had a relapse, so I went back on Zyprexa and had horrible side effects. I was highly sedated, sleeping 12 hours a day or more, had erectile dysfunction (NOT fun at all), and gained 20 lbs. I then switched to Abilify to escape those side effects but had terrible insomnia and did not sleep for 3 weeks. I am currently on Risperdal now and am experiencing the same side effects as from Zyprexa! Weight gain, high sedation, and erectile dysfunction.My question to you guys out there is what medication (medications) work best for you? Are you able to function day in and day out without sleeping too much? Are you able to hold down a full time job while medicated? Are you gaining a lot of weight? Do you have any sexual dysfunction?All i want is to be stable, sleep 6-9 hours a day, and have my normal sexual functioning back. Any help is needed and greatly appreciated, thanks!!
