Scared I have lung cancerSo about 3 weeks ago i went to the doctor because of my allergies. My nose kept running and I had a small cough that started at night when i was playing video games. I went and he said I had a sinus infection and gave me amoxicillin. About 2 weeks later the sinus infection had cleared but the cough didnt. So a week later I went back to the doctor and he listened to my lungs and he said everything sounded clear. You have a viral cough that has a minimum lasting time of 4-6 weeks. He then prescribed me an inhaler of albuterol. I have chest pain at the bottom of my ribs on both sides and some lower back pain. Sometimes Iwhen I run my chest feels tight. ( i dont know if it i just from coughing alot. COughing is always the worst when I wake up. Sometimes in the morning I cough up like yellow mucus but it is only in the morning. I have not coughed up blood and I know that is one of the most common symptoms of lung cancer. I am just scared I have it. I am 21 years old. I smoke hookah but no that much maybe once every week. I havent done it since I have had the cough. It is like a dry cough. Please help!
