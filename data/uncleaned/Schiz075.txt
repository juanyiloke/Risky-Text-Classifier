Misunderstanding Words?by Hawk98 » Tue Nov 11, 2014 6:43 pmI believe I do have Schizophrenia, I was not diagnosed by a pro, but I have a ton of the symptoms. But why I began this topic is for the reason of my misunderstanding of words. I don't mean, finding an underlying meaning in what people say to me, which I also do, but at random times this thing happens where someone will say something to me like "I like milk" and I will hear "Run for the hills" or just something totally made up. One time I was with my cousin and we were going to get ice cream and he said he wanted the box of "cookie dough" and I heard "plinkoax" and I was looking for that kind of ice cream and he was like "this one" and then grabbed it himself. And that day I misunderstood about 5-6 words. It happens alot to me. Or even written words get misunderstood. I was looking at a sign the other day and it said "Food" then it kept changing on me to something like "Fooo" "Pooo" "Pood" "Feeo" "Peed" etc. Like the letters were morphing. Anyone else experience something like this?
