ÊVent - Anxiety :(Feeling so desperate at the moment. I have moved from my parents house in Scotland to central England to try and move on in my life. Where I lived was rather remote and didn't have much to offer. As I have contacts down here and its a busier place I thought it could perhaps move me on. It wasn't a hurried decision and was all well thought out. However I'm just struggling so much to go out and do basic day to day things. The streets are much busier and intimidating down here and I feel watched or that people are laughing at how anxious I look when out in public.ÊI sometimes feel I just want to go back to my parents and live there, but I would feel like a failure and it would reinforce that I can never stick to anything because Anxiety screws everything up for me eventually. I have tried living alone before and it didn't work out, I have tried college courses and dropped out and the list goes on for things I have dropped out of. I have just left a trail of letting people down and dropping out of things because of my anxiety. I'm 24 years old and really feel desperate to improve my life, but its seems impossible when I can't even go out in public without feeling paranoid. I also have Aspergers syndrome and my Anxiety has been very very resistant to CBT and SSRI medication.ÊThis is just a vent.
