  This cured me from depression________________________________________Hey!  I tried almost every medication and sure they did help. At least for a while. Then i got an advice to read about meditation. Practised it for a few days and gave up. This is new age bs of course i was thinking.. But the person said it is very common to give up because people with depression and anxiety may have to "work" more to master it.Ok..then....I continued and after a few weeks of daily practise i noticed my minds chatter suddenly stopped. In that silence there was no depression or anxiety at all. Just bliss. Yes really bliss! Not just lack of depression. Wooow...amazing i thought. I can go to that bliss whenever i want to meditate and that is such a huge relief for me. To just know it is possible to "escape". I am not yet able to be there in every day life. Need a silent room etc.Read and read about what this bliss is for months after that and still do.I know there is a connection to chakras and "chi" or whatever you want to call it. Guess there are many names.Just wanted to tell you guys about it.
