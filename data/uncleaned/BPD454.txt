ÊDo NON BPDs believe BPDs cant help their emotions?This is somewhat a update to my previous post. I kept doing the push and pull game and was cordial moving on after my ex was dating someone for a little bit, while we were still talking. I said we need a break and she agreed, and said she just needed time and adored me and wants me to be happy. Well, that should have been a great feeling right?ÊSo here is how it ended. About 6 hrs later it hit me and I started to resent her from moving on with another guy and my rejection turned to hurt and I text her letting her know she hurt me for moving on so fast, and that she was never serious about us, etc. I said mean things. I instantly regretted it. My emotions spun so far out in emotiotional mind so fast that that I COULD NOT get back. I knew what I was doing, and just couldnt stop! I knew I would drive the nail in the coffin and I did it anyway. This came after a week of reading, studying mindfullness, letting go. I was working all the time on myself. Still I couldnt not help it.ÊDoes anyone believe this happens? I still say as much as a non BPD cant fully grasp what its like. Its very painful knowing we hurt the ones we love, and the regret can be even harder.
