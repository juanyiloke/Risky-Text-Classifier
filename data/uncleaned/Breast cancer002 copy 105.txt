Joint pains¥	Hello all, I'm new to this sort of thing but thought I would try to get some advice from other people in my situation. After my surgeries & radiotherapy I was originally prescribed anastrozole to stop estrogen production but the side effects were bad with joint pain & stiffness & even bone pain which I didn't think was an actual thing! They changed me onto tamoxifen & the pains have eased but my joints are still bothering me. When I get out of bed in the morning I am like an 80 year old. Nothing against 80 year olds but I've got another 30 years til I get there.¥	I do walk every day with my dog so I'm trying to keep things from stiffening up but I can even feel soreness in my fingers whilst I am typing. Anyone else had this please? Any handy hints??
