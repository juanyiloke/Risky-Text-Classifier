I do not want to die, I just do not want to live with this constant angst within.I am not afraid of what lies in the afterworld, I'm afraid of what I am leaving behind in this world.I cannot abandon those I love, yet I am not near them whence alive anyhow.I am not living right now anyways.I have been in hospital for over three months now- two months spent in a mental health clinic due to my depressive disorder and eating disorder.ÊSometimes it is clear as day why I am still fighting to beat my demons, and sometimes the future is so obscure and seems so bleak I lose sense of hope and yearn to keep carrying on.I find it hard to touch base with realism at times as well. I have not dissociated completely - I still recognize I am an animated carcass - yet I cannot grasp the concept of why people are always pushing me to keep living. I want to cave to the darkness, I want my heart to freeze over, I want to leave the earth.ÊSome peoples words have had grand effects on my decision making. After many failed attempts due to last minute regrets; people started realising my daily torment I were hiding from everyone."You are so beautiful and kind hearted," I had heard this line over and over again; from different people in different words. Yet all I could think was "Yes maybe through your eyes I am beautiful, that's how I wish to stay at my funeral. Yes maybe you perceive me as kind hearted, it is me over compensating for when I am able to take that final step into self murder."I am not living in these artificial atmospheres. And when I am freed from here, out on the streets I won't be living either because deep down I am still deteriorating.
