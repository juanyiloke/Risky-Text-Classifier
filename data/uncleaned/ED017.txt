How do I get past this?I've just recently been diagnosed with anorexia, but I've been battling with eating disorders ever since I was a young child. I've never been satisfied with myself or appearance, and I'm trying my best to overcome these thoughts that are consuming me. I'm currently being treated as an outpatient, but I'm not sure if it's enough help for me. I'm trying to recover for my parents and my sister... I have to get healthy again because I have to live up to their expectations and be a "good" role model for my sister; but, if I eat, I lose confidence and hope. When I do not eat or fast for long periods of time, I feel great about myself and I feel better.I've been meditating, but it hasn't been living up to my expectations. I am attempting to be more open and honest with my mother and my therapist, which has not helped as much as I think it should, too. My mother is taking my disorder upon herself and believes that it is her fault because she struggles with some mental illness as well. With her thinking that, I can't help but feel guilty and I end up hating myself even more.Im trying not to relapse with self-harm again, but I dare say it is tempting.So my question becomes: how do I get past this stage of working toward recovery? What are coping methods that have helped you through this stage?Thank you,-Ashton
