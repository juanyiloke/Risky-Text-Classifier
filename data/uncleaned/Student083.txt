Dropping out before exams - university.by Chrollo-LucilferI'm a second year student with exams coming up in May. I wanted to drop out since first year as I wasn't enjoying my course at all and even with attainment of a degree I wouldn't like the work I was doing. However, I carried on due to family pressure.Now in second year, I've been scraping 2.2s in my coursework. After a lot of thought, I wish to drop out and work for a year or two and then redo my A-levels picking up science subjects and pursue medicine in my mid 20s. I knew I wanted to do this course for a while, but felt that it was impossible due to my a-levels being a mix of humanities and social sciences as well as family pressure on the very idea of confronting them with this news.I've sometimes tried to bring up my distaste for my course, but my parents always try to persuade me that it's the right thing - never succeeding. My solution to this problem was going to be me telling my parents that if I got a 2.2 for second year I would drop out, telling them I had done my best and I just couldn't do it. Then pursuing the course I like.However, I'm worried that if I fail when I apply to another university again and they have my record, it would reflect badly on me suggesting I'm not serious about studying. So I was curious as to whether dropping out now would be best?Just to sum it up: I dislike my course, I want to know if dropping out would be seen in better light then failing.
