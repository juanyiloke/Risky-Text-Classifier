What would make our lives easier?My grandson is doing a project at Uni on the aging society and looking into designs that (without us realising we actually need them?!) would make our day to day lives easier....whether that be connected to communication, shopping, bathing...basically anything that would assist 'a certain age group'Ê.................anyone out there have any problems that they think are not already being addresses or have problems with basic adaptations that just dont do what they are supposed to??
