ÊFeeling uselessI haven't done the work I need to do for Wednesday. I had two weeks and I did nothing, just sat and looked at the computer all blank. I had a panic attack the other night, where I was just shaking and couldn't move or talk. It's so scary, I hate them. I'm scared I'm going to let everyone down. I'm scared because I sh'd and my oh will be upset if they find out. I need to keep the anxious down or I'll have flashbacks. I need to be alone in a room with two guys on Wednesday and not sound like an idiot. I'm scared about that too.
