relapsinghi, hopefully this is the right forum for this. I was treated for an eating disorder in high school, and since then I've considered myself more or less recovered, other than some restrictive behaviors/pesky image issues I hung on to. now I'm 29 and in grad school, and I've been responding to the stress of higher education in a myriad of ways. guess what my latest solution seems to be! yup, I find myself moving towards bigger and bigger restrictions. this is pretty scary for me because I cannot afford the mental fogginess that goes with this with all the work I have to do. (not to mention my research requires considerable physical exertion starting in late April.) but the more I think about it the logical reasons I shouldn't be relapsing, the more I'm drawn to the feeling of numbness that comes with inadequate intake. I can only see a therapist every other week and I'm worried that's not going to be enough to start turning this around. does anyone have any advice on things that help keep them from relapsing? thank you.
