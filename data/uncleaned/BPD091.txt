why do i like danger? triggerby venomxo » Tue May 26, 2015 10:04 pmSo i have a really bad habit of being really drawn to dangerous people and situations. I've gotten in cars with strangers multiple times which led to an assault last year which was followed by a relapse of self harming that lasted til this March. Im also really experimental with sex and drugs. Every one worries about me and i feel like i drive them away subconsciously cuz im addicted to tragedy and being hurt and a big part of me wants to die young and looks for terrible things to happen to me.By the same coin happiness is challenging. Its like its easier to feel pain than happiness. Sometimes it gets better and i wise up and i just wanna be happy but something always triggers me back into a downward spiral. Why am i like this? How can i cope?
