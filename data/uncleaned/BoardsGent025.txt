The popularity and ethics of PUAs and similar communitiesI’ve noticed that the pickup artist (PUA) community seems to be becoming more and more mainstream lately. I’ve no interest in it myself thought I do find the rise in popularity intriguing. From what I know, PUA involves honing a routine and attempting to engage women in conversation with the aim of a one-night stand or a casual fling. It seems to work on a subset of women, just as some men can be wound around the little fingers of some women. From the ads I’ve seen, the PUAs know this and encourage their acolytes to treat approaching women as a numbers game and so they approach as many women as possible.There seems to be a growing amount of BS emanating primarily at least from the US aimed at young men, specifically those who’ve yet to experience a relationship or any sort of romantic interaction with the opposite sex. Most of this portrays women quite negatively and the PUA sites seem to be no exception. Women are strongly encouraged today in both professional and personal endeavours, which is fantastic. There doesn’t seem to be any similar message for young men leaving a void which ends up being filled by PUAs, “red pillers” and misogynists in general. I find it disturbing that such groups prey on the loneliness of young men spreading this message that women are little more than targets and prizes rather than people worth knowing. I was offered a free workshop myself once. The idea of putting up pretence just to attain one-night stands has no appeal to me. The PUAs fill a role in an ethically questionable manner. However, there seems to be no alternate message for young men which likely explains it’s growing popularity.Do ye agree? Any thoughts?
