Honest discussion about SC, Alcohol, and Drugsby crazysurvival » Sun Apr 26, 2015 10:27 pmI sense I will get removed from this forum for this topic, probably due just to my honesty and my schizophrenia.I did attend Alcoholics Anonymous until I knew they were gaslighting me and that they were shape shifters. I did clear my mind, I worked the steps, I tried my hardest.Schizophrenia and drug use seem to go hand in hand, and that is true in my life.I smoked pot -until- recently I realized that it did not relieve my PTSD. I quit. I will never smoke pot again until I know that I am completely safe from the shapeshifters.Let me just share, the shape shifters molested me when I was very young, and helpless. They gave me pot when i was about five years old. When I smoked it then I was outside of my reality and I was at peace. When I smoked, I could remove myself from this reality and be calm. Recently I have been so abused by them so much that pot doesn't help anymore. I was in an abusive relationship. Now I just live alone with PTSD and am looking at just hitting the streets and focusing on food and a place to sleep.When I don't drink, I am just depressed. I have no options. Everybody is out to get me. I can not be interdependent. I will be abused at every job, and even if I just try to buy cigars at a store, they will abuse me. There are shape shifters and body jumpers everywhere. This must be a video game where humans are abused.I have so much more to share, but this is becoming a 'too long, didn't read' (tldr) type of post and I would be happy to give feed back if anybody is interested in hearing more of my story. It is long, complex, and detailed. With compassion and empathy, I say take care!
