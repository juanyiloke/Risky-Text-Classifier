Should I be worried still? Hi. I have had various symptoms since having flu a few months ago. The main symptoms are breathlessness, a cough, sore throat and tickly feeling that comes and goes in my upper back. I was referred to a pulmonologist who performed a physical e am of me and a spirometery test. He said that I was definitely not asthmatic but he rather thinks I'm suffering with post viral fatigue. I any help but believe that my symptoms are still consistent with asthma and it makes me very anxious. Should I believe the pulmonologist?
