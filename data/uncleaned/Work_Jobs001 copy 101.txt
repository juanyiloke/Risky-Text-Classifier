Pregnant in new job________________________________________I started a new job 4 months ago and I'm now 11 weeks pregnant. It's a medium sized company but sort of family run, no one has contracts and there was no mention of probation period etc. They seem to go through a lot of staff, if they're not happy with someone they'll just get rid that day and that's it!Despite that, it's actually a nice place to work and I'm getting on well the boss who seems very happy with me.But now I need to tell him I'm pregnant and I dont think they'll be impressed. It wasn't planned at all but I feel really bad and I'm afraid they might use it as an excuse to get rid of me. I was going to ask for some feedback on my work before I tell him so he couldn't then turn around and say there was something wrong with it after I tell him?Is there anything else I can do to protect myself?
