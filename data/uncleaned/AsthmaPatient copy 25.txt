Asthma getting bad around cat but not allergic.  10  I recently took in a cat and since doing so my asthma symptoms have gotten worse. They're not terrible, but my chest is often tight and I'm taking my inhaler far more regularly than before the cat came. Before getting the cat I had an allergy test to make sure things should be ok and it came out negative for cat allergies. The only thins it came out positive for were house dust, dust mites and some form of grass.Does anyone know why my asthma might be getting worse even though I don't have an allergy to the cat? I've cleaned my house like crazy and can't believe that the number of dust mites would increase so quickly and have this much of an effect, my asthma was relatively fine before.Any help or advice would be much appreciated.
