Britain is in crisisBritain is in crisis - few have faith in our system of government.- 80 per cent said that the parliamentary system was not working.- 62 per cent said MPs were in politics to serve their own interests.- 76 per cent said that MPs cannot be trusted.- 85 per cent wanted an independent body to monitor MPs.Do we need a new constitution, that is in line with other modern European states?Do we need a bill of rights, that clearly sets out this country's ideas of freedom?Do we need a new democratic system entirely, one perhaps more in line with other more successful European, Asian or North America governments?
