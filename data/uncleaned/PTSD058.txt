So Much PainI don't know what is worse. Feeling this all the time or being dropped in without any notice. Fully invested into something....I have an idea what but no idea what the cause. There is so much pain. I just keep crying, silent tears as always. I realized very young that I wasn't to make noise when I cried.ÊI know I need a therapist for this. I don't have that option right now. It started with talking about a suitcase. That is all. So.much.pain. I want to crawl out of my skin. Literally. I used to want to die. It is no wonder. I can't describe how this feels. It is like a cancer. I can't get this out of me. And the slightest of cues cranks me up so badly it is like night and day. CLICK. Switch. Self confidence to BAM - whatever this is. So much pain.ÊI get it. It has anything to do with moving. Even a subtle nuance. Figuring out where I will 'stay'. Just a slight indecision throws me close to psychotic. I can't express it. Is that what psychotic is? I need out of my skin. I literally need to crawl out of my skin. I have no idea what to do about this. This goes so deep.
