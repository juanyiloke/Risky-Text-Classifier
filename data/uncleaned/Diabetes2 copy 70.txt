Renal Failure after Angiography   Hi this is Isha. My father is 63 years old diabetic patient. We have a strong family history of diabetes. He is suffering from Diabetes since his early thirties. Few days back, we got his ECG done and found out that he has a Heart Problem. Doctors Recommended Angiography for that. Before Performing Angiography, Doctors performed few tests, His creatinine level was 2.9 and he generally has a foamy urine for few years, they said that the Angiography was risky, so they waited for two days and tried to bring the creatinine level down. When it came to 2.2, they performed Angiography. Two stents were also inserted. That Angiography Dye adversely affected the Kidneys. His Creatinine rose to around 6. And his urination is less. Doctors said that in order to remove that Dye, They need to perform Dialysis. Yesterday was his third dialysis. He is undergoing dialysis from three consecutive days. Doctors said that the same has to be performed for 1 to 1.5 months, twice or thrice a week and right now his kidneys are not functioning properly.After that they will re assess the situation and will see if he requires further Dialysis or not. Please let me know the percentage chances of kidney revival and what diet should he have ?
