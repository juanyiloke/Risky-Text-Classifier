Am I allowed to join - or would you prefer this group to be just patients?¥	Hi everybody,¥	just to explain, I'm in a proper pickle with my emotions today as my twin told me yesterday she is going in for a lumpectomy on Thursday.  Probably looking at radiotherapy thereafter.  ¥	She is so precious to me and I feel so lost as to how to a) help her and b) help myself through this.  I'm a mess and I need to get some answers as soon as I can - I'm one of those who needs as much information as possible to help me cope.¥	If there is somewhere else I should be posting, please let me know.  Don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable.¥	Thanks for any replies
