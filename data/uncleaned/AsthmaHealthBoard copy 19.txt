Exercise improves my Asthma symptoms!________________________________________Just wondering if anybody with asthma feels relief when exercising. I have had asthma for several years and it has recently been so bad that l have had to take time of work. I take up 6. - 8 puffs a day of symbicort, 2-3 puffs of ventilation a day, daily singulair and Prednisolone for when it's really bad. Everything l have read and researched informs me that asthma should get worse when exercising and may indeed 'set it of' however theonly time l breath properly is when l am exercising (usually brisk walking) wondering if anybody else is the same. I am starting wonder if l have asthma or something else?
