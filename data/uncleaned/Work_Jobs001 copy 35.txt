Manual Handling in Work________________________________________Hi Guys,I work in a retail store and a couple of days back I has to lift a very heavy bag from a shopping trolley. We normally lift boxes / bags in work but this time around as it was from a trolley, a very bad pain developed in my shoulder and is still there two days later.We were never given any manual handling guidelines or training. Does the employer have to provide this? Also if there is a permanent injury, will the employer be liable?Thanks.
