are there different levels to devaluation/splitting? TWby zgzyzgxgx » Wed May 27, 2015 11:14 pmNew here don't know if this is the right section but I've read that people with BPD have black and white thinking no grey... In terms of splitting, If someone continually presses your buttons or triggers you can you even if its by accident. Do you just like vs hate or is it resentment , anger , revenge. Can people just essentially just keep being painted blacker if they continue to try and apologize or "fix" a perceived abandonment or betrayal? Sorry if I triggered anyone or used the wrong terms
