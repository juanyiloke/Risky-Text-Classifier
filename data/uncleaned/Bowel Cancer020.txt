UpdateHi AllIt's been a few weeks since I last posted. The quick version is that I came down with pneumonia about three weeks ago and to be honest it's been a long slog with lots of ups and downs ever since.I did not have any of the usual symptoms, no cough or cold...only pains in my ribs and a temperature.So, off I trundled to the local A and E department ....they were very quick to treat me...but sent me home with only oral antibiotics even though they knew of my cancer history. The next week and a half were, to be blunt , a nightmare. I ended up back in the same hospital and actually got worse instead of better....gall bladder inflammation ......elevated temperature, etc, etc. it was over a week before they put me on IV antibiotics.......After two weeks of what was like something out of a bad black comedy I ended up being released and checking into the hospital I usually use as part of my cancer treatment. Needless to say I'm much better and should be released by the end of this week.I've always maintained that the NHS do a good job given how much pressure they are under, but I must admit I was knocked off my feet by some of the care given.....not just to me, but in general to others on my ward....it's really shaken my confidence, more than I ever imagined.I need to get better to start my chemo cycles again.....I've now gone 5 weeks without it and I am normally on a two week routine.Take care and best of luck to everyone.NickGrade three cancer...Hello. I've had my first follow up appointment since my operation in November. It didn't go as well as I'd hoped. The prof told me that I had grade three cancer which I believe is the most aggressive form.He also told me that he was "concerned" about me! Not what I wanted to hear but at least I know. He doesn't want to see me again until April followed by my scan in May.I would have thought he may want to see me sooner if I had an aggressive form of cancer.Nick
