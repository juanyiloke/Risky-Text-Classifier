Êilli cant keep anything down hence i havent taken my meds for over a week since last thursday.....my voices have come back especially 'hannah' and she now saying meds are poison. plucked up the courage to ring my care co-ordinator explained to him how ill i have been and cant keep the meds down....he told me to make doctors appointment as a week is too long to have been this ill not being able to keep anything down and he asked me to ring him back once i have seen the doctor.....got appointment for 2 oclock this afternoon....he said to try and take a little of my medication with a fizzy drink so that it disolves quicker...anyone heard of this being done have you tried doing this?my paranoia has come back....i didnt think i would get voices back this quick or my paranoia being back like this...is this normal? i am supposed to be taking 500mg quetiapine, 5mg haloperidol. i am scared going the doctors at 2pm today in fear of being followed....my doctors surgery is 10min walk away but i am really terrified in going out in fear of someone seeing me and making fun of me as i am talking back at hannah one of the voices thats talking to me making nasty comments and telling me to do bad things....i hate me
