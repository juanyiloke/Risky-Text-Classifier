Idk what else to think, anxiety? please readhey guys im pretty new to this forum and id really like to hear opinions of whats going on with me. ive even done the mistake to google it and my mind literally at the point where i think i have about 10 different diseases and or illnesses.Êsome quick information about me i am a 21 year old male and i was diagnosed with (GAD) generalized anxiety disorder in june after having 3 panic attacks in one day. and for that i take xanax .25mg to help with stressheres where it gets weird. following the night after my birthday august 29 i felt shitty , my body ached, my stomach was empty and i had a hangover. my friend that was with me that night said that i had thrown up about 9 times and then passed out. the part that started to worry me was that a few days after i woke up in the crack of dawn shaking and trembling. my body felt hot and i was sweating a little bit but i didnt have a fever. slowly but surely i then started worrying alot more because it kept happening, then i slowly began to lose my appetite, had trouble sleeping at night, had constant worries and fears that i had some disease. its now october and after visiting the doctor twice and the health department once they have said that everything seems to be normal with me other than blood pressure being high (im sure its stress related) and my potassium is low (3.4) should be in the 3.5-5.0 region. i even went and got tested for HIV and other STD's and they all came back negative. my symptoms nowadays is that my body aches from time to time, and anytime i eat or drink something my body will start feeling really hot and i'll sweat causing me to get dehydrated either in the evening or night time.Ê could this all be anxiety and stress related? someone please help me before i lose my mind.
