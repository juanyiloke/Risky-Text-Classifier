Another hospital fiasco.We turn on the tv news this evening to learn that yet another company, which took over the catering contract at the Leicester Royal Infirmary today, managed to [censored] things up with not only meals turning up hours late but some not at all! The outcome was that many patients could not be given their medication because they had had nothing to eat. Other hospital staff were left without food too. I dread hearing what is going to happen tomorrow!
