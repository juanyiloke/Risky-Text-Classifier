Physical problems during the early stages of anorexia recoveryAfter a long battle with my eating disorder this year I was diagnosed with anorexia. After a number of months of restricting and quiet a rapid weight loss things reached crisis point and I have recently started on a more recovery focused eating plan. The only thing is, now I have started to eat a more varied diet I have begun to feel really quiet ill. I am constantly cold (a lot more so than I was when restricting), I feel exhausted and seem to be sleeping tonnes and perhaps the worst symptom I ache ALL over. Has anyone else expereinced this? Is it normal and how long will it last? Any advice or info would be greatly recieved
