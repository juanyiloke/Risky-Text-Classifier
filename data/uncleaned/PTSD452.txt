ÊAdvice PleaseOn Sunday I have to be in a situation that will set off my two main triggers. I can't handle having people walking or being behind me and I have to go to an assembly of about 1000 people in an auditorium. Because of the program it is expected to sit still, quiet, and follow along. We are in this circumstance for about 7-8 hours. I have downloaded visualization/guided meditation stories and have collected several things I can use for grounding.ÊDo any of you know of anything that works for more than a short term solution? When you know you can't escape your trigger?
