ÊFeeling lost over anorexiafeel so empty and lost. have been diagnosed with anorexia this year though i have had it for 5 years. i have also been diagnosed this year with severe depression and PTSD.i have my first appointment with the eating disorders team and getting worried in case they dont believe me. i worry im not thin enough. i don't know what to expect from the meeting getting really stressed about it.I feel so low i wish i could just eat and not have to think all the time about what and when im eating. im so tired. sometimes i wonder if its worth even fighting
