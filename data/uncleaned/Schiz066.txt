Symptoms worsening after starting medsby StephieWeee » Sun Mar 01, 2015 12:09 amHi all!So when I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, I was put on 80mg of Latuda and Welbutrin. Before the meds and diagnosis, I was not experiencing visual hallucinations and only hearing voices once every few months. Since starting the meds, I've been having visual and auditory hallucinations very often and they are increasing daily. I'm going to the doctor on Monday to discuss my treatment plan and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. Anyone have the same issues at some point? Any tips or suggestions on meds I should try or anything I should tell my doc?
