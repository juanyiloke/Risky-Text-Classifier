Head. Wall. BangSo, I changed my quick acting insulin. One unit for every 10 grams (was on one to 7 in morning and one to 9 rest of time) and 1 unit to bring down 3 reading levels (was on one to one). Haven't had a hypo today. But I've been running high all day. Lowest it got to was 10.2 just before lunch. Otherwise ive been running between 12 and 15. I'm desperately trying to resist the urge to inject a load of insulin onto me to correct. That's how I've been having my average three hypos a day. Any suggestions? Diabetic nurse said to keep it how it is for a few days to settle. I am feeling very nervous about it though. People always say it's the prolonged high sugars that cause the damage.Repeat prescription messed up oopsJust looked on line to check that prescription ready to pick up. Request denied on test strips, insulin and steroids.So rang surgery prescription line to ask if there was a reason for killing me off.  Seems as if my GP hasn't quite got the hang of the new computer system yet so messed up.Lovely lady on the phone said very sorry about that I will sort it now for you.User error is to blame.How nice was that? No drama, just an apology and righted then and there for me.
