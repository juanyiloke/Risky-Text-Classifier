Disputed Maternity Pay________________________________________Hi,I am with my current employer for 10+ years. They were taken over 2 years ago by a sister company. Previous employees from my original company were paid maternity pay, however I have just been informed that I will not be. I was of the understanding that I would be paid.While it is not in my contract to be paid, could I have a case due to bullying/victimisation?I was over-looked for promotion without interview a few months ago, and voiced my concerns at the time also (before pregnancy)Do I have any legal stance here, or is it a case of trying to appeal to their better nature.Thanks!
