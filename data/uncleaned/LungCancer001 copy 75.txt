Worried about lung cancer at 21...Hey everyone- I am a 22 y/o female who has never smoked in my life. I unfortunately, am also a hypochondriac.  Several months ago I started noticing shortness of breath. It was attributed to a pre-existing heart condition. When my heart condition got treated I felt better , the shortness of breath did not go away.It's 6 or 7 months later. For the past 2 months I have had severe pain in my neck between my shoulder blades. I've lost about 15 pounds. (110 lbs to 95 lbs- which I'mHoping is depression?!) I've had a c spine mri, a c and t spine xray, a chest xray, a barium swallow for reflux and an abdominopelvic ct scan all normal. My shortness of breath is getting worse, the weakness is getting worse, I have no appetite, and I'm feeling weaker and weaker. Even my favorite foods make my stomach turn.I am fortunate to have an excellent PCP who is very thorough in her investigations. Because I have multiple health problems, it's hard to sort this out. I've also had blood work.Since nearly everything has been ruled out, I'm scared I'm seriously at risk for lung cancer. I had a lot of radiation exposure as a child and I'm worried that's coming back to be a problem now. Is there any chance I'm just being overly concerned?
