Will I reach my predetermined potential height?So I had anorexia for around a year from the age of 13 and 9 months until about 14 and 10 months, I know, prime growing time right  . I am also a boy which you probably weren't expecting (I think it was more an excessive compulsive thing than anorexia or body image either way I was dumb). I am currently 180cm which I know isn't exactly short but I was meant to be 6'2 or even taller (177cm at 13 and 10 months).Anyway for a year after that I was about 60-63kg which is 7-10 under what I should have been, 70kg, especially seeing as I am not a small frame. Only now I weigh what I should have, this is because no one really told me what I should regain to, however, I still had a BMI within range of healthy, granted not by much (had very skinny legs and 19bmi or something, probably meant for small framed people like africans). Anyway I was wondering if I grew properly in that year where I was way too skinny but within BMI and maintaining somewhat, and also just turning 16 last week, if I still have a chance to grow all that height I lost back from the first year (and potentially the second), now that I am a perfect normal weight and am drinking lots of milk.
