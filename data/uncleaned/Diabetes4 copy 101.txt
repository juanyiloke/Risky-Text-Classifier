change of medicationHithis visit to the endo has started a couple of topics from me -- other one in insulin pumpingI have had an ACE cough and associated catarrh  at back of throat now for 5 1/2 years.various attempts to get rid including antibiotics , steam inhaling , change of medication ( to Losartan approx 2 1/2 years ago )nothing has worked so latest changes - to Ibresartan 300mg and also stopping the 75mg aspirin which i have been taking for approx 19 years.In addition i have some heartburn / reflux which again could be associated with the lisinopril / aspirin so i have been given a 28 day course of Lansaprazole to see if this cures the problem.I feel good about this visit because i made sure i covered everything and hopefully these changes will be for the positive.
