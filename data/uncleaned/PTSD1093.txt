So I have recently been diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress...This stemming from being sexually abused as a young child.I'm not handling this well at all and I never have handled stress well at all... I find myself lashing out at those around me. My condition is seriously affecting my relationship with my boyfriend of a year and he is also having a hard time cooping with this as much as I am. How do I avoid blaming others for what I'm feeling and how can my boyfriend help me help myself?
