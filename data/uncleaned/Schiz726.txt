ÊDoc prescribed both Lithium & Lamictal. Why both?Why did my doctor prescribe both Lithium (900mg) and Lamictal (which will gradually increase) together? They both treat the same thing so I wonder why the need for both?I think he means to keep me on Lamictal long term but I think he is mistaken. I think Lexapro(SSRI) just sent me spiraling into a bipolar manic episode, and once Lexapro is out of my system it should be back to normal.ÊsighI hope this doesn't become permanent damage too, like the wellbutrin gave me permanent brain damage, giving me anxiety and panic attacks for the rest of my life. I feel like the more I get treated the worse things get. When all is said is done, will I live a normal life even? I'm depressed.
