Hit a brick wall¥	Hi all¥	4th treatment done 1st tax felt like crap just hit rock bottom today thinking how far I come already just can't face much more.¥	Fed up of not doing what I want to do going where I want to go and missing work so much never ever thought I would say that just want my life back although I know it won't be the same just different I know I'm not alone got a fantastic family network I feel guilty when I look at my two girlies when I feel like this they try do much to make things better. I think its because it's Easter and we are normally out and about but instead I'm in pain and feeling sorry for myself xx
