Being a petite womanAnyone out there like me and living the small lifestyle. Im currently at the min shopping shoes for my friends wedding where im a bm. i found out last year that im offically a size 2.5 in shoes. Have you ever heard of the like How does anyone find being small? Sometimes i must say i do love it. My husband is really tall at 6'4 so sometimes it can work for us being the opposite height. Im 5ft and find it impossible to find any trousers to fit or shoes. Anyone know of any places to get smaller length trousers/jeans and tiny ass shoes that don't cost the earth???
