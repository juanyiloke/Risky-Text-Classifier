The D files.Seriously.. No wind up. I'm always looking for answers. & I'm not the "spiritual" type by any means..The subject is about the "paranormal" experience & a link with diabetes..? I can easily recount what I have seen/experienced since I was a kid.. Again in my teens.. 20s late 30s then it stopped.. Now recently in a recording studio in Swindon.. All BSs on the whole were normal before you ask..More really to do with the tricks the mind plays chemically... I suppose??There are possible links with diabetes & depression/Schizophrenia/Dementia/Alzheimer's...My dad was T2. Was a straight up bloke. But even he told me of a visit from his dead mother on one occasion. Then went on to develop vascular dementia...I'm thinking the science.. Could diabetics be susceptible to this sort of stuff that "ghost hunters" jump on... But actually be an early warning of something like dementia...?Any thoughts...?
