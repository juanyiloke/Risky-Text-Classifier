Does this happen anyone else?Hi, I'm beginning to think I need help but just want to see if this is normal or not.ÊAbout a week before my period, I become almost unrecognisable. I get so angry and will have arguments for no real reasons. There is absolutely no talking to me. I'm aware of it but not fully if that makes any sense.ÊI can also go the opposite extreme where I cry for no reason at all. I focus on all the negatives in my life, feel hopeless and can't concentrate at all. It's like my brain shuts down.This is so different from the person I usually am. I've lost relationships over this. I have a lot of female medical issues so wonder if it's connected.ÊI cannot continue like this. I'm not looking for medical diagnosis but wondering if this is extreme. People have suggested it's not and I'm concerned if I'm honest.Can anyone relate to this?
