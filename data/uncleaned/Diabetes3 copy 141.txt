Update and good news.My new sensor for the freestyle libre arrived today. And it works perfectly I think the old one was actually faulty. Day five of being hypo free. It does feel pretty good. And my sugars seem to be stablising in that they are averaging around the 8 mark now. They are pretty stable too, so that's good. And since stopping the corrections I haven't needed to do any corrections. As in my sugars haven't gone about 13. Before I was yoyoing. And I admit, I was concerned I'd go into the 20s because I often do. I'm aiming for an entire week hypo free. I can't remember the last time I was hypo free for a week other than when I didn't bother to look after myself after my brother died and was constantly high (and by high then i mean off the scale of the home tester). It's nice to be able to be at college and not have to eat in class, or be out with friends and not have to pop into the shop for some lucozade. And what will boots think of me not buying glucose tablets any more  Thanks for being patient with me. I've decided that from now on I'm not going to let other people (nurses I know who aren't diabetic specialists and have no clue) know anything about my diabetes. There's one that goes to my church and she had a massive go once because my test said I was 11 or something. People like that aren't helpful.
