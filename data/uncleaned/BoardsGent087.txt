Hairstyles for a Balding Man (with pics!)Sadly I'm very rapidly becoming bald. (I'm only 22) As you can see from the pic it is quite pronounced, the hair is still thick enough at the sides and back, eventually I'll end up with Patrick Stewart style hair, with just some on the sides and back and none on top. I'm fine with that so I'm not interested in treatment or surgery or whatever. Basically I want to manage the "balding" stage and do so gracefully. I've thought about just shaving it all off (complete slaphead) but I don't think that would be a very professional look?ÊWhat I have been doing is getting it cut short as it is in the pic. I'm not looking to hide the fact I'm going bald but I want a haircut that doesn't shout at people "this guy is going bald" if that makes sense... you see some people and the first thing you notice is that they are going bald, then you see others and while they may have even less hair its not the first thing you notice, your attention isnt drawn to it.ÊWould a short buzz cut help? Or am I grand as is? Any ideas or suggestions would be welcome. Maybe I'm thinking about this too much.Ê
