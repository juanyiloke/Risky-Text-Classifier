I don't know what to think about thisI feel like I'm going to be judged so hardcore for this... :SSo I posted a thread I think about a week ago discussing my restrictive eating habits. I was eating way less a day than I was supposed to and this morning was going the same way until I finally caved and ate a bunch of junk food. I realized that restricting wasn't making me feel better, it was actually making me way worse, so I ate all the stuff I was craving to feel better. Now I don't know how I feel about it... I don't know what to think. Is this normal at all? Can I just go back to eating normally and "forget" about this and move on or is this something to be concerned about? I am honestly so lost here...
