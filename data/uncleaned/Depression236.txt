Êhi new here Êvivsawyer121,Ê1 Week AgoHi I am new here and a little unsure of myself. I have had depression and anxiety for over 20 years now and recently asked for help professionally went to the mental health team and was told that the past was irrelevant and that my medication was irrelevant( this word was used a lot) I walked out in the end due to feeling totally useless and a fraud a letter has now been sent to me saying I am not suffering with either depression or anxiety and that I am hostile and they won't help. Feeling really ill now and don't know what to do or where to turn.
