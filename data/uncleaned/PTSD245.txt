In search of solid diagnosis.by LabelMeFable » Fri Sep 26, 2014 11:07 pmHello, my name is *mod edit*. This is a new thing for me, so excuse my writing as it may be sporadic. I am search of a diagnosis to several symptoms that I am experiencing. I am worried about this because it is affecting my relationship, and my friendships. Recently my significant other told me I was very distant; emotionally, physically, and intimately. I do have memories of some sexual abuse as a child, though trying to remember anything further becomes clouded. When in regards to my distance to others, I feel objectively different from others. My brain activity as it seems, is very limited and what I mean by that is I have minimal cognitive thought, mostly a blank canvas if you will. I am emotionally distant from others, I do not necessarily lack empathy because I feel sadness, anger, and happiness when directed towards specific situations. However I do not always express it and I am unaware of my emotional state at periods of the day. When cuddling or being physically touched by others, I feel uneasy and if the gesture extends for too long of a time span I begin having a slight panic attack until I remove myself from the situation. I am very reserved; introvert, and secluded in my own thoughts. I rarely speak and when I do it is soft-spoken and I am really unsure of what to say to other people. I feel a tension in most interactions. I try to be happy, and be the friend and boyfriend they need. However they always say there seems to be something wrong. At times, I don't even believe myself, and I have a range of multiple emotions running through me simultaneously. This cannot be normal can it? I am curious as to what exactly could I be suffering from, though this seems in my range of intelligence I am unable to self-diagnose myself without the thought of being a hypochondriac.
