Council houses right to buy.Why does Maggie Thatcher get the credit for giving people the right to buy their council house. Council house tenants were given the right to buy in 1968.my parents among them.(they declined).  At the time you paid the full market value of the property. All Thatcher did in the 1980's was sell them off  cheap.
