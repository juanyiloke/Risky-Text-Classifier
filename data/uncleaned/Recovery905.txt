I had a good day today :)HelloSome of you may have seen my other threads. For the past couple weeks or so I have been trying to cope with my feelings for this girl who goes out with my friend. I've been friends with her for a while but recently I have actually fallen in love with her, and because of this I haven't talked to her in a while.Yesterday, I was lower than ever. I was depressed, my social anxiety seemed worse than before, and I was seriously considering suicide (thank god my plan failed). So today, I woke up and remembered I had scheduled my suicide for today. So I went to school, and do you know what I thought? Fuck this. Sorry about the language, but that is exactly what I thought. I thought, I'm not taking the cowards way out. I'm gonna overcome this social anxiety of mine, and actually talk to her. So at break time, I go up to her and start talking, my heart was beating like hell but I managed to spark conversation, and made her laugh a couple times. Throughout the day I was talking to her a lot and I even arranged to get her number on Monday! So I'm in a good mood today, and for once I'm not thinking about suicide. It just makes you think that you can get through things, not matter how hopeless you feel, and make changes to be happy. Of course, I'd love it if she'd go out with me, but I'm happy that she's in a good relationship and getting closer to her as a friend is good enough for me
