Mental guiltHi there! So long story short, after recovering my body from being anorexic, then relasping back to being a tad too thin, and now having thoughts to puke after eating something "bad" and obsessing over everything I eat or am going to eat during the day. I am working towards recovery again. How do you get past all the negative thoughts and mental guilt of ED? What do I do to be able to eat something and not hate myself afterwards or eat what I want and feel good about it? I want to be able to eat "normally" again and enjoy myself. Just looking for some insight on how others deal or have dealt with these types of thoughts and feelings.Thank you:)
