Reaching For SomethingI came off my medicines cold turkey last year in November. I know- mistake. I felt fine until over a month ago. Now it seems that I keep falling deeper and deeper into the dark hole we all dread. My question is, how does one find motivation when they're already so far under, that they lost almost all hope? How do I handle the situation when I'm feeling depressed? I cry and the bad thoughts don't help. Is there a way to make the voices stop? I don't feel very well and all I'm asking is for some advice. I have major depression disorder with psychosis. I hadn't seen my psychiatrist since last year in November. He wasn't the best. I don't want to rely on meds the rest of my life. Which is why I chose to stop taking them. All advice is welcomed and appreciated. Thank you. R~
