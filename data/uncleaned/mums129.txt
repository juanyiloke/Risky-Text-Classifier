Hi all,This may seem trivial compared to some parenting worries you have but here goes...I don't know if anyone else has seen it but on nick Jr there are a few theme songs that are sung and danced to by 5 adults, 1 of which is a woman in high heels and a red dress that doesn't cover her bum, no tights just naked legs and is all over herself - pretty sure if she could make love to herself, she would. This is not the image I want my daughter seeing. I wouldn't want my daughter dressing like that when she 25 and out on the town let alone seeing it on a children's channel when she's 3. Don't understand why children need to see that at all.FyI: I'm 25 and size 8/10 before you say I'm probably old and fat lol Anyone else seen this? Xxx
