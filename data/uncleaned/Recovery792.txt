My check inHello everyone, I am new here and looking for a little daily support to help me to recover and stay well. I have recently been discharged from my second hospital admission in 3 months for depression that led to a suicide attempt. I have spent more time in hospital than out in recent months and now that I am out in the real world I find I'm missing my daily check-in and group support.So this is my check in for this morning.I feel a bit teary but with the sort of tears that won't come. I feel tired and sleepy and a little drained. I had a psycho therapy session yesterday and I was surprised at how drained it left me. It wasn't too heavy duty but I felt extremely emotional at times over past incidents that I haven't cried over for a while. Today I have a headache and finding it hard to get started. Despite all of that I feel safe. I don't like how I feel today but I will cope without resorting to self destructive activities. I will try to remain present and take very small steps in my recovery. Thanks for listening and any words of support are most welcome.R
