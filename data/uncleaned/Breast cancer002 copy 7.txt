Chemo or not?Hi,I would like others thoughts on my situation please as I'm in a dilemma!Following my mastectomy and immediate ld flap reconstruction on 1st May all my results are now in and thankfully are better than predicted so I know I'm lucky. Having seen the size of my tumour on ultrasound (in fact there were two) I was told I would need chemo and radiotherapy. I was sent for sentinal lymph node biopsy, ct and and bone scans due to the size of the large tumour (expected to be more than 6cm) and was fearing the worst.I am so relieved and surprised (and my team are too) that the tumours turned out to be 8mm and 4.5cm with no lymph node involvement and all scans clear!  I think this is unusual as although not as big as first expected the biggest tumour is still large.I was offered the oncotype DX test where the tissue is tested and a low, medium or high risk chance of the cancer reoccurring is predicted and I'm pleased that this has come back as low risk.Following my appointment with my oncologist last week she now says I don't need to have chemo, possibly not radiotherapy either due to the low risk result and just need to go on tamoxifen for 10 years but I can have the full treatment if I want it. I don't want to have to make the decision! I have said I want everything as "low risk" is not "no risk". Am I doing the right thing putting myself through 4 rounds of chemo if I don't really have to?Sorry for the long story but I need help ...what a decision to have to make!Love to everyone on this difficult journey xx
