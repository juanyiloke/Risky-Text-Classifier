What books on diabetes would you recommend?I was looking at our website earlier and I noted a link to a discussion on the old forum where people were recommending books on diabetes.  Unfortunately the old forum has gone and the link now links to the home page of this forum.  So I am resurrecting the thread here so we can re-direct the link.What books have you found particularly helpful?As a T1 this is my personal list:Think like a Pancreas - by Gary Scheiner.  Well written and easy to understand without too much "medicalese"Using Insulin - by John Walsh - little bit more "medicalese" but still quite understandable.Pumping Insulin - by John Walsh - a must for those on a pump
