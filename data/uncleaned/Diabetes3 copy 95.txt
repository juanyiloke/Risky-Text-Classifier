hiHello, I am a new user to this message board. Ive been diabetic since 1997. Just been to see my doctor and my hba1c has gone high again And im over weight. I try really hard, my blood sugar yoyos all the time, I dont eat much because I dong feel hungry and I got for walks twice a day. I have depression too and feel really down, my diabetic team are completely rubbish and keep rearranging my appointment to see the specialist. I feel stuck and completely forgotten about.   I dont know what to do anymore, just feels like whatever I try to do, I fail
