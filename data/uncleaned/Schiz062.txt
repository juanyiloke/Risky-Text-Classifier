I finally developed full blown paranoid schizophreniaby Supersaneman » Mon Mar 02, 2015 3:25 pmIt's been a long time since I last used this site. I've got these voices in my head arguin with each other etc, not real sound, but clear as sound. And worse I have problems eating etc because the voices actually interfere with my body making me suddenly feel like barfing when eating. I'm on my laptop so I'll keep this brief.Getting diagnosed got me lots of money and care; I have a much better life now. I think however I am able to, or was able to hear subliminals coming from almost everywhere. I keep thinking they are real and my meds ruin my ability to hear them clearly.I've been imagining myself as a prophet first, then later a god, before wiping out all other gods. And I'm an atheist. Maybe there's some other reason than schizophrenia for the voices like my stroke for instance.
