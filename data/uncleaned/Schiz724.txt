ÊWhat do you hallucinate?I'm very curious to hear of what others hallucinate.ÊPersonally, I see animals and hear voices. But they seem very real to me. For example, there are two birds/parrots in my room named Blue and Red who live above my bed in a nest. I have nothing wrong with that, except for the fact Blue is dangerous. He attacks me and tells me to hurt people and says he will peck my eyes out if I don't. I'm not allowed to go to sleep until a certain time because of him, and i'm feeling anxious writing this because I feel him watching me. Red can't speak, and she is pregnant (yay!). I am scared of going into my room a lot, because I can always sense when something is there.ÊAlso, I see Rats. They seem to follow me everywhere and are really mischevious. I wish others could hear/see them too sometimes. I would love to hear your experiences
