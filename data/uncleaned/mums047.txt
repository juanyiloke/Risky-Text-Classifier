Anyone else feel or felt like this? Hoping someone can tell me it gets better.ÊI have a lovely 9 week old DS and a 2.1 year old DS. Before DS2 came along, DS1 was my World, my little side kick and we happily ambled along together. However DS2 arrived in January and much as I love him too, its been hard. I am ebf and DS2 feeds A LOT and will not be put down without screaming his head off. I think the screaming and attention is starting to get on DS1s nerves and make him jealous as he has started to hit DS2 which is heartbreaking for me to see for both of them.ÊI get out to as many groups as I can with DS1 or to the park etc as this allows me to give DS1 some attention because DS2 seems more settled when we're out and about. However it's the "getting out the house" bit that's hard. Between DS2's feeding and need for holding, it takes me all morning just to get us all fed and dressed and keep contain the mess. Sometimes I dont make the groups on time or if I do I feel like ive been such a stressy shouty mum (DS1 will either have tantrumded,destroyed something or continually hit DS2) that I wonder if theres any point in me having this one hour of fun with him since the rest of the days been no fun for him. I have a sling which helps a lot, but it doesnt help when im trying to get us all cleaned and dressed one time.I cant even manage bedtime because DS2 cluster feeds from 6pm so I am stuck on the couch feeding. I feel like I have completely abandoned DS1 and it breaks my heart to think how he is feeling. I am so full of guilt and miss my little boy.ÊPeople offer to help by taking DS1 for a few hours but this just makes it worse because I dont want him taken away. A friend has just phoned and insisted on taking him out and Im just sat here feeding DS2 feeling so sad.
