Consequences to reference over injury claim________________________________________Hi everyone.First of all apologies if this is not exactly the correct section.. I hope it is.Basically I have found myself in the awkward situation where I feel I have no other choice but to lodge a personal injuries claim against my employers insurance company... Not a nice ideal situation I know, I am a long time employee with over 20 years of service.I plan to continue working here for the near future, although I'm not sure what the atmosphere will be like after the claim is lodged lol.But Unfortunently the injury I suffered has cost me personally a lot of money and could eventually mean I am no longer suited to my role and I may be let go or have to look for a new Job that i can physically do.What I am wondering is, with regards of making a claim and then possibly down the road if ever looking for a reference from the employer are you in trouble? Trust me when I say this is far from the route I wanted to take, but all attempts I have made to deal with the matter in house have been futile..Any help or advice would be appreciated
