PositivesI know, I'm weird. Everyone who knows me says that I am. But I was thinking the other day about how life-changing a cancer diagnosis and treatment is, and I realised that for me some of these changes have been for the better. I think the situation encourages clarity of thought and vision, and for that I'm grateful. I've spent a load of time with the kids (7 and 4) and got to know them really well. But the biggest change has been letting go of the idea of control. I've always known that we really aren't in control of our lives as much as we like to think we are, but this has brought this home with a visceral reality. And once I accepted the idea that there is nothing I can do about this situation other than hand the responsibility for recovery over to my team, it was as though a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders. For almost 100% of the time, I feel calm. Ok, I have my moments but nowhere near as much as I would have thought I would have done, pre-cancer. How can this be?
