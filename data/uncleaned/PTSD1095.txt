I was diagnosed with PTSD in November 2009 after having symptoms for three years that due to a major trigger suddenly became much worse. Since then I have chronic anxiety & panic attacks & have been prescribed antidepressants which I am very reluctant to take due to a mis-trust in medication and a feeling that I've got to get through this by other means if my recovery is to be sustained. With the help of my psychologist I think I've beaten the panic attacks with deep breathing, water therapy (I recently bought a Hot-tub, its the best £300 I've ever spent! & meditation. Has anyone else been in this position? I'm starting to feel that I'm being awkward by not taking the meds.
