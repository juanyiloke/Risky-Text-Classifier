Ive been this way for many years and some things are better but the bad ones are still here, i have a real bad anger problem im quick to get mad and agressive, i always feel that i need to protect myself that something or someone will attack me. I spent alot of years as a Marine sniper, my job wasnt the best in the world but i had to do it.(VERY BAD WORK) i suffer every day and people, even the ones close to me just dont understand why i cant let it go! I cant.....its part of me, its always in my head and my dreams...when i do sleep. My doctors have had me on about 12 different anti deps, none has really helped or did anything for my temper. or my sleep, i average about 10 or 13 hours sleep in a 5 day period!! im getting to old for this but NO-ONE has been able to fix me....
