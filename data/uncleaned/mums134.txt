I go back to work tomorrow (only for 2 days a week), DS is 11mo. I'm sitting here right now, in the middle of the day whilst he has a big long feed (bf) and thinking "what the hell am I doing, this is going to be a disaster"!!We have no schedule. I've put no work whatsoever into getting him napping well or getting him off the boob. He sleeps "on the hoof" - either in the car or buggy depending on what I'm doing with his older sister. If we're out and about and he's distracted, he might not feed all day, but if we're home and he fancies it he will. Don't think he's ever gone a whole day with no bf though (does drink water/milk well from a cup, but not a whole feed's worth)This entirely unstructured routine suits us fine. But is it going to be a nightmare for my mum who's going to be looking after them?Have I created a disaster?!
