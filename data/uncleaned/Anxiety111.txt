Spiralling Ê10    I'm sure I'm having a mental breakdown- I have panic attacks all the time and havnt slept in  . I've been pushing on trying to go to work but I can't concerntrate on a thing and I'm falling massively behind. I just can't sit still. It's spiralling out of control. Ive been prescribed anti anxiety drugs by the doctor but they take weeks to start working. I don't know what to do in the meantime. My worries are health related - a very stupid mistake iv made recently which has affected my health. I can't get these things out of my head and I feel like I'm falling apart. How do I get out of this spiral?
