ÊEverything is falling apart!I have been getting Cognitive Analytic Therapy for my eating disorder and today was session 15 out of 20 sessions but it went horribly, horribly wrong and now I can't go back. In today's session, the first one back after the Christmas break, I just tried to express my anxiety about how I don't feel I will have made enough progress by the end of the sessions but the therapist didn't really reassure me on that so I got very depressed.ÊThen I said I wasn't sure if I should bother with the last 5 sessions and she got defensive, snapping at me that it's my choice. I realise now I went about it the wrong way but I was only trying to get some reassurance that it is worth going to the last sessions. I didn't mean to be disrespectful or ungrateful or anything.I ended up having a full-on breakdown, made a massive fool of myself, and saw my therapist for the cold-hearted, inept therapist she is. I never want to see her again but I don't know what will happen now. I still have an eating disorder and don't feel like I have made any progress towards overcoming it or even managing it. I don't want to abandon treatment but feel like I have no choice.I don't get CAT. All I've done for 15 sessions is talk about the stress in my life. The therapist thinks she has helped me to see that I use my eating disorder as a coping mechanism for when things feel out of control, but I knew that before I even started therapy. Knowing that doesn't help me change things.I thought therapy would help me to address my body image issues and help me work to change my attitude to food and weight. I thought I would be given strategies to cope with changing my eating habits and gaining weight. It hasn't been like that at all. We've barely even talked about eating, food and weight etc. I'm so confused.I seriously don't know what to do. I have badly messed up and I think I have ruined my chance to get treatment. I can't afford private therapy.
