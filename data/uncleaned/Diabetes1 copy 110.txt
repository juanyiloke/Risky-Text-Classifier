Help needed new to thisHi I recently had a routine blood test which when I got my results I was told my blood sugar levels were a wee bit high so I go into see the nurse today she tells my that everything like my cholesterol and so on are all fine she said the test that measures your blood sugar level over a few months was a little high she definitely told me it was 4.3 and anything between 4.2 and 4.8 was classed as impaired /pre diabetes to watch my diet and so on but when I research it that number seems normal she also said that only last year the guidelines were changed on this can any one help me sorry for the big message but I have no idea who's right and so on thanks in advance
