I'm scared that i have something really bad like cancer :(  6    i have been having a problem with my ear for the past 5 months i keep getting a ear ach on and off each week some  its bad some  i can deal with it i have seen 4 different doctors and they say my ear is all clear and there is nothing there. i can feel a lump at the back of my ear right under just near my bottom jaw bone i dont know if its my anxiety that is making me feel like its somthing bigger than it is or if it is and am not being paranoid im just sick of having to worry and pretend am ok and thats its not affecting me when deep down thats all i keep thinking about. has anyone els had somthing the same or am i just being silly and making it bigger than it really is am just really sceard about it now
