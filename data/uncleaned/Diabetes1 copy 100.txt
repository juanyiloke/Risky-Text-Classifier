Latest review and Hba1c results.Great news today I would love to share and hopefully inspire.My annual review results seems was a total vindication in my taking onboard a LCHF lifestyle change.Hba1c this time last year was 67 .....now 51 Cholesterol was 4.7 ....now 4.6 My Db nurse couldn't access my trigs ldl's but I will get a full print out next week.My weight has gone down from 18st -6 ....to 16st -6lbsShe asked how I did it, I told her about the diet, the low carb regime, the self testing of foods and basing my diet on the lowest carb options, this forum, the levels of help, support and friendship I received, how I was warmly welcomed and no longer felt alone.For all of above I thank you guys, you know who you are, but too many to mention.Good luck peeps, keep those carbs under control and keep up those exercises.  Best wishes to allTeddy
