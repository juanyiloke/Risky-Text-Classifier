More than just asthma?________________________________________For about 1.5-2 months now, I have had a back pain just to the right of my left shoulder blade. It hurts when I breathe in deeply, sneeze, etc. Its been this way for the entire time I've had it but then last Wednesday I had pains that felt like a heart attack. I'm only 26 so i know i wasn't having one but I had the pain in my back at that exact spot that then shot through to just under my left breast and came in waves. Every time i walked around or moved, it took my breath away and i had to take shallow breaths to get any air in. about 12 hrs later it went away. (I almost went to the ER but with 4 kids and a husband at work, I had no choice but to wait it out) Less than a week later, I decided to go to urgent care where she suspected ti was lung related. Gave me a breathing test where you blow in a tube to get the desired number. She wanted me to shoot for 425 and up. I tried 3 times in a row and got 225, 250, 285 during the tries. After that I was having coughing fits and couldn't breathe. They gave me a neb treatment and did a chest xray. They showed no signs of pneumonia but she still suspected lung related problems. She sent me home with a daily steroid inhaler (to help prevent the problem), muscle relaxers, and motrin 500 mg on top of my asthma meds I am already taking. Yesterday I spent 99 percent of the day coughing a chesty cough and have had no cold in the past few months that I can remember, just terrible allergies. I feel as though the breathing issues have worsened and the meds aren't helping the pain in my back. its like someone is stabbing or pushing really hard with their foot when I take a deep breath in in my upper back next to my left shoulder blade. Occasionally I will get that pain I had before but it doesn't last as long. I'm trying to figure out what it is or could be. My pcp is booked up until next month and I keep begging for a sooner appt but they say he has no cancellations so they cant' help :/ I also can't breathe if I lay on my back at all and yesterday evening felt crackly sounds in my lower rib cage but they went away by morning. (odd!) any idea what it could be?!
