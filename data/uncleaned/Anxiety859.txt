Abuse related anxiety and returning to workMy psychiatrist this morning said that although i have dreadful memories from past abused, the best thing to do is to get back to work as soon as possible. It is a way of distracting. They have talked about PTSD, which i have some features of, and how the best way to deal with that is to get back to work as soon as possible.ÊI lay in bed this morning with my memories. They tied me to the bed for about an hour. I cringed at other thoughts, a physcial cringe. Regarding abused, i'm also talking about time spent depressed and all the pain associated with that. I've had some dreadful experiences in hospital that left me wracked with anxiety. The psychiatrist knows all of this. Validates all of this. Says to get back to work and try to move on. That is the best cure. Distraction not dwelling. This seems to me like climbing Mount Everest.What do you think? Have you done the same? Did it help?Love ParissaGADI worry about most things most of the time. I worry about everything. I can feel positive, and be positive, but i fear everything. I fear doing things wrong, saying the wrong thing, upsetting others, people talking about me. I think it comes from a supreme lack of confidence, although i have some confidence, underneath i'm a nervous wreck. The psychiatrist thinks it is related to depression, and i have just been discharged following a major depressive episode, but i think it is always with me, depressed or not. It is just worse when depressed. Much worse. I get irrational and panicky about everything. I'm hoping to sort my thoughts out on here and speak with those who are feeling the same and have the same troubles.ÊI'm due to return to work in the new year, but occupational health are going to get in touch in the new year and we will discuss how i am then. I've been off for about 6 months, and the longer i am off the harder i think it is to go back, but i know i have to eventually.
