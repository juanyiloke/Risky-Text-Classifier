Blood Pressure DilemmaEvery time I go the nurse to get my BP checked it is sky high mainly because I cannot relax plus the fact I always seem to be sitting in traffic and worrying about getting there on time.I had an appointment about 2 weeks ago where it was high and have to go back this Friday at the exact same time and the exact same problems getting there.I have an OMRON M2 BASIC monitor at home and have been keeping a record since the last appointment.Doing this twice daily and the readings are absolutely normal for my age(58) eg 145/75,147/77,etc.Not one over 150 on the upper scale and not one over 80 on the lower scale.I even had one of 131/65 one day.But the nurse doesn't seem to believe me.Keeps asking if the batteries are low.So do I go next Friday or say to hell with it,i know my BP is fine and cancel.There is nothing to be gained by going as I will be as anxious as hell and getting a high reading.What do you guys think.
