  UPDATE: Lung nodule found on CT. Day before my 30 birthday.Im 30 years old nosmoker healthy person. I had terrible infection/inflammation 12 weeks ago. But the cough and tickle in my throat and chest wont go away. Two days ago i had CT with contrast and they found 1,6cm nodule on lower side of my right lung. And something that looks like a Thymus that doesnt shrinked in my puberty in size around 3cm. My home doc and my pulmologist keeps telling me that this isnt a cancer. How can they be so sure ?. Im freaking out. I have pains since beggining originating from location of this 1,6 nodule. I can post my CT photos of it. And maybe translate the piece of paper with described result, cause its in German.
