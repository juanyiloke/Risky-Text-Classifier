AttitudesI found a work colleagues attitude unbelievable today. It made me cry so much. I work in a school and a meeting came up and I would have liked to have gone. I found out last minute as I was preparing my lunch . I was told quite bluntly I did not have to go. It made me feel more even less part of the school . As nobody had even told me and if I had I could have delayed my lunch and eaten something smaller earlier- I am on medication and I need to eat regular . People don't realise how much diabetes and medication had an affect on day to day and cannot just drop things.
