VaginismusHi LadiesI am not sure if this is the right place to post this but anyway....Firstly, I am wondering if any of you ladies suffer from the above condition and were successful in treating it?Secondly I have not yet been diagnosed (and I am not seeking medical advice), but I am pretty sure I suffer from the above as I am unable to have intercourse due to the extreme pain. I am looking for any advise as to who would be the best person to go to for a diagnosis, GP? Well woman clinic? private clinic? I am nervous to go and have been avoiding this for years (I am 25).ÊI guess I have a defeatist attitude and have already resigned myself to a life of celibacy. Any positive advice would be appreciated.Thanks
