Hi everyone!ÊI have a 3 and a half week old baby. She has always been demanding on feeds, I'd say wanting to go no more than an hour between them. I had to give up bf for a few days while I went into hospital for an operation ( couldn't feed her expressed because of the drugs I had to take ) so she went on to formula. So I expressed and threw the milk away and she went onto formula. As soon as I was back out and doctors gave me the all clear I started bf again. I was expressing 28oz in 24 hrs in hospital. Since starting again she has been wanting boob lots at first I thought this was to bring up my supply but now I'm not sure. It's been 5 days and she is still wanting to cluster feed. It starts around 10:30 in the morning and goes on till 7 at night. She comes off boob, cries goes back on and the cycle continues. Barley anything else will console her just boob. Today has been a bad day! She was up every hour in the night and has barley slept since 10:30 this morning. She infact caught one 20 minute nap, and I had to soothe her through that.ÊAs we speak she is still fighting sleep.. I'm In the dark, phone light on low and baby white noise cd on hoping..ÊDo you think she is over tired or does require all the feeding? She doesn't seem to gulp much when she is latched after the first ten minutes. She's pooing lots today I've had 5 dirty nappies plus wet ones.ÊShe seems overly fussy and at times cries on boob and scratches at me like she's frustrated.ÊThe feeding is getting me down and I'm worried that I'm not reading her signs right or soothing her well enough... This is my first baby.Thanks for replies in advance !
