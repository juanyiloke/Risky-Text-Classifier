Eye surgeryDoes anyone know if T1s are able to have sight correcting laser eye surgery? I am trying to get an idea about it before I go to an opticians to ask about it as I like to go into things a bit prepped so I'm not fobbed off or persuaded to have an unwise treatment.About 30 years ago I had laser treatment for retinopathy which worked well and I've had no further problems. I've had cataract surgery on both eyes. As I'm writing this I think I can almost answer my own question and probably shouldn't explore this but wonder if anyone has any knowledge about this.I fed up with all the different glasses I need and cannot get on with variofocals at all.
