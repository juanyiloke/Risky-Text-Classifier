Coming off Venlafaxine XL HiI've been on this drug for 10 years at 75mg, more recently 150mg.I've always known that coming off these is a nightmare, as even if I was late with a dose I would feel unwell, zaps in the head, tired, sick, you name it!I've decided I want to come off altogether (for a variety of reasons) and I thought I'd share my progress as I go along.Despite my GP suggesting that I just drop from 150 to 75mg in one hit, I have decided to do it really slowly and cautiously to avoid withdrawal symptoms. I went from 150 - 130mg (1 x 75, 1 x 37.5 and half a 37.5) to get to around the 130 mg mark. This was 6 days ago.Even with this slight decrease I have noticed the withdrawal.I'm determined to stick with it, and stabilise, until these symptoms wear off - then I'll be reducing down to 112 mg.It'd be great to hear of your attempts/success stories and/or your experience on this drug.Thanks for reading x
