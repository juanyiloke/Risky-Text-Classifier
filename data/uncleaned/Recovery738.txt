Knocking down the brick wallI am after some advice. I have built a brick wall around myself in regards to my anxiety an depression. I realise I need help and am seeing a psychologist as well as being on medication. I have only just started to see the psychologist and I am scared that he won't want to help me if I keep the brick wall up. I was abused as a child (sexually and verbally) and built the wall to protect myself. How can I take the wall down so that the real me will shine and I can get my self esteem back? Thanks.
