ÊED Thoughts Tumbling Around Inside My HeadHow many calories are enough? How many calories are too much? How low can I go without slowing down my metabolism? How many pounds can I lose in a week? How many pounds can I lose before my therapist comes back from holidays? How much exercise is enough? How much can I do? And today is cloudy, gloomy, and cold, and I don't even want to step outside. I am feeling really low, don't want to do anything, eat anything, but I have 3 days until my weigh day, and I need to exercise and get off my big fat ass if I want to lose enough weight.
