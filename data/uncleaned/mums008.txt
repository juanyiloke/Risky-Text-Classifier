I'd love to get your advice on this. My 7 year old daughter has recently started helping herself to food from the cupboard, eating it in secret, and hiding the wrappers. The first time I found a load of sweet wrappers stuffed under her bedside table when I was hoovering her bedroom. So they were hidden, but not that well. I tried not to make a big deal of it, explained it's not healthy to eat lots of sweets in one go and also not fair on her brother as the sweets were to be shared and left it at that.She tends to get up before everyone else (early riser) and is allowed to help herself to fruit. A couple of times over the last couple of weeks, she has taken cereal bars or fruit winder type things. I have explained these are for treats/after school snacks and if she wants to eat first thing she can have fruit. I've just been to hoover her bedroom again and found a box of cereal bars and two wrappers.ÊTo give you more context: I tried to feed the children a healthy diet but I'm really not controlling about food. Compared to some of my mum friends I think I am positively relaxed! But still, I don't want them eating endless sweet treats and junky snacks. My daughter has a good packed lunch (more than her 9 year old brother) and it always comes home empty. She always has an after school snack or two. The fruit bowl is always open. She has a home-cooked meal each evening (and rarely eats it all, I don't think her portion sizes are too small).I really want to nip this in the bud. I don't want to get it wrong and cause her problems with eating or humiliate her, but I am concerned about the effect on her weight if it carries on and her teeth. Help- how would you approach this?
