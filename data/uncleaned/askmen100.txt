Advice on turning down work?2012-09-19, 12:58 AMI've had a new job for almost three months. I feel like I'm keeping up but not necessarily doing well. So I am adequate but by far not the best. My supervisor recently decided to give me a project that involves doing reports for our VP. So obviously this would be a step up in responsibility.ÊI've never done this before but I almost feel tempted to turn down this new responsibility. How negative will that look upon my in the future? Is there a nice way to turn down something because you're mature enough to recognize that it's not for you or will you alway look bad for doing so?
