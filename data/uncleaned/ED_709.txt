Afraid of a relapseI have had an eating disorder in the past (not quite so distant) and after recovery became pregnant. I'm 38 weeks along now and the only thing that has kept the food-related anxiety at bay is reminding myself that I'm feeding the baby. I have been able to disconnect myself from the process of eating with this pattern of thought.Now, due date rapidly approaching, it has hit me exactly how much weight I've gained. The fact that the baby and various "accessories" doesn't account for it all makes me extremely nervous. I'm so afraid that after she's born I'm going to completely fall apart.ÊI've communicated this to my fiance and he said that he's going to watch for any troubling signs and make sure that I have help straight away...I'm not sure what I'm getting at here but I'm just...terrified. I don't know how I'm going to cope with the extra weight and still eat normally.
