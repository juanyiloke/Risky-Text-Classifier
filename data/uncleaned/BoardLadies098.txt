ÊWhat's the most insulting present you ever got?Right, it was my birthday yesterday - I am now 39. A lot of miles on the clock I know, but I look and feel a lot younger. Sure, last weekend I was at a nightclub dancing till 4am! I'm fitter and slimmer than I was at 20.Anyway I was pleased to have people telling me yesterday that I look nowhere near 39 - that was enough of a birthday present for me!Until I arrived home from work today to find a card and a present from my mother-in-law. The present? Olay anti-wrinkle provital tinted moisturiser for mature skin!!!!!! FFS, this stuff is for over-70s!! I'm tempted to ask her did she leave her new moisturiser behind by accident. But I'll just have a rant on Boards instead!ÊSo what's the worst birthday present you ever got?
