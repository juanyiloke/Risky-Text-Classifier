Extreme relationship anxiety?The boy I've now been dating for almost a year has been my best friend for about 4 years. We're really close, and he and my other two best friends (one male and one female, both of whom I've been friends with for approximately 14 years) are also really close. Lately, I've been overthinking constantly about every little thing in our relationship and have been struggling with the idea that he might be or get closer to my female friend than he is with me. She's always been sort of cuddly with him, but I know that she doesn't mean it in a harmful way - she's sort of a sister-almost-mother figure to all of us. However, yesterday I stormed out on my friends (trying to NOT freak out, but failing) because of some of the cuddly-ness. However, I don't want them to become less close. Normally the closeness between the four of us doesn't bother me but lately it has and this started up seemingly for no reason. I miss our Friends-ish kind of relationship with one another.Also, I think it's important to relate that I've been under tons of stress lately, between my exams, volleyball, college work, etc. Also, my two prior boyfriends (and people I thought were friends) backstabbed me.ÊI think the biggest fear of mine is being replaced, and it's become almost paralyzing and it's to the point where I feel horribly guilty and like nothing I do will have a good outcome.Can anyone help me or has anyone gone through a similar situation?Sorry for such a long post but I needed to vent and to see if anyone understands what I'm going through!
