Help Please! Just Diagnosed T2  4  hi all,i was diagnosed last week with Type 2. On Christmas Eve....nice gift Huh!?My number was 335.Doc put me on 500 mg of Metformin 1x a day and 2mg glimepiride 1x day.i just cut the glimepiride in half to 1mg, Doc okayed it.My numbers have come back into normal range for the past 4 days, I have been on a strict diet that I put myself on, low carb, no sugar, using Stevia.here is my problem that scares me to death: since I stared taking the meds and have eaten right, my vision is very blurry.i have severe anxiety/panic attacks.my doc told me my levels had to get back to normal and that my vision would return to normal too.i had 20/20 before this and now can't read anything on the comp screen and everything else has a blur to it (slight) for distance.this is scaring me to death, I'm doing everything I need to so why isn't itnormal yet.ive read in other forums people say a week, 3 weeks, one guy said 3 months!I understand why, they get blurry but would like to know a timeline, I'm praying it comes back quick.i just had to buy another pair of reading glasses, I went from 1.00 to 1.50.has anyone ever had this? Please tell me how long before your vision returned.Will exercise help to quicken the process of restoring it? Im 45 femalenon hereitary, just horriblefiid choices.I need to lose about 30lbs more.to be in normal weight for myself.Any advice or information would be much appreciated! Thank you so much!
