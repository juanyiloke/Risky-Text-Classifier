Êanger and frustrationI am angry because my family still treats me like a child. They all tell me what I am doing now is wrong and what I should do to be better. My mom has gone so far as to say I am the weakest family member and she doesn't think I can make it on my own. I am not like them. I do not want to be like them. They hurt me and they expect me to suck it up and keep it inside like they do. I did that for too long and that is one reason I am the way I am now.
