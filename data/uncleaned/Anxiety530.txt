Dealing with 'Anxiety Sensitivity'Been dealing with Anxiety for about 10 years now.Ê Been on and off Lexapro (off because I feel so much better I don't think I need it, on again when I relapse, Derp!) and I've had a great psychologist there for me when I couldn't pull myself out of it.Ê I haven't seen her in many years, mainly because she taught me so much and a few self help books really just reteach me what she did for a smaller cost. :)My first episode of anxiety had me laid up on the couch for 2 weeks.Ê Couldn't eat, sleep, function.Ê It was the scariest thing of my entire life.Ê It was triggered by some health issues.Ê All which turned out to be nothing, but at the time felt like my entire world was falling apart.Ê I think I have a bit of PTSD from this experience.ÊAfter seeking help and working out of that I have had a handful of 'episodes' since then, never as bad, but still horrible enough that it effects my daily.Ê Most of the time what happens is a health issues triggers it, but then in a few days I get over that, but then there is something else I can't quite shake.While researching today....research as in self help, it gets me through!Ê I stumbled on 'anxiety sensitivity' and I think this explains exactly what I have.Ê Basically I get anxiety about having anxiety.Ê Once that main fear has passed, now I have to deal with all the fear that I'm here again, dealing with anxiety and will it ever go away and on and on with the negative self talk.Anyone else get this 'left over' fear of anxiety which makes it really hard to get rid of?Ê I can talk myself out of my medical fear with logic.Ê But it's hard to kick that left over anxiety.
