free style libreHi all I've been lucky enough to get a free style libre......am not sure what to say as I have mixed feelings. I started it yesterday and the readings were way out. I had a 3.7 when my blood sugar was 10.......I was about to ring abbott this morning to have a rant however today the readings seem reasonable. At the moment am not too sure whether I trust this enough to use all the time which I believe kind of defeats the point of actually using it. I realise the sensor can take time to bed in which I accept others have had the same issue. What I object to is abbott not really stating this. If I buy a sensor that is to last 14 days I do not really think it is fair to get a whole day of nonsense readings! Anyone else have the same opinions? Don't get me wrong I think it is a great move forward however a little disappointed
