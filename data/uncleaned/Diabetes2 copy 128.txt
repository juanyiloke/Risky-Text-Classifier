Best Foods for Type 2 DiabetesHi Can someone offer an opinion on the best fruits for t2 diabetics in terms of not causing spikes in blood sugar.  Also which bread, my husband eats wholemeal bread which I believe some say causes spikes.  I have read that rye and granary are better although he complains granary gets stuck in his dentures).  My local supermarket bake a wheat, spelt and rye bread which he likes, would this be ok.  Also yogurts he usually has low fat fruit yogurt, have read this is not good either.  Have been looking at recipes on Diabetes UK which seem interesting have saved some to try.  Things seemed to have changed a lot since my son was diagnosed with type 1 as a 2 year old way back in the 1970s.  Then it was all about portion size and making sure you got enough carbohydrate inbetween meal snacks as well.  I am ordered a blood sugar monitor which should arrive this week.  Hopefully it will tell us where he may be going wrong in terms of what to eat.  Before anyone says you can get them from the gp or manufacturer I tried that with no success.  Thanks
