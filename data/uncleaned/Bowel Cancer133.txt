What's counselling like?I had my last operation in January 2011 and everything has been fine ever since, but now I'm wondering if counselling might be helpful for me. I'm a little apprehensive though, so was just wondering what it's like really, and how do you know if you need it? Because sometimes I think it would be a good idea, and sometimes I think it's fine, I don't want to waste anyone's time if I don't need it, and maybe I'm being a bit dramatic since everything has been okay for a year, and I don't really understand why I'm feeling bad about it now. Plus, I work from 8:30 until 5:30 every day, and depending when you can get appointments (I assume it's at the hospital if you go through your GP, and that's the only way to get it for free?), I don't even know if I'd have time if they don't offer appointments at the weekend. Any insight would be very helpful.
