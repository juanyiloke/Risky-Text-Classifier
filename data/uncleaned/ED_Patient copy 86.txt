Tribunal hearingSo I had one today regarding my CTO,and the outcome is I'm staying on it.Im not very happy as one of the condition is for me to be at 50kg weight,but I lost already quite a bit and I'm worry they will recall me to hospital.I decided not to attend for any app and not to answer any phone call so I can do my own things.Im not happy with my weight and they can't force me to gain if I feel huge already.My question is can they came to my house and check on me or they will just leave me alone.I don't want to attend for any more appointment.Life has no sense for me...I'm hardly getting out of bed as my mood is so low so they should understand is hard for me to attend app.I don't know what to to,I suppose to start work,but everything seems to much...
