Coping with Fear of re-occuranceAllI was diagnosed with rectal cancer in Aug 2011 which was originally diagnosed as Stage I (Dukes A). Surgery in Sept 2011 to remove the tumor with a loop ilestomy. Diagnoses was changed in Oct 2011 from Stage I to Stage III (Dukes C) because of lymph node involvement. I had 8 cycles of chemo therapy scheduled but i was only able to complete 4 because of complications DVT and serious blood infection. I had my Reversal in March 2012 and coping relativly well since. I have had a CT Scan at six months with a follow up colonoscopy a couple of months ago along with 3 monthly blood tests with my CEA levels coming down during the last year. I have just had another CT Scan with a follow up appointment on Friday of this week.However this time round I am terrified that my oncologist is going to tell me the cancer has come back and the fear is affecting me badly. I am surprised at how frightned i feel becuase all indication and tests so far show that is highly likely that all the cancer has been removed. Am I right to be fearfull or am i just being a bit of wimp (bit much for a 55 year old ex paratrooper). Even during my initial diagnoses and treatment i was never as worried\frightned as I am now of what might happen on Friday.Help :-[
