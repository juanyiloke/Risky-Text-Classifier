Asthma and sex________________________________________Hi! Ive got low level chronic asthma. I also have allergy to plants, dogs, cats, etc. But my worse trigger is sex. Im not taking anything currently to control ny asthma. The problem is that if i have sex, then i can feel wheezing, and its harder for me to breath the next day when exercising. So, some doctor recommended me to take Salbutamol (ventolin) before having sex or exercise...The problem is that this is not a one-time issue. Im having this problem everytime i have sex. So, wouldnt it be wise to take something to prevent it everyday, like Budesonide (pulmicort)??Thanks!
