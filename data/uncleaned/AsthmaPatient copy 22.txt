i have asthma but never really had a attack  4  hey i suffer from anxiety so everytime i feel i cant breathe i take my asthma inhaler but i dont know if this is asthma attacks or not i woke up and i felt i could not take a full breathe properly i took my inhaler 3 times before bed because i had the same sensation before going to sleep i felt phelm was stuck but i could not get it out as i have not got a powerful cough to get it out .i woke up with a slight wheeze this morning so i took my inhaler twice and it helped get abit of phelm up and the wheeze went away but im left with the feeling of a wheeze without one ?also my throat feels like im been strangled where my adams apple would be if i was a man .i get a thump thump kinda feeling that effects my breathing like something is constricting and letting go down my throat i have also woken with white dry lips which i have never suffered with dry lips until recently and this is when my breathing has not been that good i have not had a asthma check for a long time and last time i went they gave me the brown and blue inhaler but i have only been taking the blue as i ran out of brown years ago .does this sound like ashtma or not ?thankyou
