tummy larger since mastectomy¥	I know it sounds crazy but my stomach seems much larger since my right sided mastectomy four and a half weeks ago.  I am 9st 1lb, which is about what I was before surgery but my stomach is definitely larger and I don't like it! I had a sentinel node biopsy at the time of surgery - is the increase in tummy size anything to do with lymph drainage? I haven't had quite as much exercise for obvious reasons but walk every day and I am trying to eat sensibly.  I find the tummy size more depressing than the loss of the boob!  Am I losing the plot or has anyone else experienced this?
