GAD or HypomaniaSo I've had anxiety and very mild depression for about 20 years. I am 37 nowIt's been more or less stable for the better part of 20 years, but last few years have been very stressful because of some family deaths and other issuesI went back into therapy. For now its just a psychiatrist and she put me on Zoloft. First 25 mg, then 50 mg, and now 100 mg50 mg made me feel great and no major side effects. After going to 100 mg, I stared feeling pretty crappy with a number of side effects (its only been 5 days on 100 mg)I called the doctor and she thinks I might have Hypomania. A very light version of Bi-Polar disorderI am having a hard time understanding it. I've researched this a bit and while the general symptoms of Hypomania don't apply to me, there are some things that I've read and experience that point me in that direction.The problem is that these "symptoms" of possible Hypomania could also be assigned to GAD.I am convinced I have GAD, but she thinks I might also, or instead, be Bi-Polar. I know I don't have Mania, but Hypomania is a lighter version is often harder to diagnose if anyone has experience with this and can either clear this up for me or recommend where I can research this further, I would really appreciate it!
