Êfeel so disconnected from lifeHello. I have felt like I have lost connection in life to things that I loved and just became a different person long ago. I was always the type who enjoyed people's company and still do. Other times, it feels like I am looking for the nearest exist and shouldn't be like that. Ever since my mom said between 12-13 yrs of age that she wished she should've smothered me seemed like something severed in the back of my head.Since then, I wasn't the same at all that's traumatic to hear. I do go out and meet people it doesn't feel the same way before age 10 when it was no worries and have tons of worries now. I just feel so disconnected about life been reading self help books on my own try incorporating what I learned into everyday practice - still feel like I am not connected to life.I have this therapist well let's just say she can't proceed with the therapy with the toxic environment I am in since I don't have enough finances on my own. Next week, she wants me to bring in a timeline about my life so she can see what's been going on not sure what's gonna happen next. She said you need to leave your situation oh really? Who's paying for it? Finding out by having PTSD has really taken a toll on my life makes things difficult. Hmm, I don't want it to overtake my life. Something is still floating over me not sure what it is.I don't know but I do want better for myself. I am just venting if anyone wants to share their thoughts.
