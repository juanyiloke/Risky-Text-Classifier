DESMOND - worth it?So having been diagnosed I was booked onto a DESMOND course pretty quickly but have discovered, both by personal experience of my GP and practice nurse and from reading other people's experiences here and elsewhere, I'm wondering if I'll get fed the same discredited horse **** there.If the course was just an hour a week I'd go along to the first session and decide after that but this is a single session which takes up most of a Saturday. Firstly that doesn't sound great because you can't go away and come back to the next session with questions and secondly, my weekends are particularly valuable at the moment because during the week I'm working in Jersey and so I only see my family at the weekends.So my questions are: is DESMOND worth the time investment in and of itself? If not is it worth attending anyway because it's the gateway to other resources (I have no idea what those might be) that makes it worth the price? Or should I just 'phone up and cancel and save time for the family and myself the stress of sitting through 6 hours of being told how great high carbohydrate diets are and that I should be resigned to my diabetes getting worse no matter what I do?
