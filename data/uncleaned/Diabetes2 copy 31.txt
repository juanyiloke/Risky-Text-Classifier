type 1 diabetic and need some advice   Hi, was only diagnosed Feb of this year. Im 22 and At first I literally thought nothing of it, kept and eye on what I ate and drank, but it never really sunk in that for the rest of my life Id be constantly watching what Id have to eat and not eat and how to manage being so high and hypos. Im so confused with my insulin intake in co ordination with the carbs I eat, I have to keep a diary now of how many carbs Im taking in, so they can put me on 4 injections a day instead of two. Im starting to feel terrible mood swings like other people mentioned on here and extreme fatigue. I didnt know if that was a symptom of diabetes? I need some advice from people who have had this disease for years and I feel cheeky to start complaining as Ive only had it a short while in comparison to others that have dealth with it for as long as Ive been alive. I get scared its going to cause complications with my heart as I already have a heart condition. I try to put on a brave face to family and friends and pretend that Im fine when really I would just like to sit and have an in depth chat with someone to clear the questions I have. Every day I think of questions. I get scared at work when I can feel a hypo coming on and often think people dont take me seriously when I say I need to stop and drink some juice and eat a few biscuits. I think that some people think Im being over dramatic. does anyone feel this way?really appreciate a chat
