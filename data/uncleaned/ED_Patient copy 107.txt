New oneHey, Im 19 and have recently spoken to my doctor and anxiety disorder. I think i ve had spells of this since i was 15 and main symptom is having a poor appitite, as i girl ive always worried about my weight, but this symtom has come back and it feels worse than it has done before. I do eat, i dont starve myself bt i eat less and less, but cant make myself eat things...if this makes sense.Would like some peopel who feel maybe on the same level to have a chat to, as its worrying me. i cant keep going through phases like this, can i?
