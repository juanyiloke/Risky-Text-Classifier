Diabetes Type 1 cover in Japan?Not sure if anyone has any experience on this but I'm struggling to get/find answersMy daughter (type 1) is going to Tokyo for a Uni study year in Japan in August this year, so of course we are concerned that she has local clinical cover. So far all I've been able to discover is that your able to take up to 1 months insulin supplies without a permit. you can obtain a import permit “yakkan shoumei” for longer term supplies and we can export/import on the same licence. However this seems to rely on the DHL/FeDex an essential supply, something that makes me feel uneasy. Does anyone have any practical experience in this regard
