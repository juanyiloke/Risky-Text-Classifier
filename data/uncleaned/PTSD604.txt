I hate the nightmaresPosted 3 days agoI have P.T.S.D. It could be a piece of music or a movement or something a person says.In the day I distract myself but I admit to taking a little bit of speed which makes me happy. My friend wants me to go to N.A. meetings but I say I don't want to stop speed. It not only makes me happy and able to function and work more plus not feeling sad.The days are ok but it is the nightmares that surface in the subconsious.How do people deal with it? Any ideas?
