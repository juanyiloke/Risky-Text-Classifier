I messed upI have messed up and now i am scared (quite rightly so) and just so angry with myself  This past week or so, we shall say a fortnight just to be sure, i have eaten badly. Carb intake has been high, sugary hasn't been great but all in all my eating has caused levels of between 15 - 25. I am scared of the long term issues, as well as the short term. Scared i won't live to be a lovely old age etc and trying to get my head in the game.I know exactly way i have been eating like this, it is no excuse whatsoever and i am ashamed. On Monday 16th it will be 2 years since we had to turn my dad's ventilator off. For the past 4 weeks i have been reliving my dad's final 7 weeks in ICU, in a coma and fighting for his life. Each day getting calls asking mum and i too rush in. He was fighting double pneumonia, his kidneys failing etc. I have basically because of the anniversary been reliving it and so i have been conforting eating. NO DAMN EXCUSE FOR IT!!!I don't want sympathy, this isn't why i am posting. But the slightest thing and i turn to food. I can do well for weeks/months then crash. Crash for about a fortnight. I HATE IT! and i'm not sure how to stop it. I keep telling myself off, telling myself what will happen etc it works to a point. My new DN isn't helpful, my partner is unhelpful, he tries but because of his own problems i am able to hide things from him and make it so he doesn't know how bad it is. Or to be honest, i don't think he grasps how serious things can get if i don't stop having high BS.I'm so good at other areas in life, but this. Nope, i fail.
