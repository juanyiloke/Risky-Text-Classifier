  greatly improvedhello everyone, my depression and anxiety have improved greatly over the last 2 months mostly due to a change in therapist, psychiatrist and meds, but it was you guys that kept me going until i finally found the help i needed. my new support team have done wonders with me, the therapist has opened my eyes to a whole new world that i thought i would never get to take part in. i've been happier then i can ever imagine, everything seems to be falling in place and when it doesn't i don't freak out anymore i find a way to fix it. the only sad thing is i have not been arround here at all because i said something that has made me ashamed to show up and post. but that is a cross i must bear alone. thanks for listening and remember if i can get better so can you, i came a long way from attempted suicide to how i am now and so can you.
