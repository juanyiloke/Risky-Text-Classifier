Hi I'm back....Hi Folks, sorry not been on the forum lately....... thought you might be interested in this 'news' story about me thouh I wont post a link to the Amazon page though that would be a bit rude and self indulgent of me after months of absence.......Perhaps the reason I haven't been on so much lately is everything is pretty good with my T2 lately after some good advice regarding S/R metformin, seems my control (and other side effects) is a lot a better than it was on the old normal metformin
