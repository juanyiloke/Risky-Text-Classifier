ÊCould I be bulimic and not know it?For the majority of my life I felt that bulimia was strictly eating large amounts of food and purging afterwards. I recently found out that purging doesn't have to be part of it.ÊI've always loved to eat, especially unhealthy foods. I also know that it is some sort of compulsion especially when I'm out. If there is an opportunity to buy food I can't pass it up (it is the only issue I have with spending too much money), even if I've already eaten. Even so, I have a very small appetite so I never eat food in large quantities so I never consider myself to binge.ÊThen there are times where I can go through a whole day without eating hardly anything. I don't purposely starve myself but I do think about it as making up for all the high calorie foods I do eat, and sometimes I'm almost proud of myself for doing it.Sometimes, but not always, my lack of eating is due to feeling nauseated for unknown reasons.ÊI don't have problems with my image as in a feel like I'm too fat. I actually think I'm the perfect weight right now. But I have an extreme fear of gaining weight. I think the only reason that I am able to maintain this weight despite the type of food I eat is because of my small appetite and the days where don't eat.I have been diagnosed with depression, but I don't feel bad about myself for the way I eat.Could this be considered bulimia?
