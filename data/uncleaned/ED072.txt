StruggingHi my name is Kate and I am new to this site. I just recently celebrated 8 months of sobriety from gambling, alcohol and drugs. I have struggled with a relationship with food my whole life. Recently in the last two months things have gotten really out of control. I have been going back and forth between binging and purging and most recently restricting. I was referred to an eating disorder place where I am currently doing individual outpatient treatment. I feel like it's making my eating disorder worse. But at the same time I don't want to do more. I feel like I have so little support when it comes to my eating disorder. I feel like a complete failure that I can't snap out of it and get my life together. I feel like everyone around me is sick of all my problems and getting frustrated with me. I feel like that even includes professional support. It makes me so sad and it makes me hate myself so much. I am sick of letting my eating disorder take control of my life but at the same time the voice is so loud and I keep choosing to do it. I also don't seem to worry because I am still overweight even though I have dropped a large/unhealthy amount of weight fast. I feel really hopeless and defeated by all this...
