Post radiotherapy effectsI had my last radiotherapy session on 12th May and all through it I didn't really have any side effects apart from a bit of itching. About 10 days after an itchy rash appeared on my breast and under it and this has gradually got a bit worse. My scar under my armpit is also very red and sore although it doesn't itch because it is numb there. I have been applying E45 all the time and hydrocortisone cream that the onc prescribed but it doesn't seem to be clearing up. I was told I may get a sunburn effect but this isn't like that. Also, why is my scar affected Has anyone else experienced this and is it normal?
