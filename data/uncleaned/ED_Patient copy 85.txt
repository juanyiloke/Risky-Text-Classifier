Do I have an ED?I'm a 14 female, 5'1, and 100 pounds (healthy weight for my height). Over the past three months I have lost about 19 pounds. At first when it started I was eating around 400-500 calories a day and I dropped the majority of the 19 lbs by doing that. I then realized how unhealthy that was so I made an effort to eat more. I allow myself around 1400 calories a day and I ALWAYS count my calories. I won't eat something if I don't know how many calories are in it. I exercise every day and never have a meal above 400 calories. Luckily, I don't purge, but I do chew and spit sometimes. I'm really upset I've become so obsessive. I just want to be normal before this gets worse. What should I do?
