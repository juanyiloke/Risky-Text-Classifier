Asthma and Traveling to Ireland________________________________________I live in the US (the Midwest) and have a moderate case of asthma. I haven't traveled much since getting asthma a couple years ago. I am planning a trip to Ireland in September. Do any of my fellow asthmatics have experience visiting Ireland? I get nervous that my lungs will act up in a foreign country.I'm also not thrilled about a 7 hour flight but I am going to bring in a mask in case there is stinky perfume close by.Any feedback or advice would be awesome! This would be my first trip overseas.
