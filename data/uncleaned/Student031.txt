Is it the right decision to leave?by ChelseaM28Hi all,I started Children's Nursing at uni in September. I have had a few hiccups with feeling a bit like perhaps I didn't want to do the course, feeling homesick etc, but I dealt with it mostly ok.After coming back after Christmas, I had my first placement to start. I had a bad day at placement but still it could have been worse. I just had a complete breakdown and thought I cannot do this. I have had anxiety in the past and it has just flared up so, so badly. I drove home last Thursday to my boyfriend and felt so much better when I was home with him and my family.I felt positive over the weekend and ready to try so hard to stay, but it comes to the night before placement and every time I just breakdown again (even though it's not that bad!) I don't know why I do it. I feel like for my health maybe an option is to leave and return next year or the year after..I've had some of the best times of my life here at uni, but I know that's mostly to do with the friends I've made, clubs I've joined etc. I feel like I can't cope anymore, but at the same time feel like I will be gutted if I leave.How do I know what the right decision is? Any advice greatly appreciated
