Lchf induced insulin resistanceSo, just a heads up for those on LCHF and thinking of having a cheat day... Been very low carb since Jan 7th this year for weight and BG control and it's been great thus far. Thought I'd have a measured lunch of rice and king prawns just for old times sake yesterday and I've only just recovered from the BG rollecoaster.Moral of the story? If your low carbing and plan on having an excursion from your normal routine be prepared for some unpredictable results, you may need a lot more insulin then normal (for your first few carb laden meals??). I'm back to LCHF now
