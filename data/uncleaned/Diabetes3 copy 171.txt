Colds, do they wipe you out?HiI've had a head cold for a week and as i am due a back operation in 8 days i have felt the need to rest more and take extra care of myself. This weekend i have felt totally shattered and have slept most of it in bed, BMs have been slightly elevated but I've kept drinking water/tea and tested about 24 times in 48 hours. Do any of you find that you are wiped out by a head cold? My mum and fiancé have been pestering me to promise them that i won't go into work Monday i work on reception in a university and the front door continually opens and lets cold air in they are afraid that i might catch another cold on top of a cold? Is this medically possible and they are afraid because my op could be cancelled postponed if still have cold. Am I being silly. I want to work to show my employer that i can do part time hours this week but another part of me is afraid to risk anything. Your thoughts would be very much appreciated. Thank you
