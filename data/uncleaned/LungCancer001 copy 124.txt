Hi everyone new memberRecently found out I have lung cancer and emphysema. I have a bad back and complained to my pain management Dr that my upper back is now giving me pain and he ordered a x-ray and thats when a spot showed up. Following week had a CT scan and one week later had a PET scan and a PFT. I didnt have a bone scan and was wondering if that sound normal with the other test that I've had.Dr wants to do surgery and a lobectomy and befor he does that he will do the biopsy.The surgery will be a VATS and said I will be in the hospital for 3-4 days barring any problems. Part of PET scan report says upper lobe shows an 11x11 MM spiculated lesionwith significantly increased FDG uptake, also is again noted right apical scarring with a curvilinear configuration and masslike medial component measuring around 10x6 MM with increased FDG uptake. Sorry this is so long and thank you for the reply.
