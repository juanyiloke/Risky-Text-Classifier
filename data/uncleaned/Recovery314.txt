Beating this together.After a few false dawns & slip ups Im finally ready to post in here. As amaeru & I are getting better together & ARE together we thought wed share a thread. am has posted on her dealing with self-esteem thread but will put a link here too to keep it together.Ill start with where I was, where I am now & how I got there. Hopefully where Im going. This is the intro as it will be quite long but have never been fully able to get it all together.Will put trigger warnings when needed. Thanks all........
