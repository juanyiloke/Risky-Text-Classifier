Trying To Understand Relapses In SymptomsI've had quite a long run in which my symptoms were non-existent most of the time and when they did come up, I have been able to manage them and stop them from escalating.Then about 4 weeks ago I felt on edge and anxious, and I took action to manage that, which I did. But then a week or so ago something did trigger me and I lost control of my mind and wasn't able to manage to stop it escalating. I could feel myself sliding and was unable to stop it or to grasp how to manage it = the PTSD took control.The past couple of days have been like being back several years. The only difference being is that I know what's wrong with me, so today I'm picking up a bit and dissociating less, and am doing the things I need to do to manage my symptoms. But why did I lost that ability, what happened?
