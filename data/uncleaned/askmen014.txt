Need advice on re-locating / finding a job out of state2014-04-15, 10:26 AMI am looking to re-locate from the Northeast to a particular state southwest, both for better job opportunities and better climate (both temperature and tax/liberty climate).Has anyone had experience with searching for jobs out of state and relocating as a result? Are companies willing to interview, let alone look at your resume with an out of state address? Or is it better to just drop everything and move to the new state without any leads or solid prospects set up and risk long-term unemployment?My re-lo assistance would be minimal as I already have access to housing where I wish to go.Thanks!
