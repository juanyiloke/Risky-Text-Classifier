Overwhelming depressionI've never posted here before, and I'm probably being overly dramatic. I had a horrible doctor's appt where pretty much everything I said was invalidated (and I'm a physician, so I'm not used to this) and my doctor yelled, literally yelled at me, told me I was going to do whatever he told me to, whether I liked it or not or thought it right for me or not and if I didn't I'd be kicked out of the entire university system (I'm not even sure that's within his control), but if I stop seeing him, I lose my therapist, whom I'm very much attached to because they're in the same PCP clinic and I just couldn't handle that, so I'm stuck. He said he was going to have one of my treatment stopped, which would literally kill me. When I said that, he just shrugged and said "I guess so". And If I lose all my providers, I will likely die (I have a lot of medical problems). My doctor told me I was crazy and he was tired of dealing with me and he didn't care what happened to me. I don't care if I lose him, but I couldn't stand losing my other providers. If I lose my therapist, I will kill myself. I have no question about that. I just don't know what to do. I've never been treated so badly by anyone in my entire life. I've spent the last two days in bed, crying and taking way too much klonopin because that's the only way I can get through the day. I don't know what to do. If anyone has any words of advice, I'd love to hear them. I'm been some pretty horrible things in my life, and this is close to the worst thing I've every been through. I honestly have my doubts I'm going to make it through.ÊThanks in advance.
