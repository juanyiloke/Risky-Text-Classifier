Anxiety meds effecting menstrual cycle??Okay, so I have a situation that I really need some advice on - everyone around me is tired of hearing it and not all that helpful anyways. I was taking Effexor for my GAD. It was going well for a while, helping me to function normally without constant dread and fear. However, my insurance company stopped paying for the medication so I was unable to continue taking the meds. Now, if you've ever taken effexor, you know the lovely withdrawal symptoms that come with missing a dose of the pill or weening off it entirely. I stopped taking the effexor cold turkey around the 27th of July. I went through the withdrawal symptoms for about a week and was finally feeling better around the 7th of August. What I'm wondering is, do you think the effexor is affecting my period? I think it's pretty late but I'm uncertain because I don't write down when I start and end my period(which I'm going to start now!). I believe I may have been ending it around the 6th or 7th of July. So I'm uncertain of the time line, but I think my period is over a week late or more. First thought that came to mind was, "crap, am I pregnant!?" But I took a pregnancy test the 13th of this month and another one the 19th - both negative. My boyfriend, mom, and friends aren't helpful at all and are tired of my constant need for reassurance so I'm not really sure what think. I'm on birth control and with 2 negative tests I'm really thinking it isn't pregnancy(really hoping actually). I'm thinking maybe it's stress that's delaying it or that stopping the effexor so abruptly may have affected it? I'm panicking, even with the 2 negatives and no pregnancy symptoms, because of my GAD, which adds to the stress and isn't helping. Has anyone had any similar experiences or has any idea of what may be causing my late period? :shrug::panic::BLAH::scratch:
