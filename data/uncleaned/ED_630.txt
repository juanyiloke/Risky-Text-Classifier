When to be concerned?I'm struggling and I'm just wondering when I should be concerned from a physical perspective? Should I be concerned at all? Should I be going to my GP? I don't know what I can and can't say on here in terms of behaviours that I'm using, I don't want to trigger or break the rules. I know that doesn't leave you with much info but I am really struggling with intake right now. I don't want to cause a fuss by going to the doctors unless I need to.ÊThanks.
