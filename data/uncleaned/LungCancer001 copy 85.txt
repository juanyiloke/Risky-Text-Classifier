biopsy results tomorrowI went to an immediate care clinic last weekend with a hoarse voice and trouble swallowing liquids. I had been to my doctor complaining of back and chest pain about a week before that. I had an appointment set up with a cardiologist. The immediate care doctor did an EKG and it was abnormaland sent me to the er. Further testing included CAT on head and chest, stress, and regular chest X-ray. Heart is fine but CAT revealed a 6cm mass on my left hilar. Had a biopsy (broncospity-sp? ) last week. Tomorrow will hear the diagnosis. I've been doing research and getting more and more sad and depressed. I've been a smoker for forty years so I have brought this on myself. I have this attitude of "the damage is done" and am feeling very sorry for myself. I am also a 10-year breast cancer survivor. I know it is some sort of lung cancer and can't get past this poor me attitude. I just want to get this over with. It is 2pm and I haven't even gotten dressed yet today.
