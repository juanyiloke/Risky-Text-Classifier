Food.I binge eat and it's awful. It's not just once or twice a week, but pretty much every day. I don't even know why I do it. I'm not eating on feelings or anything, because most of the time I'm perfectly happy, but I love food and have no will power. I get lots of food in, because I get anxious if I don't have nice food to munch. By nice food I mean chocolate and crisps and everything else that has contributed to making me massively overweight. My weight will start affecting my health. I'm OK at the moment, but I'm at risk of diabetes and heart disease and cancer and joint problems and all of the other crap that comes with being morbidly obese.ÊI saw a personal trainer today. I have some money from when my Nan died and I am trying to do positive things with it. I had swimming lessons with some of it, bought a macbook and now I'm going to have some sessions with her. She was really, really lovely. She's given me a food diary to fill in though and I'm terrified. She says she makes small changes gradually, so I think that'll be OK. I just don't want her to see all the awful things I eat, but at the same time, lying to her is not going to help.ÊI'm scared of change. I like eating exactly what I want. I don't have an eating disorder at all, but I lovelovelove all of the wrong foods and not being able to eat them in the quantities that I want to makes me feel anxious. I feel embarrassed to admit that, because in my case, it really is a lack of discipline rather than a mental health issue. The only issue I have is that my weight is affecting my physical health. I don't even particularly mind that I look fat. I'm not out to attract anyone and I can buy nice clothes, so that's all OK.Any advice? Encouragement? A smack round the head to tell me to get a grip? Similar experiences? Anything welcome. :)
