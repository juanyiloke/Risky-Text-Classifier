StupidityÇÊon:ÊFebruary 19, 2011, 02:17:08 PM ÈI totally agree with everything said, I had to enrol my children in a London school in the middle to late 60's. I had taught all my children simple arithmetic and their ABC (not phonetically) and to read and write their own name (later even though their teachers did not ask I also made the children learn their times tables by rote in rhyme). I was always chided by the teaching staff for causing my children confusion as they were the experts and they knew how to 'teach'. Later I moved to Kent, all my children needed to attend classes designed to bring their reading skills up to scratch and my daughter had to have specialist teaching as she was dyslexic. The dyslexia I had flagged up with the London school and they had dismissed me as being unqualified to put the view forward, suggesting that she saw a Psychologist; my husband at the time vetoed this suggestion. Later I made sure my last son had all my attention I taught him to do all the things I could, not all was taken in by him, but he gained a good degree in English Literature, and can cook and clean with great attention is very employable, not being out of work throughout his University tenure, gaining full time employment with his university, he took a leap of faith and is now pursuing his dream to make films, this he is doing reasonably successfully in a small way, only time will tell if he is to make a complete success.
