Should I undergo RT? Hi all, I   the below as a response to another conversation but probably should have started a new conversation - so here it is.Any thoughts/experiences/advice very welcome! "I'm trying to decide weather to go for it (RT) or not. A year ago scans showed mets in my spine but after a year on hormones - much to my Consultant's surprise, and my delight - a new scan has revealed that they are now "all but gone and if it wasn't for my previous history on file might even be regarded as just 'wear and tear' do to age" Great news at it now means Consultant feels it is worth trying to cure the disease rather than just long term manage.It's a hard choice though because, with the hormones I'm pretty much ok and unaffected day to day 9bit of tiredness, hot flushes but that's it. Whereas I'll be honest, the potential side effects of RT have frightened me a tad. I don't mind what I go through during treatment if it wears off. it's the longer term problems that may crop up further down the line that I worry about - even though I know that the chances are low.I'm probably being daft as the chance of a complete cure as opposed to long term 'management' (which will ultimately start to fail) has to be grabbed. Right?"Cheers.Sammy.
