Good ThingsI have been keeping a journal of "Good Things" that happen each day since I got out of the hospital last week, and it is helping me to be positive. Anyone want to list a good thing that has happened to you today or any day? Today I:-Had a job interview-helped my grandma clean her house-answered a phone call from a nurse from my insurance company who wants to help me find a therapist and pdoc-am making dinner for my familyEven just these little things make me feel hopeful about the future and positive about moving on.
