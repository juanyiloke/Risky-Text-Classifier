would it make sense to downsize2012-03-05, 09:43 PMI am about 5 years away from possible retirement (31 years at 55)owe about 40k on my house but believe I should be able to pay it off with a lump some within 2 yearsI am looking at a smaller house which is priced at about 50k less then what my house was appraised atI believe I would like to move from the area it would be nice to have no mortgage less taxes and less money invested in this areayet I prefer not to move into a rental property as opposed to buying the smaller housewould it make sense to downsize ?you cannot expect me to be governed by the laws of a society that has rejected me
