Any of you Schizophrenics out there own a knife? I'm talking combat knife around 12 inches, or just maybe a pocket knife of any kind, im kind of afraid to own one because if i were to go psychotic i don't want one of those easily accessible in front of my desk or in view of me. I cant account for kitchen knives, but they are in a drawer out of sight in the kitchen. Not that i am violent while psychotic, worst thing i did was punch someone...but you never know. Although i guess im being a bit paranoid here because i drive a car a little bit, and i could go psychotic while driving and die...or kill someone in the process...i am on meds but Ive heard some people relapse even on meds, like the meds just stop working over time...so you never know...
