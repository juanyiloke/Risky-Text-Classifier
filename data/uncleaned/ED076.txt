In need of a buddy!Hey :) My name is Sofia and I'm 21 years old. I've been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa 4 months ago but I've been struggling a lot while on recovery... I've not gained a lot of weight because I continue to restrict my intake almost everyday.The thing is: I REALLY want to recover because I actually love food. I was so happy when I was younger, I ate whatever I felt like...I miss those days :( Some days when I feel like I can beat this ED and I eat the “unhealthy” food I used to love, but the next day my orthotrexia hits me and I feel so horrible and fat that I restrict again.. It's so frustrating :(I'm kind of scared but I am looking into a recovery program and every night I try to convince myself that I should try it but in the morning I just can't seem to commit myself...Maybe if I'm not doing this alone, I'll be able to recover ^^Anyone up for supporting me??
