Êfeel like a fake.i am gonna ring up to see if i can get referred to therapy tomorrow, not necessary for an eating related matter.Êmy mum thinks i should mention my binging. but as i havent binged in like a week which i am very very happy with but i feel like a fake like there is nothing wrong with my eating now.Êi havent told anyone professionally about my binging before.Êi feel like i do need help with it as today i felt very wobbly and i now it is only a matter of time and i cant cope with how i feel after i have binged as it makes me feel so awful.
