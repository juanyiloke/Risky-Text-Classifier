ÊIntegral/Holistic view of schizophreniai personally take an integral/holistic view of my condition/experiences - bio/psycho/social/spiritual - that things are mediated across spirit - soul/psyche - physical body/brain - social/environmental. i don't see any either/or with it all, but rather that everything is interrelated & interdependent.Êimo Carl Jung spoke a lot of sense on all these matters, as have others.ÊCurrent mainstream psychiatry primarily focuses on the physical - the physical body/brain. Psychological & social elements often seem secondary to that, & the areas of the soul & spirit are usually excluded.ÊObviously it is impossible to argue a case for the spiritual with a materialist, as many now appear to be.Êi've spent the past 10 years on-line trying to raise awareness of & explore the spiritual in mental health, to little avail. Am interested in other people thoughts on the matter. Thanks.
