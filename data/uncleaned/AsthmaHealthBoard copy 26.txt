Shortness of breath - only symptom________________________________________Hello. I need some advice, please. I've been having severe shortness of breath for about one year. I thought it was because of my hypothyroidism and only now started doing lung investigations- my computer tomography shows nothing wrong, my lungs seem fine, and I don't have other asthma symptoms like wheezing or coughing. Only the bad shortness of breath, I can't yawn most of the time, I have moments when I don't have enough air to even sneeze. I did a spirometry and the results were bad, the doctors there kept telling me that I'm not trying hard enough and that I can't possibly have such bad results since I'm still able to walk around. My doctor is about to give me meds for asthma, and I'd like to know if any of you have been in a similar situation... Could this be asthma? What else could it possibly be? I'm really confused. Thank you T_T
