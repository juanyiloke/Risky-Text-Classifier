Chivalry/Gentlemans' EtiquetteThere are the long-held expectations of men of good character but which ones still apply today?For example my mother a couple of years ago let me know if was good manners if walking with a lady to be on the side of the path nearest the road or to allow a lady the side away from the road when passing if possible.ÊI'm just curious what other kinds of acts like this still apply in modern society. I will hold doors for a lady or less physically capable person but I don't universally expect a pleasant acknowledgement.ÊLeaving out gender equality as it would apply to disabled or elderly or any person who could benefit from some kind of assistance or courteous gesture what would these cover?ÊI'd like to point out that it's not limited to men to have this expectation on them but historically it has been in place.
