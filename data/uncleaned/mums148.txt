What are the signs?Ds1 is 2 years 4 months old. He is aware when he is literally doing a poo but doesn't seem to have a prior awareness that it's gonna happen.For the first time ever last week he told me he was doing a wee in his nappy. Not told me since though.We have had a potty in the bathroom for months but whenever we say "right let's sit on the potty and try for a wee" before his bath he just says NO and is not keen at all.I don't wanna beg/cajole/force him to sit on it if he doesn't want to. But toddlers never "want" to do things you suggest do they?! What if he never says "ok then"??Should I just leave it a month or two till it's warm and then buy some more potties for the garden/downstairs and have some pants-off time so he can get used to the feeling of wee coming out without a nappy to catch it?Just feel totally at a loss. Have always tried to follow my sons cues for when he is ready for things (solid food, big boy bed etc) but just not sure if I am reading all the signs wrong with this.Plus older family members appear scandalised that he is nearly 2 and a half and I haven't started yet  feel like I am failing him but have no idea where to start. Or even if I should start now. Help!
