Travelling  7  HiI'm going travelling for 5-6 months in Thailand, New Zealand and Australia and I was wondering if anyone had any hints and tips about how to keep insulin cool?Also was wondering how to get supplies out there as I won't be able to carry 6 months worth with me.I've been advised I may have to buy insulin out there as well as having to get Roche to dispatch pump supplies out to me but was wondering if anyone has been travelling and what they did?Thank you!Shannon
