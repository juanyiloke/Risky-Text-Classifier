Sugar Rush Every DayHi Community Please bear with me if you've heard this before I should visit more and I will do but I'm desperate.Diagnosed as Type 1 in 2013 and was coping great with excellent Blood Sugar results. Over the past 6 months I can't help myself forgetting I'm a diabetic and I eat so many sweet things I can't help myself. I know this is going to cause harm to my body everywhere but I'm find it increasingly difficult to stop myself. I know you guys might say where's your willpower but I'm doing it to lose weight.I've been told if my Blood Sugars are kept high the weight will drop off. I know I come across as someone who needs a slap and shake but really it's at a stage where I'm eating predominantly sugar based products. I then inject myself with mad dosage units to bring levels down.I don't eat anything from 8 in the morning till 7 when I finish work then I hit the sugar cupboard. Any advice or has anyone felt the same as me. Thanks guys.
