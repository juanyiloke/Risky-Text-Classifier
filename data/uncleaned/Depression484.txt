Stuck In The PastÊ  Doommantia ,Ê25 Apr 2015For the past 5-6 years all I've been longing for, is the past. The best years I ever had were when I was 16-19, I had a great social life, a girlfriend, I was going places, I had dreams. Then one year It all decided to go all wrong, it all decided to end and leave me lifeless and without anything. All what I had was replaced with crap.ÊI remember my first year of college (my best year without a doubt), I made heaps of new friends and I met who I thought was the love of my life. She was everything to me. We stayed together for almost 4 years until eventually she had enough of bearing witness to my self destruction. I don't know why I went down the path that I did, I didn't want this and certainly never asked for it.ÊÊI want to relive those years so bad, I want to ensure that I didnt make the choices that I did and everyday that I cannot do this I'm unhappy. I dont want the future. I dont want someone else. I want to be with her. Its not right.ÊOf course time travel isnt a thing and even if it was one can't undo what has been done, or has happened. I realise this, and yet even with this realisation I still cant help but feel these things. I maybe need to work on "getting over" her, but sometimes I dont want to.ÊÊWhen I think about those good years I get that butterfly feeling in my stomach and as if my head is going to burst open or something. Very weird feeling and not one that I like yet I continue to dwell on these years, why do I do this to myself?ÊI just needed to vent this.
