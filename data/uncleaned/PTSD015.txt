Building Resilience To Saying NoI have to say no to someone who is expecting me to come and visit them. It's my dad, a dominant (but not violent)man, and I'm finding it stupidly difficult.I don't care too much what he thinks of me personally anymore. But it bothers me that I feel so anxious about saying no, because I recognise that it is a danger for me when I take this kind of anxiety into other areas of life. It is an aspect of the violent and dominated relationships that I've had with partners.A big part of me wants to give up and just say yes so that I don't have to face the anxiety of saying no. But that's the kind of behaviour that enables unhealthy relationships to happen. So I feel like I have to do this as part of building resilience to saying no. But the way I'm feeling right now makes me realise how weak I am on this.I just wondered how others have built resilience to this kind of thing?
