Am I going crazy? Please read, its long but I need advice and help.Hi guys, I have battled anxiety disorder since I was 8 years old (currently 19) as well as depression from the age of 14. My worst experience was a couple years ago where I was suicidal and just completely lost myself to these mental issues. I learned to take control as best as I could and I am on pristiq (anti depressant) and when absolutely necessary I take ativan for my panic attacks. I was doing pretty good but I just moved from home and I am finding very challenging.I have always had a fear that I would go crazy or insane. I get lost in my head sometimes and don't really realize what is going on around me. Like my mind gets all "heavy" feeling and there is lots of pressure and I cant really focus, it gets worse when I have panic attacks but it usually lasts for weeks after. I am also a bit of a hypochondriac so every little thing that feels 'off' i freak out about.ÊBut just in the last week or so I cant shake this crazy feeling, I cant really describe it, maybe disoriented? It all started from a really bad panic attack one night and I have just felt off ever since? I feel lost, constantly worry about things that could go wrong with my body, I feel zombie like and slow, random dizzyness and just like I have no control over myself and thoughts.Sorry if this is long I just really need some advice and if anyone else ever feels this way please talk to me. I just want to know I am not alone and to be reassured I am not going insane. Logically I know I am not but its such a big fear that a lot of the time I forget about the logistics and go with my own thoughts.ÊBeing a hypochondriac I also fear that maybe I have a tumor or my brain is somehow dying.ÊI know its a lot to read but PLEASE. I need some advice and help.ÊIm just scared.
