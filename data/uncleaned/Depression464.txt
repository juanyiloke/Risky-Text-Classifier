Failing At School, Feeling Stressed.Ê  Eaglespeed ,Ê23 Apr 2015Hey guys.ÊIve never been diagnosed with depression, I have mild form of ocd but it's under control, but Ever since I had to leave my hometown and the situation in my country has detoriated, anyway that's in another thread, but it's related to my psychological well being,since I know I'm suffering from post traumatic disorder.ÊBasically I have been accepted into post graduate studies master degree in a university in egypt, started last November the pre master program which consists of mostly doing small assignments and studying subjects, finished the 1st semester and now toward the end of the 2nd semester, and my exams are after month.ÊProblem is I havnt attended for awhile now, I don't feel engaged. Running late on assignments and not feeling like studying at all.Materials are pilling up and i don't know what to do.ÊBy the way I'm a pharmacist and doing a master in clinical pharmacy, working in health care I'm pretty knowledgeable about disorders and psychological conditions, and aware of what I'm going through, war can mess u up pretty bad, u don't think much of it when u feel the shake and hear the sound of shelling explosions and seeing grad missles flying over ur house, Unit after awhile it starts coming back and hit u psychologically.ÊI don't want to drop out, I wanted to go post grad route but here so I'm not very motivated,especially when lacking financial and residential stability.ÊMy colleagues keep pursuing me but I'm ignoring their phone calls and messages.ÊAny advice would be helpful for anyone who went through same situations or similar.ÊThanks.Ê
