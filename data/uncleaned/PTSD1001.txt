This is my latest PTSD symptom. I've always had fine hair, but in the last six months it's been coming out in huge amounts. I'm supposed to be seeing a specialist (finally) next week. But so much damage is already done. As a female in the film/television industry, this trauma has devastated me socially, emotionally, physically and mentally. And now my hair is falling out. Has anybody else experienced this? Do medications really bring your hair back? I've heard that some PTSD patients never get a full head of hair again. Anybody out there? S.
