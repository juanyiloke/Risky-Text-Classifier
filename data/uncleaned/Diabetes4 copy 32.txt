Health App ChallengeI hope you might be interested in taking part or helping me raise awareness of the Health App Challenge. The Health App Challenge invites you to review or create your own app (mobile, websites or social media) for diabetes or weight loss management.Review an app We are inviting reviews of apps you have used for diabetes or weight loss management. It only takes a few minutes to add your review to our website and here you can see what other apps people are using at www.healthappchallenge.org.ukWe’ll soon be adding patient designed/created apps for you to review and each review will be entered into our prize draw to win £200.Design/develop an app Have a great idea for an app to help with diabetes or weight loss management? We can help you develop it with our support team offering technical, medical and intellectual property advice.

We’re awarding £100 for showcasing mock-ups, £300 for apps and offering £200 for the best one reviewed on our website.
