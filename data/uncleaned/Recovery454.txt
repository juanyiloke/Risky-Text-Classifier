  Not a bad dayValentine's day. It wasn't particularly good, but this was set to be my first Valentine's day since my breakup about half a year ago, and I already don't really like the day. I was expecting it to be pretty  sucky, but it turned out to be not that bad.I managed to make my best  friend smile  even though she also really hates this day. Not to mention her breakup was only about a month ago and she's still a bitdepressed  about it.That smile was good enough for me I think. Looks  like this year's Valentine's day went okay.
