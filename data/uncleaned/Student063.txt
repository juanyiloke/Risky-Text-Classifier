Over itby emma-atheneI have two years left at university, which is a long time or a short time depending on how you look at it.I hardly ever study anymore, I procrastinate into oblivion, I have mental health issues and I am really just sick of university and sick of failing myself. I'm in my fourth year at the moment.I don't know how I will get a job once I graduate - I don't think I'm very employable - I am nervous around people and don't feel like I've learned anything in all the time I've spent at university. Who on Earth is going to want to hire me? I wouldn't want to hire me.Has ANYBODY ever felt like this? I feel totally alone, and pathetic. I don't know how to break this vicious cycle. I literally never study.
