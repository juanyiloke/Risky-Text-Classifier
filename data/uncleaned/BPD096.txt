Who would you kill?by -----SGRMAN----- » Sat May 23, 2015 1:39 amokay if you can excuse the melodrama, I'll get to the premise of the question. Is the suffering your psychological condition causes you your own fault, or the fault of others? Do you now have borderline personality disorder because of the accumulation of bad decisions you have made up until now; or is it the result of the way others have treated you especially during early childhood?The answer is that whilst you have probably contributed to your own suffering; the main reason is that others have treated you poorly and this results in your recurrent suffering . Whilst you were abused as children, or neglected, other people KNEW and CHOSE to do NOTHING! What a funny world we live in, people are killed, children are ###$ and no one cares. I'm so sorry that the world doesn't give a ###$ about you. It is truly tragic. So the question is: If our lives are so tragic, should we not at least make it tragic for all of the people that have CAUSED our suffering?
