Why Can't I Hang Up?I hate posting here because I have such a hard time communicating my own feelings. I can respond to other people's posts, but starting one myself is a horrible experience. I don't know why.ÊThis last weekend my ex wife asked me if I would get her in touch with my daughter, her step daughter. I told her no, because my daughter didn't want contact. She was abusive toward my daughter and also blamed her for our marital problems. My ex wanted to argue about it, and I spent 5 hours on the phone with her trying to make sense of it. Nothing I said made a difference. This is hauntingly familiar. I went through similar painful conversations with other people.This always leaves me in the worst place. So, why can't I just hang up the phone? Why do I think a few more words will make the difference? Does anyone else do this?
