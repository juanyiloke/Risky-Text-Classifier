Blood Sample?Hi- I've just joined the club and have a few questions if anybody can advise?I suspect I've got problems as I've been sweating and urinate frequently off and on, especially during the last 3 weeks on holiday with eating rich food and plenty of lager.I'll just ask one question at a time.I have an appointment to give a blood sample, but I have drastically cut down on Carbs over the last 48 hours.  Would this effect a true reading and should I continue with my usual diet until after the sample?Regards Brian
