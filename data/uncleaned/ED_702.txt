After vacationHi, I just came back after 3 week long vacation. I went to my home country and also travelled with few friends. It was all exciting and great but it was an active holiday. we spent just 2 nights in the same place, running around and trying to see as much as possible. Also, food at this country was really spicy and it was not easy to buy something European, so we didn't eat a lot. My friends didn't have a problem with this as they were all happy to lose a bit of weight but I took it really hard.ÊI'm underweight as it is and if I don't eat regularly, it's easy to lose. I lost some weight and I'm at my lowest weight in years. I tried eating as much as I could but it was really hard with all the traveling and I couldn't eat random stuff from the street as this was Asian country and the quality of street food is questionable.ÊNow I'm back at work and I can't recover. I'm sleepy all the time, can't go to the gym as I have no energy (I actually went yesterday, stepped on the treadmill and realized I'll crash so went home immediately) and I'm hungry. I don't know how to proceed now, how to recover after vacation. I know it should be the other way around, I should be relaxed after holiday but since it was really active holiday, I got back even more tired than I left. And I'm really scared because of my weight now....Can someone give any advise on how to proceed and reverse the damage? I'm clueless and just wanna go home and sleep :(
