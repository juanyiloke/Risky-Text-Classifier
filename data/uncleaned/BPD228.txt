ÊDesperate for MotivationHi,ÊIt hasn't been a good week this week!..I've been taking one day at a time and my low mood still hasn't lifted!It seems the more I read about PD and therapy sessions I have the more difficult it becomes to live with it!..Had my day planned for weeks with a friend but just can't face it so I have cancelled, the everyday routine of having a shower and getting dress is too much!Do I force myself or wait for it to pass?....have so much I could be doing but just can't motivate myself.Struggling to even think straight, my head is a muddle!!!!
