Amlodipine and BP issuesI'm slightly concerned about Amlodopine, I take 10 mg a day plus 8mg Doxyzosin and Lisinopril (silly me, it's all in my signature). A lot of what you mention sounds very familiar and I've just thought it was me, rather than something I was taking to keep my BP down. On the bright side, before I read this, over the last week or two, I started having slightly dizzy spells, nothing serious, just slightly wobbly. My Diastolic is about 60 (constant) and my systolic seems to fluctuate between 120 and 170 (not so great), heart rate 65 all the time. My father had similar issues and despite 3 doctors with different diagnosis, nursey had it right, side effect of Amlodopine. Note to self, after TKR next Tuesday, see GP re BP meds. This message has convinced me to try something else. Thanks
