The Lantus Saga part 500I'm getting a better grip of what the Lantus or my body is up to, so I wanted to know if this mirrors anyone else's experience or if I'm actually going slightly insane now  As far as I can tell I am having six hourly peaks in Lantus activity. I've identified this by playing with the timing of the injection. This happened accidentally really because the reduced dose of Lantus the consultant recommended had me going too high in the morning because it was clearly running out. When I was injecting at 7:30am I knew I was having some peak activity of some sort at 7:30pm because any physical activity made me hypo and I struggled to get my blood sugar to stay stable, and another peak at 1:30am which was my special hypo time. In order to counteract the pre breakfast peak on the much reduced dose I started injecting at 5:30am. This resulted in much lower readings which is good but a slight hypo before lunch at around 11:30am and then much much higher readings at the two hour post lunch point, but a dive into the fours at 5:30pm so I can't correct the lunchtime peak by adjusting the ratio because that makes the 5:30pm slot a hypo rather than a low four. My special hypo time is now 11:30pm it seems so if I'm having one that's when it happens. I have deduced that previously I was having a Lantus peak at around 1:30pm which was helping keep the post lunch reading down. It's like clockwork every six hours, it's quite freaky. So have I lost my sanity? Could it actually be peaking every six hours...it's like Groundhog Day
