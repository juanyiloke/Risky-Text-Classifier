Rant Alert - NHS GuidanceHow can you hang your hat on A1C results and a single daily reading? I care for both of my parents and the diabetes nurse has just swung by to do reviews. How can readings in the early to mid teens night after night be acceptable to anybody? I get my parents are old, I get they have other health problems, but frankly a whole ton of those are as a result of never having good blood sugar control. Neuropathy, retinopathy, vascular issues etc but I get no back up on levels whatsoever.I saw the childhood complications headlines on the news yesterday morning, is it any wonder, seriously, is it any wonder at all?Rant over. Just going to go and scream somewhere loudly for an hour or two.......Ali
