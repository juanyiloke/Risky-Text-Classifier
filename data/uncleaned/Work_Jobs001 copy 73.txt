Bonus payment and resignation________________________________________So, I've handed in my notice and will be changing jobs soon.Now, our bonuses are paid at the end of March, and I'm leaving in the middle of March, so I'm having a disagreement with HR regarding payment. I believe I'm technically correct in what I'm saying, but they disagree, the situation is as follows;I've been working here several yearsMy contract states we receive a bonus, but doesn't give any conditions around it's payment.The bonus paid in March 2015 is based on performance for Jan to Dec 2014I've met all my targets and received a very good review from my manager. The (outdated) employee handbook doesn't mention any conditions about the bonus.I've received a bonus every other year and no conditions were ever communicated regarding payment.I handed in my notice after checking all of the above, knowing that I would be finishing mid-month and we are paid at the end of the month.A week /after/ I handed in my notice, there's an email from the head of the company, stating what the bonus % will be this year and the 3 conditions required for payment. I meet the other 2, but 1 is that you must be employed on the date of payment.On this basis, HR are saying I'm not entitled to the bonus since I'm leaving mid-month. My argument is that they communicated this fact too late (after I had given notice) and that I should still receive it since I am getting paid that month (It would be different if I'd left in January and was looking for a bonus to be paid to me in March, or if they'd communicated the conditions earlier)I know, the simplest and smartest thing would have been to push my start date with new company to beginning of April, but I was 50/50 on whether there would be any bonus at all this year anyway, so didn't want to make a fuss with the new employer about pushing out the start date.As far as I know, there's no legal standing for bonuses and they are paid at the discretion of the employer, so I realise I don't really have any choice but to accept what they say, but am I just being a greedy asshole, or is what I'm saying reasonable?(I've emailed HR with my counter-argument as to why I should get paid the bonus, but they are taking so long to reply that I may have to escalate it to that person's manager, but I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle)
