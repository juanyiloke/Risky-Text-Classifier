LCHF one week and amazing progressHi all,Hubby has now been on lchf diet for a week and blood glucose around 7 from 15+ before. The best bit is that he is enjoying the diet, doesn't feel hungry at all and for me the most amazing change is that he has now taken a big interest in the carb values when at the supermarket. He has never in our 32 years together shown any interest in either food shopping or what he was eating! He was so tired and quite low in mood with aches and pain in his legs. He is now feeling so much better and has lots more energy and enthusiasm for doing things. He has ordered some b12 tablets too as it is probably still very low. Was 210 a year ago and that was just before he started taking metformin.Thanks for all the great advice on here. It has made such a difference and as he feels so much better and not hungry he says he has no worries about lchf diet as a positive long term way of eating.
