Is It More Than Depression?Ê  mzungu ,Ê02 May 2015I haven't been able to stick to any doctor or medication long enough to know. I don't even think I've been diagnosed with anything, even though I've been dealing with this for half my life.. I go to the doctor at my university whenever I'm in crisis and she prescribes me something. I take it until the prescription runs out and then don't go back. I do this with almost everything in my life.ÊI've suspected I have PTSD after two terrible things happened in 2 years.. but the depression was already there. Now I'm worried it's also ADHD or OCD or something... Looking for advice here.ÊI can't DO anything. I have sat in my room for 4 days now slowing working on a list of goals... which I never actually get around to. The conditions to start something never feel right. I can't even clean my room... it always feels like the wrong time even though I think about it all day. I can't flip the pages on the calendar even though I've thought about doing it for days.ÊAlmost every one of my assignments for university I rush through on the day it's due, or hand it in late.ÊÊOne of my goals is to run a half marathon next year. I can't go outside and run. I just write it as a "to do" on different lists I make. I spend my entire day planning out my life but the conditions never feel "right" to start, if that makes sense.ÊAnother of my goals is to go to law school, and to do that I need to take the LSATs... In my mind I fixate on my desk not being clean, so I can't study. And I sure as hell can't clean my desk. I just write it on my to do list.ÊI've wasted a lot of years in this thought cycle.ÊÊI'm sorry if this is convoluted and rant-y. I'm so frustrated because I've spent another day in bed obsessing over planning my life and not living it. It's pathetic.ÊAnyone else deal with this sort of thing?
