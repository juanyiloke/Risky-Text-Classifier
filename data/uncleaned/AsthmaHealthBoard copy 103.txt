quarterly pest control spraying in apartment? help please!!!________________________________________Hello, I moved into my first apartment a few months ago, such a nice little cheap apartment, they're older, built in the 70s. I was never told about quarterly pest control spraying but I got a note on my door last night that they will be coming in between 11am to 3pm and it should take a couple mins, odorless and "quite safe for humans" and is the same thing used in hospitals/emergency rooms. I have worked hard to keep chemicals out of my life for my asthma and terrible allergies, extremely chemical sensitive too. And that I don't need to be there or prepare my apartment for it. Has anyone dealt with this before? I am going to call them and ask if they can skip my apartment as I have never had one single insect in it since I moved in, I think they're just paranoid. I'm vegan, I use no harsh chemicalsonly natural when cleaning and I really am upset I was not told about this. I just want to know if anyone has dealt with this and has been okay after and no allergic/asthmatic reactions. I am getting my allergy shot now and the nurse said they can't give me a dr note for an excuse not to spray in my apartment  Thank you soo much for anyone that replies.
