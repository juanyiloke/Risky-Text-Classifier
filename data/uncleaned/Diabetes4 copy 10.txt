Marks and Spencer' Sugar Free' SweetsHello all,I thought I would pick your brains as to what you believe constitutes 'sugar free'A couple of months ago I impulse purchased some 'Sugar Free' Rhubarb and Custard sweeties from Maarks and Spencer, they are delicious and I found myself pleasantly surprised at how much better sugar free sweets had become since I last tried them.Fast forward to yesterday and I happily finished the last sweet on the train on the way home (I only have one or 2 a day for fear of the aspartame effect!) and I'm casually reading the box and notice to my horror that the carb content is listed as 89.9g per 100g, 0 of which sugarsHow can this be classed as sugar free?
