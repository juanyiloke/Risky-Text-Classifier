Relapsed =(.Hi everyone, I'm new here (already made a post in introductions  ) and I was diagnosed with Anorexia 4 years ago. I did go to treatment though and was in remission but I've currently relapsed and am now back in the throes of my ED. I'm not looking to recover right now, I'm more interested (or obsessed I guess you could say) in losing as much weight as possible in the shortest amount of time. But I feel like I've failed and I live with my dad, sister and boyfriend. I've told my boyfriend that I've relapsed but I haven't told my dad, even though I kind of want to but at the same time I don't because my ED has always been a secret. I've only told my boyfriend because as sick as it sounds and mean too I guess, I want him to watch what's going to happen, I want him to see me get thin again. I supposed that comes from one of the reasons why I've relapsed in the first place. Lately my boyfriend hasn't been spending any time with me at all. He's always either in the barn or watching tv in his room. Never really sees me for more than an hour a day and even when I go into his room to try and spend time with him he's more interested in the tv or facebook on his phone then he is talking to me. So I suppose I figure that if I lose enough weight he'll spend time with me again, don't get me wrong it's not that I'm doing this for attention, it's never been about that. But I just want to know how everyone deals with the feelings that come up with a relapse and how to try and tell one of your parents that you're having problems with food and weight. I'm really confused and in pain right now and don't really know what to do.
