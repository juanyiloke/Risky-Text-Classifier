Over 65 and still workingHello Ladies and Gents,I hope you don't mind this message on your forum but I am a researcher working for the BBC. We are doing a piece on the news on people who are over 65 and still working. There are now over a million such workers in the economy and growing. We think it is an interesting subject and I hope you might be able to help. Please do message me if you are in that position and don't mind having a chat with me, and possibly doing an interview.I am looking in particular for people who are a) working because they have to - because of financial reasons, b) working because they have to but may not really want to, and c) working because they can and are able.Thanks very much,Daf
