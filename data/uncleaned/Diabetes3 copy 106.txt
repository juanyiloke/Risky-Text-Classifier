Metformin for type 1.Saw my consultant today. He is amazing. He said he can see that I've been trying very hard to control my sugars, but that I also have huge variation in sugar levels, especially as the day wears on. My nighttime is perfect. He wants me to try Metformin. He said that the reasoning for them not giving metformin to type ones seems rediculous to him. Metformin increasing insulin sensitivity, and he feels that my problems come from a slight resistance to the insulin I'm injecting. He wants me to try for a month on these, and then next month we can start to look at the pump. I got a little bit emotional at one point when I thought he was going to tell me I couldn't have the pump. But he's still very keen for me to have it. He just wants me to have the best possible chance when I start the pump. Anyway, have any of heard of metformin for type ones? It's nice to have someone say 'yes, I can see you struggle with control' rather than 'you just need to try harder' which is what I usually get.
