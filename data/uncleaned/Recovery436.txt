  I fixed everything.I didn't have friends, love,sex . Spend 4 years in prison. Had debt of 9000 for the state damages I caused. Was poor and disoriented.Now I have lots of good friends, girlfriend and lots of sex. I left cops be and they let me be. I took a loan from a bank and I slowly pay up the debt.I have my awesome collection  of books, movies, films. Cool new apartment which I made look exactly how I want. The summer is approaching and I spend a lot of time on nature absorbing  sunlight and I learned to cook good food which made me healthy as hell and by doing prison exercises I become more fit  then I ever was.And I have a plan for my awesome future life .I never went to psychiatrist(I don't trust em and I never will so I never talk to them) and I never took medication(don't want to affect my brain with outside substances. I never drink, smoked or did drugs).So if I can do it so can you.
