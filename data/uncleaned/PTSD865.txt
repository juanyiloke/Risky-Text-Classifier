Êa traumatic event seems to have had an impactIn november, i left an emotionally abusive man. He took my son and kept him for a few days. During this time, i was verbally abused and harrassed and repeatedly told i would never see my son again.ÊSince he had PR, there was nothing anyone could do to get my son back.ÊI couldnt sleep, eat or function properly. It was a very, very difficult time for me.ÊSince that time,i have shut down on an emotional level.ÊI had nightmares.consistently for a few months about my son being taken.ÊI would have flashbacks of it all happening. I would be tormented by reminders of my nightmares.ÊThankfully these have settled. I have noticed that i cant talk about the time he took my son. It makes me very emotional (yet nothing else does. Even things you would expect), and so i stay away. Even reading the things i wrote at the time make me break down.ÊDo i need to let myself go there again and relive that event, in order to open up emotionally again?ÊI did get my son back after 3 days. Which doesnt seem long, but felt like forever to me.Therapists and the likes.are telling me ive become desensitised as ive had so much trauma.ÊIs this a form of ptsd?
