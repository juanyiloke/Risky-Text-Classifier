I was sitting in the break room at work today, drinking a coke and a women soldier walks in. She had her back to me as she washed a cup or a glass in the sink. I was sitting there trying to act normal when she started singing.Now even before I got sick I've had a slight problem when people start singing near me. I'll explain. I know it sounds odd. But people sing near me! I don't mean when you're with friends and you sing a tune you like.The first time it happened I was 19 and working at a gas station. My boss was out helping me pump gas and he started singing nervously. I thought I was making him nervous and that's why he was singing. Buy it freaked me out and it made me nervous for real. I guess I thought I was driving him crazy.Anyway it happens to me occasionally and until today I thought people sang near me because I was acting crazy somehow and they were nervous and that by singing they were trying to show me how crazy I was. I seriously thought this. So the women today is singing away and I started freaking out. I thought, "Am I acting crazy"? "Does she know I have schizophrenia"? "Is this her way of getting back at me"? This went on for a full minute.BUT..........!!!! I gave up. She knows!! (I was thinking) So when she turned around I gave her a weird look. And she says, " Oh, excuse the singing. It's just such a nice day today".I had nothing to do with me!!ÊA 35 year old problem was solved in 60 seconds.The minutia of schizophrenia.P.S. Don't get me started on people coughing, lol.
