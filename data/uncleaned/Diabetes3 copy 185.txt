My Darling DiabetesMy darling diabetes, don’t you dare deceive me dear!When first we met you promised me you’d leave within a year.But now I fear you’re clinging on, and may refuse to go,And if you should, then that’s not good, and would distress me so!You promised me that, from the start, we’d be the best of friends,We’d share each day, at work and play, until the friendship ends.And when I asked you when you thought that day may one day be,You said next year, on Valentine’s – you did! You promised me!So now, be gone! Get out of here! You’re far too hard to please!You said that you would fit right in, we’d both get on with ease!But I have had to think of you and always put you first,How can you be best friends with me, when you are quite the worst?I’ve shut the doors and changed the locks, the music’s turned up loud,And I won’t hear you if you knock, so please don’t come around.My goodness, it feels wonderful now you have finally gone!Oh! I dreamt it? Ah well…I guess that life goes on…
