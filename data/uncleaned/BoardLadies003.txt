Ridiculous lie to a guy I like? Help?I made a stupid mistake! I'm 18 and I am repeating 5th year as I missed the majority of the year due to an eating disorder. I am for some reason very embarrassed about being in 5th year. All my friends are in 6th year and whenever I tell somebody that I'm in 5th year they ask why and that is not something I am ready to discuss.I met this guy who is older than me. We were texting and he asked if I was in college and I told him no I still have to do my leaving( technically not a lie). I didn't think I liked him at this stage so I didn't really care about telling an untruth anyway. He asked me out and I didn't want to go (because I couldn't really remember him and I was also nervous as he's only the second guy I've met since starting recovery.) but my friend convinced me. Turns out I had a great time, we spent 7 hours together, I actually like him! But on the way home he started asking about the leaving and everything. I panicked and just went along with the lie instead of confessing!Now I realise this was so stupid. I could've just told him that I am actually repeating because I was ill and didn't want to talk about it. I feel so stupid and like I can never see him again.ÊMy only options are to either not tell him and just not see him anymore or to tell him and hope that he understands even though I feel like telling him will actually just result in me not seeing him again AND being totally humiliated!Does anybody have advice on what I should do? Am I overreacting? I'm just furious at myself and at a total loss as to what I should do?
