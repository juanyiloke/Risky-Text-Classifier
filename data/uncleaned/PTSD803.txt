ÊPanic due to re-emerging trauma memories.I am feeling panicky and afraid,I am having trauma memories emerge.The problem is it feels like a past trauma is happening now and I feel frightened, alone and unsupported and like everything will come crashing round around me and I'll be unable to look after myself.It happened before that my house got cluttered,the garden overgrown and there was only me or my sister to do it, only my sister was also abusive and wanted me dead.I cut her out my life last October and I have been doing all the chores, and de-clutttering and keeping the garden sorted.Only it gets overwhelming especially if on one particular day I overdo it and get overtired.Today is one of those days.Although I can see the house is organized,tidy and I can live in it,ok it needs redecorating cos that is shabby and the garden is tidy and looking ok,with a bit more work it will be lovely,I can see that now, I was working on the garden today.But at times I am overtired it feels like everything is a mess again and is going to fall down around me and become unmanageable.The memory of that happening before fills my head and my sister arranging it so I have no help and arguments to drive me to suicide,and I see stuff needs doing and want to do it all at once, and I feel unless I do everything now and get it perfect I won't cope.Not coping means everything gets a mess the garden gets so overgrown I can't fix it myself and can't afford to pay anyone, the house becomes unliveable like it did before and I have to abandon it and end up homeless on the streets, I did that last time and ended up throwing myself in front of a car,then they took me to hospital and helped me.I rebuilt my life after that, but I know it is crazy but I keep being afraid it is going to happen all over again.It is less likely to happen now cos my sister is gone, I refuse to let her in my life so she can't sabotage my house and mess with my head and emotions.But it feels in my mind and emotions that that traumatic experience is going to keep happening, going round in circles like it had done for years and I don't know how to stop the feelings and fear around all that.It hurts and is painful and exhausting to have the worry and anxiety of it all.I need to convince myself it is just a memory and that I am safe, I am coping with what I need to do to keep the house safe.I am getting the help for home and personal care so how is it I feel and think it will overwhelm me and get in a mess like it did four years ago and again last October.Four years ago my sister almost killed me,she then said sorry pleaded with me to let her back into my life, behaved herself for three and half years,pretending to love me, cos she knew I'd dump her if she became verbally violent again,then started turning nasty and reverting to type for six months so I cut her out last October when she was up to her old tricks sabotaging stuff in my house and going on about my will and she tried again to drive me to suicide.It is the trauma of all that gets mixed up with the here and now makes me anxious and panicky.I have just started mindfulness,trying to empty my mind and find peace.Anyone got any other suggestions and advice for dealing with trauma memories and my particular situation?Thanks for reading.Nikitax
