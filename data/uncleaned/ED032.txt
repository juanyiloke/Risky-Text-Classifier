A bit of help for a rough dayHello,Today is a rough day on the food front, and for the sake of some peace of mind I have a few questions for the forum:1) Is there anyone who has made a complete recovery from an ED? Who has come out the other side? The human body and mind are amazing and capable of so many things so I'm sure it is possible, but some days it hangs on me so heavy I doubt I will ever be rid of it. Some days I feel it covers me completely and all the things I love about myself disappear completely into the the thick cloud of food obsession. I have a very supportive boyfriend and family but sometimes I get so lost in my own mind I can't find a way out. Any Advice??2) I really think group therapy would benefit me, but I am an American living in The Netherlands. Does anyone know anything about support groups overseas? I don't even know where to begin to look so any information would be helpful.3) I feel the ED is the most intense when I haven't slept enough. To be honest it makes me want to consume everything in sight. Does this happen to anyone else? Of course I always try to sleep enough to avoid it, but sometimes for whatever reason 8 hours of sleep isn't possible (traveling, working, studying ext...) This is life. Does anyone have any coping tips they find helpful for this?Thank you
