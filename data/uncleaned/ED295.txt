ÊAnti-psychotics and weight lossHi everyone,I'm a former anorexic but in the last two years I've also been diagnosed with psychotic depression and put on anti-psychotics (Depixol, then Piportil, now aripiprazole). This has caused a weight gain, which is obviously very distressful to me as it puts me at the high end of a healthy BMI.ÊBefore I was anorexic I was underweight anyway, so didn't have to lose much to become very ill. What I want to know is if anyone has any experience of losing large amounts of weight, and how it affects you. I'm a bit scared of heart problems. But unfortunately my will to lose weight overrides this.
