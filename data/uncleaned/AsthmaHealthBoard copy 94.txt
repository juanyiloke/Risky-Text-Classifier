  Ugh, please tell me it's not asthma...________________________________________Hi everyone, I recently moved to Japan last October for a job and am located in a mountainous area. It has been starting to warm up and we had a mild winter with only a few days of snow. Anyway, I had a bad cold in December when I returned back to the States for Christmas. Then it returned a bit (not as bad) when I was back here in January. It went away by the end of January and I've had a very mild, intermittent cough. Recently in February, I had a mild wheeze infrequently in the morning and at night. Finally, this week I had a really bad wheeze on Tuesday (5:30 PM) and this Saturday morning (4:30 AM). So far, I haven't noticed any trouble breathing (except for panicky breathing)On Tuesday, I went to the doctor around 5:30 PM. By the time, I got to see him (6:30 PM) the wheezing had gone down almost to be unnoticeable. The doc prescribed me Symbicort and I've only taken it on Tuesday and this Saturday morning during the wheezing episodes. The bad wheezing spells so far are always preempted by dryish coughs that I can't stop. I had asthma or some bronchitis for a really short period in middle school where I didn't really use the prescribed inhaler that much. I think I also have a dust allergy and my house is pretty dusty. Lastly, I have only had these wheezing spells in my house so far...Sorry for the long post but I'm scared to go to sleep and to exercise now. I'm also scared about how it will affect my job as I'm in front of people most of the day. Could it really be asthma?
