I just created an account so I hope i'm doing this correctly. Anyway, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia one and a half years ago, after going to psychiatrists for several years. Actually, when I was 18 years old (I'm almost 26 now) , I met a doctor who was filling in for my usual doctor while he was on summer vacation and he suspected I was developing schizophrenia so he put me on antipsychotics and I've been on them since then. But here comes the question I'm wondering if I will get any answers to. Since I've been on meds since really early, I think I haven't been as psychotic as I would have been without the meds. Can anyone relate? Does anyone else ever get painfully curious about what would happen if they stopped taking the drugs?
