A friendly faceHello, I wondered whether there is any scope on the forum for members to be able to get in touch with others who live in the same area. Please forgive my ignorance if this already happens! I'm on palliative chemotherapy and would love to have someone to meet up with now and again who knows what I'm going through. I'm lucky in that I have lovely supportive friends and family who visit/take me out/i drive them when I feel ok, but everyone I know apart from the parents, works or has young children, so it's not always convenient. Like everyone I have down days but most of the time try to stay positive. I get so bored sometimes and would love to go out more for days but perhaps with someone/others who know what it's really like.
