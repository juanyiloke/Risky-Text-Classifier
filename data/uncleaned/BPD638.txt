I Have Borderline Personality DisorderI'm at a weekend away with a club I'm part of, and someone when they were drunk said "No one likes you Amber, you should just leave." I know that if I think about this logically, he was drunk, and we have spoken about it and he said he didn't mean it. But the thing is, I already believe that about myself, and for someone to say it to me outright, that just confirms it for me. I've never felt more alone even though I'm surrounded by people. This weekend away was meant to be fun, but all it did was put me in a really bad place, make me feel like I don't fit anywhere and just made me feel like I have nobody. Why do people suck so much?
