People who know the source of their PTSD. My journey into the weird and wonderful world of PTSD symptoms began 10 years ago. At first I just ignored it, a random collection of images that meant absolutely zippo to me. But of course it didn't stop there and now when I read the list of signs/symptoms etc I can relate to everyone of them. I'm slowly putting together the picture of my trauma (from early childhood) but I still don't relate to it at all. Sometimes it's like I've crawled inside somebody else's brain. Now I am starting to get 'body' memories in my legs which scare me to death. And I just can't cope with it. The NHS have been useless and have just made me worse. Where on earth are these people trained....Planet Zod??? I just want it all to stop. Some days I just want to run and run and run and maybe if I run fast enough and far enough I can leave all of this behind. As each day, week, month passes I'm getting worse. I'm unemployed now and facing financial ruin. This PTSD has slowly robbed me of everything in my life and it isn't finished with me yet. Can I turn things around? I doubt it. I wish for the sake of others reading this that I can find something positive to say, but I can't, it's been down hill and very bumpy all the way and now I'm just waiting for the big crash.
