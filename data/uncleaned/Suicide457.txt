Right nowCrystalRight now Im lost. Im confused and scared and tired. Ive been depressed for a number of years now and Im ready to let go. As i Sit here next to a pack of blades, I worry, who will find me? Its my main concern. Will it be my 13 year old, or my daughter whos 5. Will they care then? Will they not treat me so badly anymore? I admit, my additude sucks at times, but its cause Im so tired of feeling this way. Just wanting my man to touch me, to love me, to hold me as I tried to understand why I was feeling like this. to have my my kids appreciate all the long days and nights ive put into my business, i do it all for them. So they can have a roof over their head and food in their bellies. I sacrafice my own happiness for others, and its gotten me here….next to this pile of razors. Ready to say goodbye….
