DietHi allI was diagnosed with bowel cancer and liver mets a month or so ago. I'm relatively young and there is no history of bowel cancer in my family, so I've assumed the cause is somehow linked to my diet. As a result, I've asked my oncologist and several of my nurses what sort of things I should be eating now, but have just been told to maintain a balanced, healthy diet. Even red meat isn't out of the equation which surprised me.This contradicts some of the posts on this forum so now I'm not sure what I should be eating. I must confess to being a little of a fussy eater, salads do not interest me one bit. I'm currently undergoing chemo and as yet I haven't noticed any impact on my tastes, but this may come I suppose.Does anyone have any thoughts?Thanks
