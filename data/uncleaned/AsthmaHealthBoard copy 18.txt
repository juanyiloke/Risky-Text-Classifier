Oral thrush caused by steroid inhaler________________________________________I've had on and off oral thrush for a little over a year, and it all started when I took Symbicort steroid inhaler for the first time and neglected to rinse my mouth; I was then treated with antibiotics for it because the doctor thought it was tonsillitis.Since then I've been using beclometasone dipropionate (a brown steroid inhaler I've been using for years without trouble and without rinsing), but I still have reoccurring bouts of thrush despite now rinsing after using it (I use one puff two times a day). Basically, I'm wondering the best way to prevent oral thrush or any options that could aid me in keeping it away as it seems that rinsing and Yakult aren't enough
