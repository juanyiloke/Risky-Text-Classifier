 Suggestions on how to murder housemate?by InazumaP.s. title not *too* serious.p.p.s. this is a rantAside from being an idiot resitting first year, a liar half the time, and a cheap druggie waste; I swear I'm going crazy.So aside from constantly being filthy, literally dragging me out of my room to 'socialise' with them, never paying bills or loans back to housemates on time and having begged lifts for most of first term (he doesn't get any anymore) he has the worst habit of stealing food.He ate my lunch the other day claiming 'it was out and it had been there for over 2 days' (it could only have been misplaced for <12 hours.So as revenge I spiked his crappy pate and hid the rest. He got annoyed, ended up hurting me to make me tell him where they were (even though he always steals our food.)Then today I find he took my bread out of the freezer claiming it took too much space (now the freezer has tons of space, and he just filled half the fridge with his crappy vegetables too), put it into his cupboard and then ate half of it.I swear I am so bored of his crap, and no matter what I say he never apologises, never changes. I can't even get revenge because I'm worried he'll keep being an ass or hurt me. My housemates who all knew him better have tried to do things like force him to pay back and replace things on threat of various things. He'll probably fail again which will be bloody hilarious and I'm not living with him next year but aghhhh I'm just so sick of it especially right before exams. >So to make this um rant into a thread - advice / share stories of utter ****s?
