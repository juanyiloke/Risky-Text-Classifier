Are you expected to help out your parents after your studies? (Pgs: 1 2)by meaow1990There is no 'post-university' forum so I'm posting it here.Do your parents expect you to help them out/send them money (when you've got a good job of course)My parents come from SE Asia and they wanted me to have a good education. Ideally they saw me studying a STEM subject, something that is vocational, makes money, and helps them out. But I didn't submit to their wishes- I valued my independence and individuality and studied what I was interested in (in arts). They couldn't understand that; perhaps it is 'selfish'.But sometimes, as graduation is looming and I see dire job prospects for arts graduates, I feel a bit guilty - my parents work really hard in 'dead-end' jobs, always told me how important education is, hardly allow themselves to have fun, hobbies, I'm the first one to go to university, and sometimes they send me money which I accept with guilt as it's towards my own 'self-indulging' studies while they work of their socks. I have to say, they work and live in Europe - so it's a bit different than if they were in a poor country with no pensions.But then again, I'm a bit sad that I probably will never make enough money to send some back to my parents so they can perhaps work less hours or have some fun. I realize though it's their life and what they make out of it but I think the 'gap' is just so different. I was born and quickly learned Western values whereas my parents don't understand of studying a subject (and paying for it) that you 'like'. I could see myself as a teacher, I love teaching, and my parents don't see it as too bad but I know I wouldn't earn enough to help them.I couldn't phrase a better thread title...
