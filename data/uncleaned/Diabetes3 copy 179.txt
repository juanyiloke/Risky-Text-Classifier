What's going on now?Well Patty is causing me some grief this week   I seem to be having some random choppy blood sugar and I'm wondering if it's this stinking cold? Basically I'm getting quite significant two hour post meal peaks where I would normally stay relatively stable, and then dropping quickly to mild hypo level by the next meal. So today after brekkie I was 8.5 but then before lunch 3.7, 9 two hours after lunch and then 3.7 before dinner. It's been like this since the cold started but seems to be reaching a peak. Am I right in assuming that the cold has increased my insulin resistance (I'm classified as extremely sensitive normally) so my food is peaking before the insulin? I suspect Patty is also getting her emergency flag out when it's peaking and offering a squirt or two of juice to help which is causing the slight hypos. Does that sound feasible? Just checking that I'm not in need of yet more basal testing...for the fiftieth time since diagnosis  Also had a week of nightime hypos, which is just lovely when a good sleep would be rather nice
