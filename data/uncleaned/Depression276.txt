ÊVery low energy Êbangalore,Ê4  My energy levels are often low. It can be very frustrating too be low on energy most of the time. I find it helpful to keep pushing through otherwise I would just isolate myself. I am not on any medication and I have found exercise helpful in the past. I am walking a bit at the moment and I will start swimming again soon. Socialising and exercising have been the two things that do help a lot. I try not to let my mood dictate how I live. I have been low today and I have not let this stop me from doing the things i needed or wanted to do.ÊPushing Through Êbangalore,Ê2  Sometimes it is not always health or possible to keep pushing oneself and just ignore the depression and anxiety that is their.ÊI do find it helps me to not let my mood or mental state dictate what I do. I find socialising and exercise essential for bringing more peace of mind. Walking, cycling and swimming really help me a lot. I find swimming good and I feel very calm after a swim.ÊThese things help me to feel better in myself. For me it is about when I can push through and when it totally overwhelms me. I have learnt by going to things like social events it always works out ok and that I can always leave if I need to.
