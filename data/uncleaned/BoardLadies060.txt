SAD LampsI was thinking of getting a SAD lamp for my significant other, when I noticed quite a few of you said on the Xmas wishlist thread that you already have them and love them.I had no idea they were so popular, I dont know why but for some reason I thought it was something the average person would never have heard of it.So I thought maybe start a thread on it maybe get some ideas going back and forward, maybe see what lamps other people are using etc..
