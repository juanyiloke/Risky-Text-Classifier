ÊTrauma at Supermarket today!My nerves were shot and I was in bits, real, vulnerable afraid.Fireworks and Halloween stuff on the shopping shelves and lots of it,mean and nasty and who am I a fucking ghost and fucking furry plastic crows the size of fucking owls and some creep is lovingly mouthing Harry Potter at me.I am having traumas reemerging and trying to get two weeks shopping and very unnerved by the things I'd forgotten from the past catching me unawares and the shopping list, if I forget something bloody important it will cost taxi money to go back.Come home, terrified of getting the wrong taxi driverand home feels unsafe.I ring Crisis ask them to talk, I am scared, she talks a bit says I have to speak to the duty worker, gets all admin, realize won't get an instant love reaction to immediately lift the pain, back in real world I don't know anyone well enough yet and noone knows me to elicit a loving response from. Crisis,it is a bloody office, but that in itself re-orientated me.All that and so much fear and my fucking sister and my mother are in my head talking, their messages giving me directions and responses to my every move.Angry,I am, my sister is in my head, I won't get rid of her, I need the things she said that were strong and protecting, at one time in my life she must have been cos the words are in my mind in a tone of clear love and they help and support, so I can do it without her,how did she change from that loving person to the fascist she is now.But she is not warm and protecting like that real voice of her's, in real life today, she is a murderer,wants me dead.Part of her spirit must come from heaven and part from hell.I thought in the end, the worst thing could happen,I will go mad and breakdown in public or in my house and end up in the Mental health hospital, play that game, I know it inside out, but then the game changes doesn't it.Still from the sounds of the people at Crisis, I'll be in there get out and be no danger to myself or the world again.Remind me did I sign up for this, pre-incarnation whilst in heaven!Another consideration would anyone love me and the answer is no judging by the state of me in the mirror today the horrible fillings in my mouth,why does the dentist cost so much,and the fact I need a stick and can barely walk at times.The cat medicine went up inbetween them ordering it and it coming in, £123.Wow!Ouch!Inside I feel 24 years old still and I am 50,do I let my head go white or not.Am I right to get angry about the women in the world whose most worrying problem is about fashion, hair and make-up.Back to the world of the mundane.Christ,help me!At least home feels safe again now,just need to shut the world out and tell myself I've lived here 20 years and I am not dead yet.
