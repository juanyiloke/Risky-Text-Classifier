New Hereby twisted phoenix » Fri May 29, 2015 2:10 pmHi all,I've just joined the site today. I'm female, from the UK, and was diagnosed unofficially with Borderline PD earlier this year.I'd really like to get to know other people who have this issue, as at the moment I feel like no one gets where I'm coming from emotionally.I have a fiance, he has his own MH issues, so he's more tolerant of my ways, but at times I wonder if I'm making him ill just by being myself. And that brings on the crippling guilt for me, which then makes me push him away before he realises he's wasted so much time on this scrap of skin he calls his girlfriend! Anyway, I just wanted to say hello to everyone, hope you're all having a good day
