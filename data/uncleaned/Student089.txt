Attending university socials whilst not a studentby shoutingI don't go to university. After my A-Levels, I was offered a job in London and quit that after a year to start my own business. Had I gone to uni I would now be in my second year. Everyone I know in London I know through work or business, and they are pretty much all at least ~5 years older than I am. My younger friends from home are spread across the country on their own university courses, so I quite rarely get to see them.I'd like to start spending more time with people my own age. It seems that most generic strangers-meeting-for-social-stuff events/meetups in London are aimed towards older people (late 20s and 30s or so). I thought I could try is attempting to sneakily integrate myself into a university society (maybe an LGBTQ one? They sound fun). So:- Is this a thing? Do these sorts of groups allow random folk to just message and then turn up?- London people: can you recommend anything for me or otherwise point me in the right direction?Thanks!
