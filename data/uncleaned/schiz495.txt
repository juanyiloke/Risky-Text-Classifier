ÊFeeling myself slipping backwards again Voices have returnedAfter a good few months of being quite stable my voices have returned again. For the past 3 months all i was getting was jibberish and none coherent sounds but now I am having my evil voice telling me that I am evil and I must distroy those around me. I am strong enough to cope with this voice as I have good insight with my illness but I am worried because I have tried Qutiapine,chlorpromazine,Abilify,clopixol,depixol and risperidone. I can't have a go with clozapine because I have a low white blood count. I fear that no treatment is going to work I am quite scared that I am going to loose my insight.ÊWhen I am constantly being told that I am evill and that my wife hates me it is hard to see reason. I am seeing my CPN on wednesday and I will ask her to speak to the doctor again and hopefully they can come up with a plan of action.ÊAny advice would be really great.
