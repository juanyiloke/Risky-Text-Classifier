Eating Disorded MentalityHi all,I am a 36 year old male, and have suffered with an eating disorder since i was 16.  When it first hit i was terrified of food, being thin was all that mattered, so simply not eating seemed the obvious thing to do.  As the years passed, with long term visits to therapy i thought i was more or less dealing with things well.  I still at times had bizarre rituals around what food seemed safe, places, utensils etc - but i thought i had come to terms with it.  Yet here i am again, a nervous breakdown at the start of this year.  At therapy my therapist concentrates a lot on the mentality and disordered thinking of my eating disorder.  I do eat, and probably eat ok - the rules are still there, but presently they dont distress me too much.  I wanted to ask others about how they moved on, and is it possible?  I feel my long term depression and anxiety just is never ending - food always plays a big part - but at the same time i never have blamed food for the continuation of my problems, to me it seems more of a symptom.  My therapist tells me i have low self esteem, black and white thinking etc - she says all the traits of someone with an ED.  How then can food at times seem to not be so troublesome, but the traits persist and make things so hard to deal with?!
