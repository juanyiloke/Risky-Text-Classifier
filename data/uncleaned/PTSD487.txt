 WitchCraft?My T wants to start emdr for a recent trauma I suffered. She also wants to start neuro biofeedback to look at my brainwaves & learning to control them. I have this overwhelming feeling first to laugh in her face bec I don't believe in any of this & feel like it's hog wash. I also have this feeling that I'm wasting my time. Don't I have to believe in this stuff for it to really work?I have such a negative attitude toward these different theories. Their not magic & that's what I'd love to find What should I be expecting?How can I open myself up to believe this?Should I bother?Thanks
