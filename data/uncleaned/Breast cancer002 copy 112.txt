TUG free flap breast reconstruction¥	Hi. I had a bilateral mastectomy in August but was told to wait 6 months before considering reconstruction. I am now disappointed to learn that implants are not suitable for me because I am too thin. Apparently the outline would show not to mention any creasing or rippling. My only option now is the TUG method - taking fat and muscle from the inner thigh. Has anyone any experiences to share of this procedure? I had been so looking forward to my new boobs but now I'm not sure if it will all be worth it as I am actually managing quite well with just my softies and padded bras. I am 49 and miss my boobs but don't want to go through a major operation and lengthy recovery unless the results are really good. I would be grateful for any comments, thank you.
