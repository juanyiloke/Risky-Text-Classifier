ÊHallucinations are getting worse and I feel terrified and hopelessHi, I'm new. This is my first post.. I'd really appreciate some help though?I don't know what is wrong with me. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for two years now but I just got a new one and I'm not sure I can tell her everything because of my severe anxiety. For as long as I remember, I have been experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. When I was younger, I thought everyone experienced hallucinations. But, as the years went by, they steadily became worse and worse. My visual hallucinations aren't nearly as bad as the auditory (I see shadows running in front of me, bugs crawling on walls and sometimes on my skin, and flashing lights as well as seeing more than one of things that are AND aren't there, though my vision is 20/20) but I'm still very scared. The voices continually tell me to harm and kill myself and the only way to shut them up for just a short time is to self harm (something I've struggled with for years). Among the voices, I hear other sounds as well. I hear unintelligible whispers, beeping, sounds of people and animals running towards and away from me, as well as clicks, taps, and other various sounds that aren't heard by other people. I don't know if this is relevant but I am also diagnosed with OCD. Sorry about so much, but I just need advice. Badly. Thank you. Has anyone else dealt with this? I just feel so alone..Ê
