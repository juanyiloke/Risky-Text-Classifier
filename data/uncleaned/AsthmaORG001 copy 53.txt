Churg Strauss syndrome - anyone been diagnosed? I have recently been diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma.have had three hospital admissions and, three weeks ventilated in ITU . I have now developed urticaria, high blood pressure and have complex asthma management medication regime. My consultant has mentioned C S S and I wondered if there was anyone out there who has been diagnosed? I'm currently struggling with a cycle of being really well, a mild chest infection needing antibiotics and steroids, and then a longer period of severe breathlessness needing home nebulisers and high dose steroids. I want to get this thing under control!
