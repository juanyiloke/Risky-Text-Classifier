What's wrongI'm 16 I've been anarexic for almost a year because Ive always saw myself fat when I was actually a decent weight for my age. In the first four months when this began I lost a little over 20 pounds then my family started to notice so my mom gave me my servings at breakfest and dinner and made sure I ate it all I've been gaining more weight now by eating all the right foods and yet I still look super skinny to my friends even sometimes me but I still see my self not skinny enough. But I guess my question is how do I still look skinny when I'm gaining my weight back
