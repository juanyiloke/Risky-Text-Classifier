Diabetes check up reviewHba1c........6.3% in old money, it's been between 6 and 6.4 for past 4 years.Cholesterol..5. as I stopped taking Pravastatin 4 years ago ,they are happy with that number, its been between 4.9 and 5 in last 4 years.Blood pressure...130/70. the are of course happy with that.Kidney function improved from 50% to 70%They said they were impressed with the way I have taken control of my diabetes and also how I maintain that and still push for answers to questions.I told them that having not been offered any structured training by them, I had to find my own, and I went on to tell them about our forum. They have now asked me for details and they will publish it in the monthly practice news letter.Overall one of my best reviews in 10 years.JohnAlmost-Hypos with very little insulinFollowing a challenge both from a consultant and a GP regarding hypo frequency, I've been experimenting for a few weeks now with drastically reduced Bolus having been Basal free for about three months.I'm now typically Bolusing 1-3 units of Novorapid before breakfast and then nothing before lunch or dinner and generally having no further Novorapid through the day or just 1-2 units correction if I spike to or above 9 post meal.Over the last week I've begun to experience BG's in the very low 4's in the mid to late afternoon or evening. As my morning Bolus is at around 05:15 and most references say Novorapid should no longer be active after a few hours, am I safe in assuming that my low results later in the day mean that my pancreas is achieving non-diabetic levels for me or are there other possible causes that I should consider.In 4 months I've now gone from a daily total of around 40 units of Levemir + Novorapid to 1-4 units of Novorapid and am getting a little confused as to whether I should consider coming off insulin all together.Any thought as always much appreciated.ThanksJohn
