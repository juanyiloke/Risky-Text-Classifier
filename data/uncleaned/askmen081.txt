Managers, I need your opinion2012-09-05, 09:32 AMThis problem is actually not happening to me, it's happening to my manager. Management made him responsible to " clean up a mess" that happened when he wasn't even in his position. I will say that my company is associated with the government and now this project is ultimately making him look bad because he is being investigated. My manager is smart, competetent and incredibly hard working. I do not want anything to happen to him. It seems like he is being set up for failure. Is there anything I can do? The company appears to be railroading him so to speak.
