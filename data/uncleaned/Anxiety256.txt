Handling my anxiety better.....ButMy reaction to things that do cause me stress, rather than an anxiety attack or just plain anxiety/nervousness are starting to manifest as ANGER. I use caps because I am usually very low key and have the patients of Job...which is often commented on and considered a plus for my job duties. Example: I just got call from parents, they are going to hospital, my Grandmother age 90 has been admitted for testing, she has been sick and not getting any better. She's 90 and these things happen but for some reason my response was anger off the chart, I had to control myself not to take it out on a co worker, who was helping me with a project...right now I feel like my head is going to explode, BP must be off the charts. There is no reason for this reaction, completely uncalled for..but unable to channel feelings other than anger at the moment. Maybe feel helpless...not sure..there is nothing I can do or need to do.Finally taking control of nightmaresI have suffered forever with nightmares...kid to present...broken lamps while fighting in my sleep, even blackened an eye once when I ran into a door fighting a "large Cat". funny now. I have started listening to music I enjoy and makes me happy just before I go to sleep, and have managed to change a bad dream to good. Example last night I was in a house with other people and something was trying to get us, we were barricading ourselves in house...somehow I flipped it around to a party were a woman I know and secretly have a thing for( thats not going anywhere she's married, I don't date married women, keeps ya from getting shot) showed up, apparently unmarried in my dream..we had a great time at party and being a couple. I call it a step in right direction.
