BPH or ProstatitisHi,Firstly let me stress - I'm not looking for medical advice - I get that for 50 euro from my doctor.To all the men out there who read the Gentlemen Forum. Im curios Has anyone been diagnosed with this? How has it affected you? affected your partner?Im "youngish" was diagnosed with this last week, I was told Id be on the tablets for the rest of my life (no problem here), however the side effects are to my mind horrendous.Overall is the internet better or worse for society?A recent thread about Facebook being an overhyped tabloid newspaper got me thinking.Do you think the internet has had (or will have in years to come) more advantages or disadvantages?Obviously with social networks, emails and Skype you could say it has more advantages as regards keeping in touch with friends and family, but would phone calls and post mail been as successful if they continued (to the level the internet currently provides) to this day?I've also heard a rumour all newspapers will be digitized in years to come and will only be available online. Is this better or worse? I know for example I'd rather pay for printed media than electronic, but some might feel different.Also I like weekly trips to Tesco's. Will there be a point online shopping will replace this completely? If it does will other people miss the experience?And apparently there's a new dating app people can use in clubs to sift through those who are interested and those who are not? Looking at that just makes me think how many aspects of our lives can be turned into a cyber commodity?Discuss.
