But when i found out a weighed as less as that i got a grip and pulled myself out now i am 6 stone 6 and feeling fantastic ive been eating everything i would not have eating at the time of anorexic things like chocolate but i still dont eat fryed foods but that will come back as well ive been eating loads i just wont to get better now but to all the girls out there dying to be anorexic please take my advice and dont become. It is an illness that is extreamly hard to get out of it is an addiction.
