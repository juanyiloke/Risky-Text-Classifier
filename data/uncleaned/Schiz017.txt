If so, what are the causes?What have you done to cope with this disorder? (Therapy, Medication- If so, what kind?) What seemed to work best if anything at all?What is the worst hardship that you have faced from your disease?Before you were diagnosed, how long was it before you knew there was a problem? How has your disorder affected the people in your life?thanks. i'd really appreciate if anyone could help me out
