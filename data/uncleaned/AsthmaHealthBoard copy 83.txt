Looking for help________________________________________I was diagnosed with Occupational Asthma, Have had numerous allergy test, blood test and a lung biopsy over the past 2 1/2 years. I stay out of the sawmill and dusty, smoky situations. Pretty much spend my time managing from my desk, not my strong suit  . I can tell when its going to get bad, first my head and sinuses plug up and within a couple of days my breathing goes straight down the tubes. Then it takes about a week of Prednisone and Antibiotics before I start to straighten up. Two years ago I was running 5K's with my wife now on a good day I can make maybe a 1/2 mile. Anybody been down this road?thanks,
