We are:A text only service for suicidal people who need a friend.Free (except if your cell phone carrier charges for texts)We accept texts from anyone, any age, gender, race, religion, or location.Sometimes you just feel lonely and don't feel like anyone understands you or maybe you don't have anyone available at all. You can be anonymous and in a day and age where young people prefer to text, maybe due to some insecurities, we accommodate that.ÊWe can talk about anything. Pretend it's your best friend you're texting and know you're never being judged and that we've been through the same thing that you have. We aren't your parents or here to lecture you or read you one-liners from a sheet of paper. We can offer advice or lend a shoulder or an ear. (We'll never text you if you tell us to stop.) You're never alone!Look forward to talking :)SuicidexSide
