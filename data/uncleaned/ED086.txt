Insurance and MedicationI have been having the most difficult time with my insurance covering any part of my prescription medications. These medications are for my eating disorder and other mental health disorders. I am at the point right now where I cannot afford anymore. But if I stop taking my meds I'm bound to fall back down. If I fall back down, it could be life or death. I cannot afford to do that. I am at a loss and have no idea what to do right now. It's all messed up with my insurance companies and I cannot do anything about it. I had a state plan, which I tried to terminate but they haven't terminated. So my new plan won't take effecct until that is cancelled. THe state plan tells me I have to cancel it with Carefirst and Carefirst tells me I have to cancel it with them. I have spent 1 1/2 months working on this and I h$500/month, plus all my therapy, psychiatry, and nutritional appoinotments. I can't afford this anymore. I'm about to just give up. This is all too much.
