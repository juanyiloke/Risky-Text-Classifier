Fizzy drinksToday is a happy day for me as I cannot abide diet drinks and have a friend who is always saying I should have diet drinks as they are better for your health so am I happy this has been proved not to be the case and diet drinks may actually do more damage to your health not that I would stop drinking my Tango Cherry (I don't drink tea or coffee) but I can do it now without feeling guilty while you have your half a glass of beer     Also the stick thin people who have always made this mature lady feel envious are more likely to suffer health problems in later years so no worry about dieting either     Great day for 'normal' people
