Fiancé and I disagree if I should have an attorney2013-04-13, 04:56 PMShe says stick with the attorney. I am thinking it might be counterproductive. Let me explain. I was diagnosed with acute stress reaction back in February by my doctor. I went on medical leave through mid March. The company, long story short, is not covered under FMLA. When mid March rolled around, I told my company my doctor recommended an extension. When I asked the Company for an extension, they terminated me. They said when I'm cleared to work, I can reapply for my position and if there is a suitable position open, there is an expectation I will be hired back. As soon as I as let go, the company advertised my position. So I i found a lawyer, she and I are very optimistic the company did an unlawful termination. Here is my question. My position as of right now is open. I have been cleared to work with accommadation. My lawyer thinks he accommodation is reasonable. My lawyer wants to negotiate my job back, if they refuse my request,then we sue. Since my job is still open, I think I can ask directly for my job back without a lawyer. If I bring a lawyer into this, the company will be scared. My lawyer thinks since i have been terminated, i have no leverage, especially asking for accommadation. . My fiancé thinks the lawyer is right. Just curious what others think?
