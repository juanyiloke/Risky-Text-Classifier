Hi,ÊI'm not sure if I need some help with my parenting, or I just have a challenging child at times, but I'm feeling at a loss with my son at the moment. My 9 year old son is very impulsive and has been like this since he was quite small, my younger son is a lot more placid and a lot easier to discipline and reason with. Basically my oldest son is very dominant of his younger brother, he disrupts his younger brothers games by taking things he is playing with, without asking, when I ask him to give his brother the toy back, he can take time to do this, he will push it back to him in an aggressive manner, I then explain to him that he needs to ask before he takes things, however, this happens again and again and even when I've told him how to deal with a situation he just repeats it, I read online to help children deal with conflicts together and avoid consequences, but even when I'm trying to give my son the tools to deal with certain things he just repeats them again and again, so I think I am going to have to enforce some consequences for this, he also takes things from his brother (out of his hands) and us sometimes without muttering a single word, so basically he snatches and at 9 years old, I don't think it's appropriate behaviour, even though we've explained time and time again to ask first and to use his manners. Tonight we played Trumps which he enjoys, but he ruined the game by snatching the card out of my hand and when I spoke to him about it he ran out of his room and tried pushing the door on me, from that moment I told him I didn't want to be around him when he behaved like that and left his room, I also needed to leave to calm myself down because I was feeling angry with the way he behaved. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this, to bring some calmness to our household.ÊThanks in advance!
