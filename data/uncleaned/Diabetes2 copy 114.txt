Do other people have this problem?Also I feel very well and have a lot of energy but my blood glucose is always above 12. I cannot take the tablets common for Diabetes and have been advised to try Insulin Injections. After ten years of being Diabetic is this common for the need for Insulin or are the medical teams in panic to get my blood sugar levels down.Any help and advice would be gratfully received. I am a stone over wieght but exercise by walking and cycling. My bowels are always loose and the Diabetic drugs make this worse I take codeine phosphate daily for this.
