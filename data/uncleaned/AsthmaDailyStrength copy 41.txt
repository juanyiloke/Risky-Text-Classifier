What I hate most about the spring is my allergy triggered asthma. I love being outdoors. Love boating, fishing, camping, hiking, etc. but even with taking 250/50 Advair, 50mcgFlonase, 10 mg Singulair, and 10 mg of Zyrtec, I can't spend a whole day outside without paying for it for days. I was at a May day celebration on Sunday all day (outside most of the time) and I still am congested, ribs sore trying to breathe. I am glad it is going to rain for the next few days in PA so the pollen washes out of the air and I can breath. I am off work right now for other reasons and the asthma is not helping with getting over those problems. Sick of being a prisoner to the apartment.
