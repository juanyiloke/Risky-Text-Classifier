Recent Hospital Stay - oh dear!I haven't posted for quite a while as I haven't really had anything useful or interesting to say. I do read others posts most days.However I recently had to spend just over a week in a local hospital for a suspected heart condition, and others might find my experiences (I am looking for the right word here). Shall we say "interesting". This was the first time in my life I have had to stay overnight (except perhaps when I was born!).This hospital has a very good national reputation for cardiac care including for children. There is good news and bad. I will start with the bad. I was moved around the hospital several times during my stay and it soon became obvious that about 90% of patients were diabetic. Although admittedly many were quite elderly. It also became obvious that the nurses did not have a clue about diabetes and those I came across did not even seem to know the difference between type one and type two. They used to test at random times which bore no relation to anything as far as I could tell. I expressed horror when tested at about 10:00 pm one evening and the reading was 10.7. The nurse said it was "quite satisfactory" and would "see me through the night!!!" The menu at this hospital is actually quite comprehensive. In spite of this it was impossible to avoid carbohydrate as I would normally at home and I was more than a little stressed. Heaven help us all if this is common to all hospitals. The general standard of nursing care was pretty poor but I think this was mainly through being very short of staff.The good news (maybe) is that I got the impression that the NHS (at this hospital anyway) are very quietly backing away from the cholesterol theory. Bearing in mind  that I was there for severe angina attacks, cholesterol was not mentioned once in consultations. I was never tested for it during my stay and I was never asked what it was at my last diabetic review. Let's hope.
