ÊWhispers...Getting ready for bed last night I can't shake the feeling that I heard whispering... Like a half dozen voices just whispering incoherently in the background...No radio was on in the house. No tv.ÊJust, whispering...Stranger still, I feel as if I can only remember hearing them as if from a dream.....ÊAs tho my mind is trying not to let me remember...But, I do. Distant. Surreal. Abstract...ÊSo, I sit and wonder...ÊDid I infact hear these whispers; or is my mind playing some kind of strange trick on me?Who knows ...Just thought I'd share.......
