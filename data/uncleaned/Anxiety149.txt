head shivers / kinda prickle Ê14    So I'm doing miles better and a lot of positive thinking and I feel 80% better accept now new symtoms are occurring I have had headaches for around 3 months really bad this month the worse last night was horrendous couldn't stand light was nearly sick and could barely walk I laid down on the couch and fell to sleep woke and my foot was ice cold and jelly no feeling what so ever when I put my leg on the floor I got the worse pins and needles and my leg collasped when I stood up and I fell to the ground ? this morning I awoke with the headache slightly there not pain as such can just still slightly feel it there if you know what I mean then now "new" symtoms of prickling in same side of head where the pain was and shivers in head and body kinda like cold shivers inside the body just don't want to break my positive thinking because I actually feel really better just back of my mind I have slight worry about a stroke/tumour does anybody else get shivers or head symtoms ?
