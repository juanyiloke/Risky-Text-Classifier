Fear of going to work due to anxiety/panic attacks/asthma Ê7    Hi allSorry if this is really stupid (and long winded) but since being diagnosed with panic attack disorder with agraphobia and asthma since last year, ive developed a fear about going to work and on occasions even leaving the house.Last year I was signed off for nearly 6 months because of how bad I was and when I returned I did a phase return for 6 weeks before being signed for for work full time. However since January ive hardly been to work, using every excuse I can in order for me to work from home (which I have a sick certificate for from the doctors).I'm due back at work today (last time I was in the office was end of March) and I'm so scared.The things I'm scared of are:Travelling to and from work - at the moment I pay for cabs as im scared to use public transport by myselfWork environment - as ive been off for so long, I feel individuals at work judge me and I feel uneasy. Plus at work, I feel jittery and scared about all the things the working day ahead has in store for me I.e I'm scared about lunchtime and having to go out to get my lunch, I'm then scared about eating my lunch alone etcWork - even though I feel capable of doing my job, as I've been off, I don't think I'm given work to my ability as individuals don't want to be let down I.e Id I go off work againI don't know why exactly I'm scared of work but I think it's due to the physical symptoms I get and the worse fear being im either going to pass out, have an asthma attack or die ( please don't judge me if these are irrational).Also whilst at home I feel safer.I get shaky hands, heart racing, feel as if my throat is closing up, really hot, tearful, mind racing, chest tightness, out of breath.The last 2 make me scared most as I don't know if it's due to my anxiety/panic or asthma.I am currently having CBT to try and help but I really am struggling.Can anyone advise me what I should do? Or even words of encouragement?
