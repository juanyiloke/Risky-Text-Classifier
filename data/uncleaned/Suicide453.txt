Good bye worldElleI was diagnosed with depression about a year year ago, the same time I started cutting myself… I feel like killing myself… I have had so much go on in my life at the moment, I really can’t handle this any longer… I said at the start of his year that I was prepared to to take the weight of the work on my shoulders…. When I said that…. I ment that I was happy to take a couple of people’s problem on my shoulders, I didn’t mean for the weight of the world to literly crush me with my own problems… Bye world…. Thanks for everything!
