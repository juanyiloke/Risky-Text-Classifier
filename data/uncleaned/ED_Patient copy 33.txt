i dont know what to do next ?I am 20 yrs old female , i used to binge and make myself sick about 3 years ago , i dropped about a stone and a half in weight to 8stone 7lbs , i told my boyfriend about the binging and purging but he could not really help so i told my mum , she took me to the GP which i was very reluctent as i felt i was not skinny enough to go to a specialist for help as i started to get heart palputations , nd i was transferred to a councillor , i had one session and that was it the councillor said i didnt need anymore , i felt so stupid and felt like a fraud for going to get help although i still had issues about my body image i managed to stop the binging and purging as i felt guilty as i told my mum i wouldnt do it anymore .2 years later and i had put on about 4 stone back on i was 13stone and feeling disscusted in myself so in sept 2014 i started slimming word as well as purging in the evening i started only doing it a few times here and there and then all the feelings came back from before , eating healthy then binging then purging then relief , i have lost 2 stone now through bingeing and purging im now doing it on a daily basis and am feeling out of control to the point where i cant go a day without making myself vomit , do i go to the GP or just leave it to sort itself out , i feel ashamed to tell my mum and boyfreind but am feeling pretty low atm please help !!!
