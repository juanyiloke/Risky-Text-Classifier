Eating disorders and exercise?Hi allI hope people don't mind me posting here, I'm really just looking for some advice.I've recently started teaching some gym classes, and in my Saturday class there's a lady who I am aware has anorexia. I'm a bit concerned that she's consistently pushing herself too hard and that the class is not healthy for her (I had to go and reduce her weights and get her to take a break yesterday, as she was looking very faint etc).ÊI really want to try and support her, and I'm happy for her to be in my classes if she finds it helpful, but I don't want her to cause herself harm and I just don't know how to address it. She's relatively new, and has obviously passed the gym's medical clearances.Long story short, how would I be best addressing this with her? I obviously don't want to offend or upset her, and I really have very little experience of EDs. I've done the practical 'should and shouldn't' in terms of medically, but in terms of managing the emotional side, and giving her ownership, rather than just blanket saying 'you can't be in my classes', unless that would be helpful?Sorry, this is very rambling, but thanks in advance for your help.
