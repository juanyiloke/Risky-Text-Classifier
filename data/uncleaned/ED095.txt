Food IntolerancesI have a fear of eating most things since I often have an "intolerance" reaction and sometimes a throat closing allergic reaction. This is really scary and makes eating frightening. I live alone so am afraid to try new things here. I'll do it when I'm with someone, but not alone because I may not be able to get help for myself in time. This is all new to me. I discovered my gluten intolerance last September and have mostly avoided gluten since then. I discovered last week that instant coffee has gluten! That explains a lot of my symptoms over the past month and switching to weak brewed coffee has made a big difference. Naturally I continue to lose weight in this situation. I'm already too thin and need new clothes at this point. I'm seeing a gastroenterologist, but will not be tested (an upper GI endoscopy) till April. Meanwhile . . . back at the ranch, I'm struggling. Going to stay with my daughter and grandkids this weekend so I can try more variety. The pain I get with my sensitivities is pretty bad and makes me feel overly full, not hungry, but in pain. There are other issues I know you'd rather I didn't mention, but they put a damper on social activities. I live in the US, but am having trouble knowing where to go for help. I saw an allergist who told me my problems were intolerances, not allergies (this was before I tried a liquid meal supplement that caused the throat and tongue swelling problem - I called a neighbor to sit with me for 1/2 hour when that happened). I see my GP in mid April and am also seeing an endocrinologist who is doing a great job on my thyroid problem. She got my T3 and T4 numbers into range in one shot. What a doctor!In addition to my health issues, I have a great deal on my plate to accomplish in a limited amount of time. So not having the energy and drive due to inadequate nutrition is unacceptable. I am counting on me and so are others. What do I do?
