We joined a company for the safer cleaning products for my family. Little did I know that after I started using cleaners and my son 13 years old started taking vitamins, his asthma went from using 3 inhalers (including Advair) to not using a single one. He has not had to use his inhalers for going on a year. Because of the weather we have been having here in Denver I have been waiting for this kick up but nothing so far. If you would like to know more information please send me a message. I just wanted to share my story. Thank you Gabriel
