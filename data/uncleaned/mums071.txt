Ds is three and awesome, hitting all milestones and a happy chap. Objectively I can see that he is doing great.Ê

I however have found all aspects of parenting hideously stressful, and was on sertraline for PND for nearly two years. When he was a little baby it was eating and sleeping (used to have full on panic attacks if he didn't nap) and the current thing is potty training. All these completely normal parenting things cause me sleepless nights and massive stress. I hate being so powerless and not being able to MAKE him drink his drink or go for a wee...Ê

I have come to the conclusion that Ds will be an only, but does anyone else feel like this? Everyone else I know seems to have this parenting gig nailed and I'm panicking about why Ds hasn't been for a wee since 8.30am.
