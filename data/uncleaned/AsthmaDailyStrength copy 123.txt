But I need to take them in order to breathe. I just hate the psychiatric side effects. There are five options for me: paranoia, suicidal ideation, thinking I can fly, hallucinations, and nothing. And it's a complete crapshoot as far as which one I get. I was in the ER early this morning and they upped my prednisone dose from 10 mg to 60. So, within hours, I'm suddenly paranoid. I have an appointment with my pulmo in a few hours and I'm gonna have a chat with her about what else we can try besides the steroids. I'm tired of the side effects. Oh, I forgot to mention the 'roid rage. It takes almost nothing for me to be fuming mad. Does anyone else have side effects like this from steroids? How do you handle them? Annie
