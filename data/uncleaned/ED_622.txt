contradicting thoughtsI would have posted this in the old binge eating board but unfortunately that's gone.I am obese medically.This morning I couldn't put a pair of jeans on due to being too small and had the thoughts I'm fat and was thinking of going on a healthy diet again (slimming world)ÊTonight someone upset me and I decided to say sod it and get a pizza takeaway yet this morning thought I was fat and needed to go on a diet.ÊDoes anyone else think one thing but do another? And why do you think it is?ÊLaura xx
