Freestyle LibreHi everyone  It's been a long time since I posted, though I do read the posts regularly. I'm toying with the idea of buying the new Freestyle Libre system. It's not something I could afford to use permanently, but I think it may help for a couple of months, and the initial outlay isn't horrendous.  My control has slackened off recently, mainly just life getting in the way, but I need to stop things getting any worse. I do have access to test strips, but frequently forget to time my after meal tests properly.I've read a few reviews, and  the main downside pointed out is the lack of alarms, since you only see the results when you scan the sensor. I'm not worried about the lack of alarms, I don't particularly need them, I would just want to use it for the continuous information.Does anyone have experience of using it? I'm mainly interested in the accuracy, because it's a lot to pay out if it is very "hit and miss".
