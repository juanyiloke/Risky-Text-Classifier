Rent vs buy2013-04-09, 06:02 PMSo a question to all of you...my bf and I want to get married, however, he is doing his pHd/masters so it will take around 3-4yrs to finish and I still dont know what to do but it will most likely end in study. We are pretty poor, however, at the same time we dont want to wait those 3-4 years and an additional 2 or 3 for full-time work to kick in to be able to afford to buy something in order to get married. However, with renting, is it difficult to save up for a future home? How long did it take you? Im 23 and still living at home, bf lived out of home since he was 18, he is now 30, however moved back last year to save and complete the final undergrad year at uni which was nuts in terms of workload.
