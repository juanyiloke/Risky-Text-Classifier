Êsomething in between anorexia and bulimiaI am not diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia yet I show symptoms of both. I am obsessed with my weight and I am terrified of getting fat (people classify me as skinny and says my bones are starting to show but I don't see myself that way) yet sometimes my cravings for anything edible consumes me and I find myself eating uncontrollably followed by feeling really horrible about myself and sometimes suicidal. Sometimes I can eat other times the mere thought of food repulse me. I enjoy salads and sushi and consider everything else as the "bad stuff". If anyone can simply relate to this and got help somehow please let me know. I've seen psychiatrists, psychologists, my GP and a dietician, been in a clinic and I'm trying to get better but to me, I can't help myself if I don't know exactly what I am dealing with.
