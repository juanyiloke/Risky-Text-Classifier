On xolair________________________________________I am on xolair and have been for almost four years.My asthma got better about 9 months I after I started taking it.However, about the last 18 months it got continually worse.Since mid October I have had 4 asthma attacks and have been to the emerg3 out of the four times.Just frustrated with my asthma.I am on a tapered dose of prednisone hoping to finish it by next week.It is very cold where I live right now which does not help.I am not sleeping great either because of being on prednisone and the rescue inhaler I have been taken almost daily.
