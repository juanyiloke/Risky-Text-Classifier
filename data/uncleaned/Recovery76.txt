21 Days To Happiness? Hmm...Hey guys,So in my obsessive research on how to beat depression, I came across this TED Talk about the five steps you need for happiness. It's a really amusing talk given by this guy named Shawn Anchor:Please pm me for link.I also came across a blog called "Filling My Soul Hole," where a writer spent 30 days following the advice, and blogged almost every day about his experience.Please pm me for link.It's really quite interesting. And I say, it might be worth a shot. So I'm going to start on my own experiment Monday, and I'm posting to see if anyone will join me. It might not work, but I definitely think it's worth a shot, and might help along with all of our therapy sessions and meds and all.Either way, I will try and post periodically about my journey. Here's hoping!
