ongoing treatment HiI was diagnosed with prostate cancer three and a half years ago. It was particularly aggressive and I underwent a radical, this was followed by radio therapy and 3 years hormone treatment. This appeared to be very effective and my psa remained below0.01. I was taken off the hormone drug 3 months ago, a blood test last week revealed my psa has risen to 0.04. There was evidence of cancer cells in my lymph system and these cells are apparently growing, my consultant has planned 3 monthly blood tests and will review the situation after each of these. I am concerned that as my cancer was particularly agressive there is a danger of the cancer spreading quicker than this.Does anyone have experience of a similar situation.ThanksRod
