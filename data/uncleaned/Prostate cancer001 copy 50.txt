18 months post op and another good psa result 18 months post RP. had another undetectable result today. what a relief! still nerve racking going to each test.having tests every 3 months due to ED  problems. Incontinence sorted out after about 2 months post op. viagra and cialis have not worked and i have experienced body aches with cialis and headaches with viagra. so now trying muse.Overall i feel fine and working normally and in gym as much as i used to be pre-op.Hope this helps anyone just diagnosed or going through treatment. i know of plenty of other success stories in my local support group so if you are in the early stages there is alot of hope and great results
