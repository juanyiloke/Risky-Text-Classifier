I Refuse To Give UpWhether my nightmares are caused by all the trauma I went thru from 05 and 08-2014, Either the medication is causing a unwanted side effect or all the heart pounding things I went thru caused it. Either way i know I've dealt with trauma. Don't know if I bounced back and the dreams are no part of that or if they are. I guess I really don't need a dx to surround my self with good hearted ppl who do have the diagnoses and know how to deal with trauma first hand, either way I'm not giving up.
