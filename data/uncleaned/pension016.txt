The Gatwick dilemmaNews fresh off the press in West Sussex says that the powers-that-be are poised to race ahead with a second runway at Gatwick Airport, as soon as they get the go-ahead. So confident are they, they have already appointed the man to oversee the project!Hot on the heels of that news, comes the story of the discovery of one of the biggest underground oil reserves in a long time - which is in a particularly lovely part of the county, and not far from Gatwick. They are saying that they will only be able to tap a small percentage of this find, because of where it is. Just watch: I for one cannot believe they will readily give up on anything as lucrative. I can see a tussle developing as to which interest is going to prevail. They are already trying to ruin this county with the number of new homes planned for the immediate future. If they can't wreck it one way, they will wreck it in another.
