Co-educational or single sex educationI have been thinking about the problems with some of the Birmingham schools.Ê It seems to be more to do with a few people trying to impose a different sort of education on the school than it was designed to have.Ê We have heard about "pushy parents" changing the style of schools in the past so perhaps we need to look at this with a wider view than what conservative Muslims are trying to do.However, it did make me wonder how much our society has changed since we were all going to school.Ê Long before our time both Shakespeare and Cromwell both went to Grammar Schools but these were very different and could hardly be called single sex as there was no equivalent for girls.Ê There were many more single sex state schools when I started my secondary education and there were arguments that girls schools were better for girls and boys schools better for boys although the idea of "allowing" girls into 6th forms to socialise the boys seemed to catch on quite early after the war years.I think that overall I prefer co-eds for both boys and girls but I do feel girls used to make better progress in the STEM subjects in all girls schools and wonder if this is still the case.
