Byetta question.I have been on Byetta now for over a year and last week went to see the diabolical nurse, she asked me how long I had been on Byetta and I said 'over a year...' to which she replied. Perhaps you need to see the doctor because it might be time to come off Byetta.I can find nothing anywhere on the internet that suggests that this drug is time limited.Does anyone here use this drug and can anyone shed any light on this time limited notion for me...Thanks in advanceAsa
