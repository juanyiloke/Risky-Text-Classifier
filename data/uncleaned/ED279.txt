 Verge of being sectionedTonight's the first time I've logged on for a while and I really appreciate the messages in my inbox - thank you!! XxOk, I'm in serious trouble. Big trouble. Because of my restricting, purging, heart palpitations, hypos, problems drinking any fluid, etc, the psychiatrist has told my CPN that I must have an ECG and bloods as they're worried about my physical state. So, yesterday, my CPN relayed this to me but I don't need these tests because I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. And even if I wanted to have these tests which I'm meant to have had regularly over the past three years because of problems with my previous-anorexia, my agoraphobia means that I can't go to a hospital and GP, and I don't want the paramedic car outside my house which is what they've suggested. And she said that, at the moment, it's in my control where and when I have them done but that if I don't arrange the tests and attend, they'll probably assess me under the mental health act. And I just don't need these tests because, amongst other things, I don't want them to have 'evidence ' to haul me into an EDU and I know the results won't be good as I can feel my heart not beating right and I'm very dehydrated but I'm ok because I'm still working and everything else and it's like in being cornered :-( I don't know what to do :-( xx
