Hello there :)So hi, I'm here, and that's a huge step for me.ÊMy name's Susanna and I've been suffering from bulimia for a few years now. There, I said it!ÊI've been seeing a therapist to treat my anxiety and depression issues for the past three years and I recently started discussing my ED too. I completely ignored the matter for three years, because I thought it wasn't that bad and I hoped it would go away once my mood swings, anxiety and low self esteem improved. I was wrong. But now I am determined to recover my life.ÊI have a lot of good things in my life.ÊI don't want my whole life to revolve around food.ÊI want to be healthy and happy. I don't want to panic if my dad wants to take me out for dinner.ÊMy family and friends really helped me fight depression but they don't know anything about my ED. For some reason, I am still ashamed to ask for their help. I'm working on this, too. One step at a time. For the time being, I thought an online support group would be helpful.ÊThanks, people :) What you are doing here is great.
