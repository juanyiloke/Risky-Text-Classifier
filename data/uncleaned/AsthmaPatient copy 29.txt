I've been having shortness of breath just walking up the stairs.  6  Doctor diagnosed me with asthma and gave me an inhaler and I only used it twice since august. Twice in one day. I dont think it worked and I think maybe the doctor miss diagnosed me. Im scared to use my inhaler cause I also suffer from mild panic attacks. Like I am right now cause I feel short of breath. When I used the inhaler it made my heart race and I felt jittery.  Is that normal? My chest feels lil tight and a little pain only when I breath in deep. Whats the worst that can happen if I use the inhaler and I dont have asthma?
