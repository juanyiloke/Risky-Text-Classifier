ÊHaving a tough time.I am having a tough time at the moment and feel the same as when I had my last serious Schizophrenic episode.I almost went fourth and tried committing suicide tonight but for some reason the fuel needle in my car stopped me.I do not understand why but the fact that my fuel was really low prevented me from going through with it even though I felt like there was no hope left.So I just drove until it seemed like I was going to be stranded with out fuel and to my amazement I ended up back home.Standing in my drive way I sat in the car for about 20 minutes before entering the house and just brought myself to the conclusion that if I made it back home now my episode must be done and I need to continue to see this tough time through. Because if something as uncanny as a seriously low tank of fuel can prevent me from committing suicide now, imagine how much I can overcome if my life has meaning to me later.My car saved my life tonight.
