not sure...So I'm not entirely sure where I am at right now in terms of my workout and eating habits. I have never had a problem with anything up until the last year or so I feel like I constantly have a problem with my body image. I am always checking the scale and I am trying to keep my weight very steady. I watch the amount of food I eat per day, and I honestly know that I am not eating enough, but I hate watching the number on the scale go up...even just a pound. I work out regularly, but do not feel that I over do it in that area. I'm just not sure how to get over the number on the scale so that I can relax and not care so much about what I eat. If I have a piece of pizza, I feel like I need to go jump on the treadmill and run it off. I honestly feel like I look alright, but I cant stop being so aware of everything I am eating...
