Do I have Type one diabetes?  4  I'm a 16 (almost 17) year old male.For the past few weeks (maybe about a month now) I've been feeling really, really tired. No matter how much sleep I got. Usually I can cope fine with a couple of hours but now, if I get 8-12 I'll be yawning by 9am and alseep by 10.I'm also REALLY thirsty, and my lips are dried no matter how much I drink. I'm eating more than usual too, but the thirst is the one I really noticed.About a week ago, and then tonight, I wet the bed. This has never happened before. I've been going to th toilet a lot anyway and went before I went to bed.I looked on the NHS's website and it said type 1 diabetes. I looked at the symptoms and another was genital itching, which has also started to happen (though only maybe two or three times a day). Pretty convinced I have T1 but my Mum doesn't seem to believe me and keeps putting off booking a Doctor's appt. Could it just be stress? Haven't told her about the bedwetting yet (when the first one happened I hadn't started putting things together and had assumed it was unrelated).Any help her would really he appreciated.
