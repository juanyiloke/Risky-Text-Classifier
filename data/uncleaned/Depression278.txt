ÊMentor doesn't understand depression and was judgemental,so angry what do I say to her? ÊNikita,Ê3  I feel very much like just dropping my mentor.She had the cheek to tell me off when I told her she didn't understand depression, I was so low yesterday and she said she didn't like it and she wanted her cheerful fun Nikita back.She was judging me bad for being depressed. I said to her it's not as simple as just cheering up and that she didn't understand, and she said,'if anyone understands depression it is me because it runs in my family'.Oh well ok then I must be the only person who is suffering it understands it less than you, I thought, no, I thought ,'fucking cow', you aren't helping and you haven't a clue what you are talking about.I don't want to see her again cos it is all forcing me to go places and she wants to come with me and it is about getting brownie points for the Mental Health Social Work course she is on.Stuff her.I think I am going to ring MIND up put them straight about her and just dump her.Why should I fit in with her attitude so she gets what she needs out of it and I feel patronized when i am ill?
