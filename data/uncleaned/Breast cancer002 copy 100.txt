Disappointment¥	Hi all, well I hoped to be posting a much happier post than this! I had my operation follow - up with the surgeon this morning.  After 6 chemo it really looked like my lump had shrunk considerably and the surgeon really thought that the TM and radiotherapy would be an end to it. Unfortunately not to be. They discovered during the op that it is far more extensive than the scans showed but luckily all still contained in the same breast. It seems that chemo may have shattered it, which is apparently not uncommon - in fact I was warned about it before but like everything "it wasn't gonna happen to me!". So the only option now is mastectomy. My surgeon was as disappointed as me, he has done such a fantastic job and my 'new boob' is healing so well and looks amazing! I cried in his office ... The first time I have cried in front of anyone outside of the house since diagnosis! Made me feel better tho, and now I have told the family I can feel my strength returning. And if anyone asks why I didn't have mastectomy in the first place then they better be prepared for a smack in the mouth!! (Even if only a verbal one) xx
