struggling so much with triggersi dont know what it is tonight but it feels like triggers are coming at me from everywhere. first of all all of my friends and basically support system are busy. this may not seem like a trigger but i have coexisting mental illnesses, and anyway, when i get lonely i get anxious and start feeling bad about myself which feeds into the whole ED problem. i tried to get online to some of the support sites i visit through facebook & such, and people had posted so many triggering posts that i can't get out of my head, and a friend messaged me in private earlier in the day with some really insensitive and triggering things. lastly, i try to calm down and watch tv, and the show im watching makes an eating disorder joke.what in the world is going on?! usually its just one thing at a time to deal with but they're all smacking me right in the face at the same time. i feel so messed up from being triggered and upset that i dont even want to do any of this anymore. i feel like i am losing it.
