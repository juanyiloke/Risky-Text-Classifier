App not workingGreat I thought, an app for android that has the recipe book available at any time. Problem 1 was opening the app. The initial screen appears to say that you need to register but, as I'm already registered I just wanted to log in. Redesign needed. Having logged in I got into the recipe book and found it .... empty. Problem 2 - no recipes.Strangely, the one thing I expected to find in the recipe book was recipes but every single category, low carb, vegetarian, etc etc all contained the same - nothing. If anyone has managed to get it working and got a book full of recipes please please please let us know how you did it.
