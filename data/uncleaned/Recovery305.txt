necessary?Do you feel that sometimes going through a hard time is necessary? I really do question this sometimes. I realize that without details it is difficult to say as every situation is different but i just wondered what you guys think about it. I mean like after a loss of some kind. You know, I heard on the radio that they are starting to talk about grief as a form of depression, to be treated through medication etc. Well, I am not sure whats right and wrong here, i just wonder if sometimes this feeling of loss, is somehow necessary for us to go through, to feel that space. Otherwise we wouldn't really 'know' all the sides of life. I realize this is easy to speak about but when in the depths of despair it's harder to think clearly, rationally about it all. We are not rational beings after all right : )Well, it's just a thought. I know the official line on depression is 'when it no longer allows you to function normally within society, then you may need to be treated' but I somehow feel that it's sometimes alright, and actually, someones right to 'not function normally' sometimes. Don't get me wrong. having gone through depression something i do know is that the world doesn't owe me anything, and that I can't expect something to magically happen without me actively trying to get better, but i feel that there is a general tendency to 'get people better' too quickly these days. That we need to go through stuff sometimes, to feel that...growth?Any thoughts are welcome. Like I said, it's more of an invitation to share your thoughts on the topic than asking for advice.Cheers
