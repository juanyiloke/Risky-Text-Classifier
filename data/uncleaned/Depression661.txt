Anyone seen my "get up and go"?Started by Pen?, 28-02-15 09:06 AM I had it yesterday I am sure, but can't remember where I left it this morning... Had 45 minutes out with the dog, now crashed on the sofa. Really need to go out to the garage/studio and get on with clearing and unpacking and getting things ready for the builders who are coming Monday but at the moment my resolution of staying off the computer all weekend has failed. Maybe I left it under the duvet??...I wonder if I should go back to bed and start again and see if I can find it.
