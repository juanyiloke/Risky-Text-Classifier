Thousand yard stare when thinking normalby celticcracker » Sat Jan 10, 2015 1:19 amDoes anyone here have a thousand yard stare when they are just thinking deeply about something not related to a trauma? I do this all the time, apparently. It creeps people out. Today someone made a comment about it and now I'm really mad about it. I can't stop thinking about it. It keeps tumbling around my mind. ###$! I can't deal with people who think I'm weird. I kind of freeze up. Anyone else do this? Just thinking about an intellectual problem and people start judging you? What do you do about it - the people and the look?
