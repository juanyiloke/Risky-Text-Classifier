Do I have schizophrenia?I don't know what is happening go me for a few years (about 5) I've been really paranoid about everything. I would connect bad things that happen in the world with my bday or some dates or some type of a coincidence and I start pancking. It's making me have severeanxiety and depression. I don't hear any voices or hallucinationa but I think this might be schozophrenia. Help pleasee because if i just have anxiety and depression I wana take 5htp that boosts ur serotonin but if i have schizofrenia i heard too much serotonin causes it. Does anyone have any information about this?
