Is Surgery REALLY justified?Hi Gang:This newbie to your forum would truly appreciate your input.I'm a 71 y/o male in physically decent health (weight hasn't fluctuated in 30 years). Had prostate cancer 4 years ago, the prostate was removed -- residual prostate cancer came back last year -- had 40 sessions of radiation which resulted in a PSA of 0.00.Had only 5 days to celebrate when an unrelated December '13 Cat Scan showed an irregular pulmonary nodule measuring 1.8cm in my right middle lobe. It showed up again in a PET Scan in Mid-March -- same size -- FDG avid with a measured SUV of 3.0.I have no adverse symptoms.The location does not lend itself well to a biopsy and excision seems to be the only other choice. I've been told by my pulmonologist and two cardiothoracic chief surgeons that the nodule has to come out. A wedge re-section, removing a piece of the lung containing the nodule, is Step One and if the lab says it's cancer, the removal of the full right middle lobe is next, while still on the operating table. They would also remove surrounding lymph nodes and chemo would follow later.Normally, with those kind of recommendations, it would be a slam dunk -- just have the surgery, with its accompanying risks, including a 3% national mortality rate. But not matter how I pose the question, none of the docs can seem to adequately answer: "What if it's benign and I do nothing? What bad thing is going to happen?"I have told my wife that if I croak on the operating table and the nodule was benign rendering the surgery a moot point, I may get really upset.All kidding aside, I will be most grateful to anyone who shares their thoughts on the subject and how you would handle the issue if you found yourself facing the same circumstances.Many thanks.
