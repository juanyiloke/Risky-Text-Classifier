New meds- GlucophageJust back from my morning at the doctors.As I'm not tolerating the slow release metformin very well she said I was being put on a different one & it'd take about a week for the metformin to go out of my system. So imagine my surprise when I go to the pharmacy to find they are still metformin just an actual named brand which, according to the pharmacist, is rarely prescribed! It's called Glucophage. It's 500mg. I'm to take one a day for a week, then two a day for a week, then three a day from then on.Hope I don't get the same issues.Also saw the podiatrist, who was great & I found out the corn plasters both Dr & pharmacist last week said I was ok to use were very wrong & it'd made my foot worse!I'm at low risk of foot complications which is good!In all the madness I still don't know what my results are from the blood tests. Think my cholesterol is quite high coz she went on about that & just said they expect my blood levels to be high as I'm newly diagnosed.I'm seeing the diabetic nurse in 10 days so I imagine I can get more info on the results then.
