Emetophobia?Hiya.....im suffering quite badly with Emetophobia. It all kicked off when i was 28, im not 31.The word vomit makes me panic! Im constanley thinking my child has a tummy bug and panic! I feel sick, i panic! It lso doesnt help whn i wake up most mornings feeling nausous , my digestive system is terrible, has been Êfor a few years.But my phobia is getting quite bad now that i dont eat! ÊIf i dont eat,then i will not be sick! thats in my head!, Ive also lost a lot of weight due to this.If i feel hungry then that kind of makes me feel relaxed, its weird how my mind is being like this!!But if i hear one of my friends are ill......it will play on my mind all day and for   ahead!Does anyone else have this??? xxx
