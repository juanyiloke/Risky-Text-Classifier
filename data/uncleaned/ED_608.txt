binge eatingI suffer from depression and schizophrenia and one of my relapse signatures is binge eating. I am already morbidly obese and now I am having trouble finding trousers to fit me due to my obesity.ÊIn the past people have tried to help by saying write down what you eat but I get uber competitive and deliberately eat more than yesterday.ÊIt doesn't help that my parents are pressuring me to go on a diet which due to the antipsychotics I am on I have weight gainBesides apart from the binge eating I am happy being fat.ÊIdk what I want from this thread other than I wanted to let it out and I wanted people to reply.
