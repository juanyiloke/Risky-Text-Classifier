overcome anxiety Ê18    hello everyone,I just wanted to say that it's possible to overcome your anxiety, after nearly suffering with it for 2 years I had given up the hope that I will ever overcome it,I was suffering from internal fear of almost everything and I couldn't even talk about it to anyone I had always had the fear of panic attack or fainting and these thoughts would run throughout my mind whole dayI am just 20 and doing graduation I even thought of quitting the course of 4 years ; one day I thought to think differently as like a child who are free,who don't think what will happen.I kept saying to mumuself it okay to do anything we want in life,and I accepted my anxiety .I finally realised that anxiety is a mental disease and nothing else and I was able to overcome it bcoz I stopped thinking abt it: I got my life back and I started living as I useto be. as free and as confident as I was bcoz it was me and sometimes the situation causing my anxiety and nothing else.for last 5 months I haven't got a panic attack its not that I don't get anxious I do but I have accepted it aa a feeling nothing else be free and overcome ur anxiety and get ur life back just keep saying it's okay and u r always there for yourself
