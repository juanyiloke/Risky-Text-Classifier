Help? Recovered? Struggling?I've battled anorexia/bulimia for ten years. I feel like I'm finally beating it.ÊI'm eating, I'm healthy, I only BP occasionally & I'm so much more happier. That is, until I look in the mirror. I'm not used to seeing myself with so much weight on me. There are two areas (I won't mention so not to trigger) in particular that are breaking my heart...I can't stand them.I don't know how to cope?I'm a perfectionist & now I'm upset because my need has shifted from being skinny to being fit. & I'm not fit enough. I'm just not good enough. I need to be fit & strong but I'm not.ÊI havebt exercised my usual amount this week as I have been on bed rest due to injury (I'd normally workout anyway but I injured my back & can't walk/stand).I'm not seeing anybody in EDS as I was discharged in July. My friend thinks I still need to but I'm unsure.Any advice on how to handle myself/thoughts?
