Work looking to cancel part of my annual leave.________________________________________Interested in getting people's opinions on this. I am fuming!Firstly, I am not one for taking leave or missing work, I have taken one day off in the past six months and no sick days. I have to travel abroad for a family function in early April and given that I knew this last December, I booked two weeks annual leave in January of this year for April. The leave was approved by my manager and signed off officially by HR in the annual leave system in January.A new employee joined my team in January at the same grade. He has been getting preferential treatment; leaving early, coming in late since day one. It has been noted and commented on by a number of team members. On Monday morning, we were discussing plans for the weeks ahead and whilst the work was being allocated, this individual announced to the team, including our manager, that he is taking the first week in April off. This request had not been approved or even submitted at this point. The manager told him that they would discuss the request.Anyway, I was called into a meeting room today and told I needed to cut my leave short, by three days, as my colleague is taking leave and one of us needs to be present to cover the work load. I argued that my leave has been approved since January and he has only submitted his now but I was told that it is not possible to cancel his leave at this point and "the work needs to be done". My leave has not been altered in the HR system, as of now. How best should I handle this? What rights do I have?
