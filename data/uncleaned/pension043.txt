bed blockersI have just seen part of a report on BBC news about bed blockers in a hospital.Ê The report was done from the point of view of getting people out of hospital and they are planning to have lawyers to help them to give people notice and then evict them.Ê I didn't see the whole report but am sure it will be repeated soon and some of you may be interested in watching.Having looked after my Mum when she had Alzheimers I just wonder about the human misery behind this.Ê One particular moment comes back to mind when, very late at night, an A&E doctor said my Mum could go home.Ê This would have meant finding a taxi etc. An older doctor came, looked at my exhausted face and said he thought it might be better to keep her in for the night.Ê I am sure he did that for my benefit and I will always remember and be grateful.Apparently some relatives use an excuse such as 'they are having a wetroom put in and it is not ready yet'.Ê I am an only child so did not have anyone to help me, apart from my OH, who was very good.Ê I see my cousin going through something similar now and she and her husband do not have a life of their own.Ê It revolves around her Mother.I am not clever enough to know the answer but getting lawyers to evict people from hospital seems dreadful to me.Ê I will watch the item again to make sure that I have not got the wrong impression but would be interested in your views if you see it.
