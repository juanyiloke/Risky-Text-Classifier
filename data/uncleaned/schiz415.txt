ÊHelp please with possible schizophrenic symptoms. Possible trigger.Can anyone help me with some schizophrenic type symptoms. Last week I found my 15 year old son about to harm himself. I am so scared I don't leave him alone for a second apart from when he is at school. I have asked school to keep an eye on him but I have been very cagey about the reason why. Today we saw a psychologist who waffled on for an hour but offered no practical help at all. In fact when I said I had locked away all the items in the house that he was going to use to harm himself he snorted and said it wasn't practical. Needless to say I have insisted on an appointment with a psychiatrist next time.ÊMy son has delusions of people following him and talking to him and lately the voices have suggested he kill himself and harm others. The psychologist we saw today suggested that it was just his ASD, like finding your child about to harm himself should be expected somehow.Am I overreacting?
