Returning to Areas Reminiscent of Trauma *Trigger Warning*by insideofmypocket » Tue Nov 25, 2014 4:31 pmHi guys,I haven't officially posted in this forum before, as my PTSD isn't quite as severe as others it seems. However, I did live through two traumatic experiences, one far more recent than the other, and am struggling to find peace and cope.PS: THIS IS SUCH A LONG POST. I APOLOGIZE.**Trigger Warning**From ages 7-9 (roughly, it seems I've blocked the majority of these memories) I was molested almost daily by an older male cousin who was in charge of babysitting myself and my twin brother after school while our parents finished at their jobs. He would send my brother off into another room with another cousin to play video games or watch tv. I was put into therapy as soon as I told my parents, but as both of my parents worked in the courthouse and knew of the stress that came with putting a child through a legal case, decided not to press charges against my cousin (who was 13 at the time). His age was also a huge factor in it ("he's just a kid, did he know what he was doing" type thing), as well as the possibility of his father being abusive. DCFS was brought in for an investigation, I was put in therapy. That's really all I remember.**End first trigger**I was diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, and depression during my early teens, began self mutilating, became suicidal, was put into partial hospitalization/day programs 3 separate times during high school and was constantly put on suicide watch due to a psychotic episode. Became a very heavy drug user from the age of 14 to 20. Growing up in the suburbs of a large city, I became a big raver (i can't help but laugh at that, lol) and began using psychedelic drugs and club drugs so heavily that I began to dissociate regularly. The partial hospitalization programs helped somewhat, but for the most part, my parents were unaware of my drug use and help was not sought on either end. I experienced a few deaths of friends from both suicide and ODs, but continued using drugs regardless. My DOC was ecstasy/MDMA, as it relaxed my severe anxiety and depression enough to make me feel good, comfortable, and happy. It wasn't until I was about 20 that it all came to a halt.**Trigger Warning**As a drug user, I had a very wishy-washy relationship with my parents and sleep. Often, I would stay up all night and finally sleep around 9 or 10 am, and on this specific night, I'd stayed up watching Netflix until around 6 am, when I began feeling strange. The heart palpitations reminded me of the beginning of a panic attack, and so I got out of bed to begin a ritualistic pacing to take my mind off of what I believed to be an impending panic attack. But the palpitations became worse, I began hyperventilating, and went down to tell my mom. She was getting ready for work, knew of my history of panic attacks, and told me to try and lay down on the couch to sort of ground myself. As I laid on the couch, I began to notice my heart beating in an odd rhythm, as it would speed up for 5 or 6 beats before pausing and beating slow once or twice. I called my mom over again, let her check my pulse, and knowing not to scare me outright, she went into her room and apparently googled my symptoms. Upon returning, she told me she was going to take me to the ER "just to be safe" but "it was probably just a panic attack".The ER was just 15 minutes from my house, but the ride there was excruciating. I hadn't used any drugs in over 48 hours, but I was panicking, knowing they'd drug test me and likely blame this on the drugs. Sitting in the traffic of morning rush hour, my body slowly grew numb and the pins and needles were killing me. I told my mom I couldn't breathe and began sobbing. She told me to calm down but obviously, I couldn't. When we reached the ER, they took it as a cardiac case, lead me to the nurse's triage immediately and began an EKG. The nurse put me in a wheelchair and wouldn't let me walk the 10 steps to the first bed in the ER, right in front of the nurse's station. This was my first sign that something bad was actually happening.I was hooked up to everything possible--IVs, EKGs, BP machines, pulse ox, and not to my knowledge, pads to a defibrillator. It was explained to me that my heart rate was jumping from the low 90s to 200+, and that I was in tachycardia and experiencing atrial fibrillation. The nurses were quite sympathetic and gentle, but my ER doctor was a complete nut job, panicking almost as much as I was. The sounds of the ER were enough to make me nervous, the beeping of my heart rate alerting them of a danger zone and the doctors scuffling about to try and figure out what they were going to do. First it was an IV of a medication meant to lower BP and heart rate, then another dose 30 minutes later. My dad had showed up at this point, and my mom was visibly nervous.As this is a learning hospital, students were dragged down in flocks to my room where they talked to me along with every cardiac doctor possible--electrocardiologists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, etc. I was positive that I was now not going to make it out of this situation alive, as they continuously pulled my parents from the room to update them on the plan while keeping me in the dark. About two hours into this situation, my heart rate finally spiked again and I was told that the anesthesiologist would be coming down to put me under. I was completely confused--were they operating? They told me then that they hadn't succeeded in controlling the AFIB, and the only option was to shock it back into it's natural rhythm. As someone who had just turned 20 the month before, I couldn't believe it. I had seen people shocked back to life on dramatic shows like ER growing up, when I had wanted to become a doctor. Was I dying? When my heart spiked to a terrifying 280, alarms were sounding all across the ER and the entire staff was in my room. I was getting something through an IV (something I would later learn was %^#*!@ fentanyl) as the nurse gently told me not to worry and that it was just to relax me. My parents I noticed were now standing at the edge of the curtains, crying. Why were they crying? With nothing but a "stand clear", my body was thrown into the air and I remember a loud beep, my ears ringing, and screaming "F***!". The anesthesiologist hadn't come in time, and the doctor was telling my parents that they'd have to do it while I was conscious with the heaviest dose of a pain killer they could give me.Afterwards, I spent 4 days in the hospital undergoing every procedure possible to try and figure out what had happened. With a complete asshat of a doctor, it was ruled that I had been using amphetamines that had caused the AFIB and that it was essentially my fault. I was sent home to then live in utter fear of even moving from the couch, unable to sleep in my room because I feared walking up a flight of stairs would cause the AFIB again.***** End trigger warning *****I became a shut in for over 6 months, panicking whenever I so much as had to leave the house and sit in the car. Sitting in traffic reminded me of my trip to the hospital, moving caused the fear of AFIB striking again, passing the hospital had my heart racing, and doctors appointments left me in crippling fear. I was sent for a blood test in the following months, as I wasn't an amphetamines user and my doctor thought I might have an adrenal disorder. Before the blood test could even happen, I had experienced the same body numbness, shooting blood pressure, hyperventilating, hot flashes, sweats, paleness, and screaming hysteria. I was rushed to the same ER, given an IV of ativan, and told that I now had PTSD.2 years later, I've avoided doctors like the plague, even panicking to go to therapy because I knew that therapists were also doctors. This fear has left me crippled, and now, I have a handful of appointments coming up to establish care at a new facility. How do you overcome a fear that induces panic that reminds you of what caused you PTSD in the first place?
