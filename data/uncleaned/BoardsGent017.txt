what does everyone do in the evening timehi all,Im a male in my early 30ties, im home from work in the evening ~6, none of family are living locally and Im pretty new in town. I often find the evenings long as I struggle to find things to do, can't remember the last time I did something with others TBH. I swim and go the gym a bit and recently have started playing tag rugby one evening in the week so I don't just sit and surf the net.Im new in town as well and struggling to establish a social circle and was always kinda shy which doesn't helpfor those of you that are single, what leisure activities do you pursue in the evening time ?
