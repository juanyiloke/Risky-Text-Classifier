Êrepressed memorieshi so im not diagnosed yet but i was seen by a cpn about a couple months back and she said my symptoms such as hallucinations and depression are down to trauma.i am going to see a different cpn this week with the secoundry mental health care.my memories are of childhood sexual abuse and i have only been getting memories of it over the past couple of years.Êi was wondering if anyone else as had help with repressed memories?Êor therepy for trauma and did it help?Êthanks
