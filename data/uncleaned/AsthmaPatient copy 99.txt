Is it asthma?Posted 3 months agoHi everyone, I am an 18 year old female who has had some heart problems in the past 5 years but they're on the mend. Last night i was running up a hill for what was a maximum of 30 seconds when suddenly i go this burning sensation right across my chest and into my throat i found it very dificult to breathe and was continously coughing and had this coppery sticky taste in my throat. I started to panic thinking is was something to do with my heart and my legs went weak, i couldnt see properly and had a headache. I eventually got home and my symptoms didn't go for another hour and a half. I put my head inbetween my knees and gulped down freezing cold water as suggested by my asthmatic sister which helped dull some of the symptoms. Today i feel very weak and tired and havent had much of an appetite which is very unusual for me  . I'm unsure whether it is asthma or not because im not sure whether attacks usually last that long or get that serious but if anyone could help to what these symptoms suggest id be so grateful.
