im a 22 year old male the past few months have been a battle with seeing silly and terrifying things, this is my one of my main problems along with disorganized thinking, thought blocking, and "going black" and have no thoughts other anything in my head just compleatly black it sucks visually i have seen dragons in the sky, and people who look like they are from the ring, to my fiance sleeping in bed looking the like exorcist. which could last for hours, also shadows on the wall, and in the room, my reflection looking like it was out to get me, cats, and lights i see lights alot. to many choices or decissions or even conversation, can send me into a confused, stressed out, bent over holding my head wanting to cry not being able to calm my racing thoughts, trying to talk or do anything is near impossible, other times my mind goes black and i cant form words or thoughts in my head, feeling compleatly empty, no injner voice, just silence, all witch have my head pounding from stress just wanting to be able to think form words anything. i also jump around all over the place and my words never come out how i want them to, always explaining things 3 times and still not making sence to anyone. i walk around in a daze with a memory as hazy as a dream wondering to myself if i ready hade that conversation or if it was just a dream/delusion, thinking i have a drink only to relize i finished it hours ago, to forgetting where i am, who i am, forgetting my fiance not knowing we are together, or even who she is. its a terrible and unpredictable rollercoster of feaer of a episode, trying to avoid stress, and people, for fear of what awaits me, a episode whitch has my crying in my chair or sitting in silace in fear for hours trying to make these visions stop, trying to tell myself they arent real and they cant hurt me, like any childs worst nightmare starring you in the face, or walking around the room, sitting in the corner, on the walls, in bed with you, behind you, wanting to scream your head is so filled with vivid monsters, and hundreds of thoughts racing at once, wondering who you are, how your life fell apart, where you are to terrified to eat or go to the bathroom, ashamed of yourself, and afraid. i see a pschologist weekly, have seen a psychiatrist, nerologist, blood work, only to frind i had schizophrenia and my mind was falling apart on me, becoming useless and a hermit, im on risperidal 2 mg for now, im in the process of everything this is the first time going to these places, but have been dealing with more minor parts of this in my early teens, any advice?
