My much loved grandfather died of lung cancer last night. I have nursed him since diagnosis with the support of my husband and family. I have two sons and a baby daughter. Ds1 is 10, ds2 is 6. They were very close to him and although they only saw him once a fortnight or so, they loved him very much, So now I am left with two very emotional and bereaved children, sobbing loudly, clinging, generally unhappy. This I agree is all normal and it will pass, but it is so distressing as there is absolutely nothing I can do to help them except cuddles and kindness and understanding. They saw him when he was unconscious and gave him a kiss goodbye. At the time it felt right. They love him and wanted to say goodbye. Does anyone have any advice??!Hi allam well prepared for some unhappy response to his question so feel free, but we are going to Spain for over 2 weeks in July with out 20 month old DS.Naturally adore him, goes without saying but hes a hyper little guy and on previous holidays have almost come back more stressed as literally don’t get a moment to ourselves (realise this is part other parcel of parenting ok!!).BUT- would it be so awful, having contacted an English run, fab, reputable nanny agency out there, who would come and pick him up, give us a variety of toddler focused activities to take him to Soft play centres, splash around parks etc. so he can also interact with other kids during our stay- and give us 4 hours off- for 5 days out of the 15? So not even every other day.Do you think this is completely selfish? Also trusting the nanny to drive him in her car?Would welcome all thoughts. Thanks.
