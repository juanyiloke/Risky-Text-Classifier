i was 18 and i got pregnant and got married didnt love him but married him for the child. after we moved in he got abusive raped me beat me pushed me down the stairs and made me loss the baby. im 23 now and i still have horrible flashbacks every one and again. it also doesnt help my fiance keeps bringing it up. i pushed it so far down that i forgot for a long time that it happened to me and now my fiance thinks i have ptsd because of stuff i do. when the toilet breaks i feel the need to explain myself to try to not get beat. My fiance has never laid his hands on me and i feel the need to break down somedays when he brings it up in a conversation. any advice?
