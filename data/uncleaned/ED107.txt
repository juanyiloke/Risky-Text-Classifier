Please tell me I'm not the only one...Where to begin.Ok so growing up I was always on the chubby side. Everyone told me it was puppy fat and would do when I become a teenager. It didn't. So then family would start giving me incentives like if I lost weight they would buy me something etc.Nothing worked and I got bigger and eventually when I met my first boyfriend I hit my highest weight up to that point.I joined slimming world and thankfully managed to lose some weight but then I got obsessed with the scales. I weight myself all the time over and over again. I have gone from living off coffee and starving myself to binging and other unhealthy behaviors!!Now I have gone the other end.I have been on every diet in the book, I start a new diet every day but find myself using that as an excuse to binge.I am so full I feel sick but yet I keep thinking about this diet and want to make the most of my last day of freedomI'm sure if this was a new thing it wouldn't be so bad but I do this every week!!!And I have gained weight in 7 months and it's going on by the day! I do a new diet for a few days and the. Back to binging again and the weight goes back on with some added poundsPlease tell me in not the only one to suffer from thisTell me there is a way out??
