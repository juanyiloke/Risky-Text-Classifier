Is there "something wrong" with a guy if he...Doesn't want his future wife to have had sex with 20+ guys?I was talking to some friends and this came up and the girls were all saying that any guy who has a problem with it (i threw out 20 as an arbitrary number) all had a complex and had issues and "something wrong" with them.What was funny to me was that some men agreed with the women. I think there was an element of white knighting going on, as the girl that was the most outspoken is absolutely gorgeous, so some of the lads would have been white knighting in the hopes of keeping any hope alive of something happening between them and her on a drunken night. In fact one guy actually admitted this afterwards lolPersonally I would rather marry a girl with as low an amount of sexual partners as possible, with a virgin being absolutely ideal.
