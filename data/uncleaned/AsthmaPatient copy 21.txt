Asthma disappeared  4  I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 14 but never really needed to use an inhailer 10 years ago I was diagnosed again by a consultant as asthmatic as I was having breathing problems.  I have just been seen by my doctors nurse again for asthma clinic and have been told that I dont have asthma I am now very confused as although my asthma is not bad i do get wheezy at times and do get an asthma cough.  I asked the nurse if asthma can just go away and she said yes I am now 43 and am very confused as I have had to use my inhailer over christmas but I am not astmatic apparently anyone else heard of this ????
