Nutrition in the final phases of chemo....¥	Throughout my chemotherapy (which is still ongoing) I have been quite obsessed with nutrition. I use specific things to help me avoid the side effects chemo brings, as well as to keep my immune system strong and try to stop myself from becoming anaemic and fatigued (if that's possible during chemo!).  :)¥	I've been through 3 months of EC treatment and now I'm on a weekly chemo session of Taxol (Paclitaxol) for 12 weeks. I'm half way through this, as of today ((little jump for joy and a big Yippeee!!)). During chemo, I've found nutrition to be of the utmost importance. Every week I seem to be tweaking what I do. My blood tells me if it's working or not and more times than not - the things I do always have a positive effect.¥	As my blog is becoming quite big, I thought I'd write a specific page about what I'm doing right now. It might help others to avoid side effects. So far (touch wood) I have not felt nauseous or been sick. I've only suffered a sore mouth a few times and that was only really overnight on both occasions. I haven't had constipation, gotten sick (colds etc) or had any infections or high temperatures.¥	The only things I've suffered with is shortness of breath and feeling fatigued from low red blood cells - this is normal. This stuff is relevant to me... but I thought it might help someone else too... so here it is people! I'm happy to answer any questions and I really hope it helps someone else. :) x¥	https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/nutrition-version-3-april-2015/¥	Keep smiling.xxx
