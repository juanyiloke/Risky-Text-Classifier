30 years old, £120,000 ($200,000) in the bank - what do I do with it?2013-12-22, 03:44 PMNew poster on this site; currently taking stock of my life.I've just turned 30, and have no debt and £120,000 ($200,000) that is sitting doing nothing for me.I have a secure job, and rent an apartment.I don't have a clue what to do with the money (this is not a trolling post, I'm being totally honest) - I'd be interested in knowing what others on this forum think is the best thing to do with this money to preserve what wealth I have or grow it.ÊBasically I don't think I've 'lived' enough so want to have enough money to achieve a good work/life balance - think '4 hour work week' and 'your money or your life' kind of thing...
