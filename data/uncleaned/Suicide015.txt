getting no better...Hi everyone...posting again as my Body Dismorphia is completely out of control. I don't know how I can carry on. Anyone with BD on site? I am very close to the edge, the only thing that is stopping me is my lovely partner and fab friends. I can't engage with anything and just mope around all day waiting for bedtime so I can go to bed and not sleep. My business is going down the pan, I have orders and I just can't get on with them. I am taking 20mg of Citalopram and hoping it kicks in soon, mental health care in the Uk is rubbish.I am convinced that my BDD problem, my eye bags are getting worse daily, and because I cried a few weeks ago they have not gone back.ÊI am constantly checking mirrors and having to take valium to calm me. I am taking sleeping tablets, which my partner has hidden. Also hid the valium and just gives it me when I need it which can be daily. I am in a real mess and don't know what to do next or how to survive this terrible illness. I don't have any fight left.ÊPlease help....Sophie ? xx
