How high do you get before "feeling" high?For me I get high blood sugar symptoms when the blood sugar hits and stays at anything above 8, by symptoms I mean thirsty, slightly dry mouth, dry lips and eyes and a more than convenient number of toilet stops. I also get a bit muzzy and get little mouth ulcers (caused by a dry mouth), and feel grumpy. This is the reason I like to stay below 7 if I can help it. My stunningly empathic and intuitive medical team (see I'm calm enough to crack a funny now  ) think it's psychological because those symptoms don't occur until blood sugar goes into double figures and because they all think I'm obsessed with tight control (I'm not I just want to feel normal as much of the time as possible). So is it unusual to feel symptoms of high blood sugar when not officially "high"?
