Didn't take my meds today, advice needed? Thank you for being here, I'm sorry I go on, I was wondering if you you could help, I didn't take my meds today, when I went out I had so much nervous, I'm not sure if it was me or because I didn't take my meds? I was wondering if I should take them now or just wait till tomorrow. I'm scared not taking them, because if today is to go by then I really don't want to go through it again. I don't always know what is the truth no more, I get so confused.
