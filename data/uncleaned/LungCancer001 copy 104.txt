  i need advice because i am freaking outhi my name is Darren, I will be 25 next month and have been smoking for the best part of 10 years on and off and have recently started getting sharp pains in my chest and a load of really awful headaches that come and go! I also just recently stopped there with my wife only to start having sneaky ones and hiding packs in my car and under our bed! now heres a list of things that make me actually terrified to my very soul1. Family history-anyone who smoked died of lung cancer the youngest being my gran at 41,followed by her 4 sisters and one that didn't smoke but died of empysema due to working in a pub years ago and exposed to tobacco smoke2.even since I started smoking I can never smoke a cigarette first thing in the morning because of the phlegm build up I end up baulking! the only time I can smoke is when I have eaten somethinganyone have advice for me out there! I have tried everything to stop I know due to history I shouldn't have started in the first place but I am an idiot and followed the crew, now I am 25 not even a year married and freakin out
