more than I can ever remember it. I must have used albuterol 8 times. It would barely last. I keep wheezing and my chest feels tight. I don't think I'm getting sick, but hopefully it's just that? I usually can tell if bronchitis is coming on. My asthma has been fairly consistent. Usually I take Symbicort twice a day which mostly helps (not as good as Advair, but a lot cheaper since I don't have insurance). I'm offSymbicort for the time being, but that's been the case for almost 2 weeks and my asthma was fine until yesterday. I ate fast food on Friday night which I doubt is the reason OR the more possible one, maybe, is that the plumber came to fix a faucet drip in the kitchen. He fixed it, but then I started noticing yesterday that water had little black stuff in it. I've started making sure to not use any unfiltered water, even in tea. Today I feel some improvement. I took a Mucinex so that might have helped. If anyone has any ideas...?
