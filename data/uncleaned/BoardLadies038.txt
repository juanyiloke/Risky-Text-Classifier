Friendships and the people in your lifeHi ladies,How is everyone's social life? Sometimes I can't help but feel mine is somewhat lacking. I always had lots of friends but during college I became quite anxious and pushed people away so as to avoid social situations.I'm over all that now after a lot of hard work and persistence. However, after college it seems to be quite difficult to maintain lasting friendships. I have no bother getting to know people at all but its holding on to them or socialising on a continuous basis that seems to escape me.If I am not working then I could easily go a weekend without hearing from my friends (unless we specifically have plans), usually just getting a call or two from my mam.This is probably a strange question, but how many people (excluding family) would you generally receive calls or texts from during the day? What would be considered a good social life? What is a good way to expand my social circle?
