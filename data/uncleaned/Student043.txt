Any advice?by socially ineptHi, I don't want to name my current institution but I'm currently studying psychology (BSc, coming towards the end of my first year). I have been getting consistently high grades (I've only achieved 3 grades that weren't firsts) and I do feel like I am in fact too smart to be here (without sounding narcissistic). My dilemma is that the teaching is just completely unacceptable to me. I could have got into a better university (A*A*C A-level grades) but I just wasn't feeling confident at all or even expecting the A-level results I achieved. I'm currently looking into transferring to a more prestigious university with better teaching quality and an all-around better university. Should I go through with this or just stick it out for the next two years? If I transfer, I'd be transferring directly into second year. I just feel like I'm wasting my time at a below average institution when I know I'm capable of more. Thank you so much in advance for any advice!
