Qvar?________________________________________Anybody have any experience with Qvar? The doc wasn't happy that I'm still having asthma and having to use the nebuliser twice a day about one week a month, so he wants to change me from Advair to Qvar... since the Advair will be completely unaffordable next year, when we change from good insurance to a stupid 'high deductible, then you pay 20% scheme' I don't mind. I've been on tenterhooks for the last 12 months waiting for the insurance to decide they're not going to pay for my Advair...
