ÊWhere did my emotions go.I am not sure if it is the medication that I take or the illness (schizophrenia) I have but I feel totally emotionless. I dont feel any emotions. I think i feel sad but I do not know why. I have a wonderfull supportive wife and she must be getting really peed off with me now. Normally I can cry but the last 2 years nothing makes me sad.ÊI really love my wife and kids and I dont want them to think that they dont make me happy. It's just me I guess going round and around in circles finding it harder to deal with every time my voices return. I just wish I could take a pill and for everything to be ok.I have tried chlorpromazine,Haldo,quitiapine,risperidone,Flupen thixol,Zuclopenthixol. They even tried me with clozapine but my white cell count is too low for me to start it.I currently take50 mg risperidone consta depot and 20 mg of olanzapine and 150mg of sertraline.ÊSorry for this ramble I have kinda gone off topic in my own thread.
