Vaginismus at 24I'm female, heterosexual and will turn 25 this year. I have had three "sexual partners" in my life. I put sexual partners in inverted commas because I have actually not been able to have penetrative intercourse with any of them. For as long as i can remember, my vagina has always felt "closed". When I was a teenager, I couldn't finger myself, or when I did it was very painful, but I presumed that it would be different with an actual penis. I presumed wrong. Every time a guy has tried to penetrate me, it's like hitting a brick wall. The best that can be achieved is with a finger, which is painful. Despite this physical condition, I consider myself to have a normal/healthy sexual appetite. I masturbate. I get aroused, my vagina lubricates, I desire penetrative sex and all that, but I just can't have it. It's like my body just wasn't designed for it. I believe this to be the reason the love of my life lost interest in me. He never mentioned it, but I figure he just didn't want to appear disrespectful/sex-crazed. I was able to get him off in other ways, but he was never able to penetrate me properly. Things that may be relevant: I had a typically repressive Irish Catholic upbringing. I have OCD and for a long time especially when I was a teenager I was extremely self-conscious and suffered from low self-esteem. I developed anorexia which in later years turned into orthorexia which turned into binge-eating/EDNOS. Is it possible that I was simply born physically abnormal? I'll answer further questions.
