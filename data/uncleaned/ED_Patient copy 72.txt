Is there no help out there?I've been suffering with an eating disorder for nearly 15 years now.I've had intensive inpatient treatment, day care and outpatient therapy...etc.I'm currently paying privately for outpatient, because I'm too stable for NHS services but had a major relapse last year, and couldn't have coped without treatment (otherwise I would have ended up in an NHS inpatient unit).I should note I have since ended up in A and E three times this year with eating disorder related symptoms.I've made so much progress this time round, but my therapist announced that she's going to me moving on in January, and I'm so scared, because I'm not ready. I need more time and although she's given me plenty of warning (and time to prepare with my dietician) there is no way I'll be ready by Jan to be discharged from outpatient services.Can anyone relate to this, and does anyone have any suggestions of alternatives.The NHS services are not an option. I've been through the assessment pathway, and unless I make myself seriously unwell I won't even get offered outpatient treatment.  Most community services require an NHS referral so you have to be in the system to get this.It's just bad timing!
