How to distinguish between inner thought and auditory hallucinations?I have childhood onset schizophrenia and have had auditory hallucinations ever since I can remember. Thus I have never had a reverence I could use as to what is normal, because I don't have a clear "before" and "after" onset experience.How do I know when it is a hallucination, or just inner thought? I am on new medication and I have to know when I am clear of symptoms, so that I can report it to my doctor.Can the continuous voice commentating my actions just be an overflow of inner thought, or is it an clear hallucination?I have another voice that keeps telling me that I am not schizophrenic and that it is all just me thinking. Since I don't recognize this voice as one of my regulars, can it actually just be my own inner thoughts?I am really confused at the moment and some advice would really help.
