Since I have had my ds2 i find I am more reliant on TV to keep my ds1 occupied when I have things to do e.g. housework, cooking, putting baby to sleep, showering or even just having a moment to myself to relax. I am finding that I am starting to use it as a crutch but it is having negative consequences on ds1 behaviour. He doesnt want to go out anymore (i know this as he tells me this and throws tantrums if I start trying to get him ready to leave the house) and would prefer to sit in watching cartoons. Another source of conflict is how long he gets to watch tv and what he can watch on it (prior to baby 2 he would watch only 30mins a day and only a set number of cartoons but now he is quite demanding about what he wants to watch). He also plays with his toys leas and reads less then before. I kind of want to just get ris of it completely but am really at a loss yo how I will keep him occupied without it. Any ideas or insights on how you manage to find time for yourself to do what you need to do.
