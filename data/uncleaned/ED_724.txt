Please help, freaking out!!!I've been feeling really insecure about my weight lately. I am technically "recovered", but I am feeling hopeless about finding a balance between eating and exercise. I thought I have a highly active lifestyle, but maybe not active enough. I maybe have been eating too much, but I don't feel like I can stop. I'm using food as a coping mechanism now for my stress and loneliness. I'm so confused and feel fat and horrible. I'm triggered by so much around me.My big issue is that this morning, for the first time in months, I found out my weight. I'm more than I thought, heavier than I ever thought I'd be again. I feel like I have a complete lack of will power, and am so full of self hatred and criticism. I know I need to talk out my problems, but I feel the need to hold them inside and swear off eating again. I'm in school, shaking and trying not to break down.
