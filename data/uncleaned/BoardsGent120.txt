Men and the mother and baby homesI am wonder what thought do you have on men and the mother and baby homes.The church gets talked about.The woman gets talked about.Society at the time gets mentioned.You rarely hear from the men and as it takes two to get pregnant for every mother and baby in the homes there must have been a man who got the mother pregnant.That means there were and are thousand men out there maybe old now, who either raped the woman, abandon them after sex or after a relationship, felt the woman were repugnant to them because they were willing to have sex with them before marriage as was the convention of the time and let them go in to mother and baby homes because they were seen as somehow not chase. The men's lives were never ruined they went on to married more respectable or suitable women, Not all men of course theire were some I am sure who were devastated by what happened but most did not seem to care.
