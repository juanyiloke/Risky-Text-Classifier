Long term depressionHi. I have been depressed for a number of years and have only been minimally helped by medication. I still take meds and haven't given up on trying new ones. I have been on Prozac and Geodon, prozac most recently increased. I am trying to be hopeful that it will get better. I have a counselor who has not been helpful and am thinking of switching to a new one, yet I haven't got the courage to do so yet. I need advice on what to do regarding motivation. What motivates you to do things like exercise or even take a bath? I do try to pat myself on the back when I do anything productive. I manage to feed myself and my pets and take my dog for a walk yet I want to do more. Just haven't the energy. I'm hoping the prozac will increase my energy eventually. I occasionally have thoughts that life is just too hard and don't try to entertain any ideas of offing myself for very long. One night last week I had the bad thoughts and I went to sleep hoping I would feel better the next day. The next day I felt bad, too, but the day after I felt somewhat better. Oh yes, I have some physical illnesses, too. I have a fatty liver and COPD. The COPD is mild yet. Don't know if it is making me not want to do anything but I guess I should ask my doctor about that. Thanks for reading this.
