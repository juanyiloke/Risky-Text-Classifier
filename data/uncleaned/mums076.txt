Im sure (secretly hoping) this has been written a million times before...Today has been such a bloody hard day. DD1 is 3 in a couple of weeks and DD2 is just 10 weeks old. DD1 is so emotional and clingy at the moment whether this is still something to do with her baby sister or not I don't know. I obviously can't always be with her, even if DD2 is quite happy otherwise no one would get their dinner etc. This is what happened today...please don't judge  DD1 was asking for a cuddle more like nagging actually but I was trying to settle the baby to sleep - so I could spend some quality time with DD1. I explained this to her but she just carried on winging and asking for me to carry her, in the end she screamed which startled the baby. This led to me shouting at DD1 telling her it's her fault why I can't spend time with her because she's the one that woke the baby. Que tears. I'm not proud at all, I know this isn't going to help with her emotional state. Anyway things calmed down , baby was happy in her bouncy chair so me and DD1 had some nice cuddles and playing on the floor. Just a few minutes in she stamped on my chest which did hurt but shocked me more than anything. I really shouted which led to more tears, I told her to leave me alone so I could have some time out. Of course she followed me. I could feel myself losing control so I needed some breathing space. We normally have quite a structured discipline routine but I just lost sight of that and lost control of my temper. Of course now I feel really guilty and not sure how I'm supposed to be coping right now? Everyone says how strong I am and a good mum etc but they see none of this crap. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance and/or tips for managing on a day to day basis? Sometimes I feel like super mum then it all comes crashing down.
