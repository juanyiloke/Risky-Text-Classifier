my fear keeps building and building...  7  I have   some days ago about my type 2 diabetes diagnosis from earlier this year.  I have dome research and research till the point my family are telling me to stop. But I'm starting to get really really frightened. I literally can't stop thing that I might have progressed symptoms of neuropathy and damage to me internally and that will contribute to an early death. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm especially scared because I'm just 30. And all the information I've been reading all point to at least 10 to 15 years shaved off my life span.  And how everyone says they have a team of doctors. I've only seen my gp but have asked several times about how I'm doing and if I need to see different specialists. He said he would refer me to a neurologist but that's so far.  I'm really sad and very frightened
