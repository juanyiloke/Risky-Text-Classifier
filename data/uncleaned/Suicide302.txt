Girl I love is in love with another guyWell basically I've known this girl for almost a year now and have been talking to each other every day. At first I only saw her as a friend but as I got to know her more and the more we spent time with each other I began developing strong feelings for her. Now to be fair she was already with someone when we first met and from what I could tell she was strongly in love with this guy. I know it is probably my fault for falling in love with a girl who was already with someone but I couldn't help it. I was really lonely and she was the only person who ever talked to me every day.ÊI told her about how I really feel about her but she told me that she will never see me that way because she loves her partner "way too much".ÊNiceShe told me "I'm sorry but I'm really really happy with my partner." It really hurt me when she said it like that. I put so much into this girl yet she's in love with someone else.Someone else will get to have her and not me.I always lose like usual. I just don't know how to get over this. life is just so unfair. They will probably go on to get married and have a happy life while I'm the loser who will be alone forever and probably end up killing myself. I just don't know how much longer I can do this
