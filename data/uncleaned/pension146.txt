Steve Webb W & P minister interviewHi, just a few words to introduce myself as I have just enrolled primarily to find out the general thoughts on the new pension scheme. I am appalled that the government believes that today's pensioners are 2nd class citizens. I do not as yet draw the state pension but no doubt I will be eligible just before the scheme comes into force. I have been listening to the work and pensions minister, Steve Webb, when pressed on the question "will the present pensioners be as well off as the new pensioners" he gave a typical politicians answer (lots of words which say nothing) and the presenter of BBC breakfast show let him off the hook, what a wimp or has he been told to go easy on Webb. The British people have been let down by their politicians for far too long, it is time now to tell them they work for us.Gordon
