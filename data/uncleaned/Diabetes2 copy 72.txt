UC and Type 1 Diabetes   I have suffered from UC and Type 1 Diabetes for over 10 years and am now considering elective surgery for UC as flare ups are increasingly difficult to manage. I take Azathrioprine daily and have to go on Prednisolene when flare ups occur which plays havoc with my blood sugar levels for several weeks. Very tiring.Also, a simple bruise recently turned into a major vein infection as my immune system is weakened. Being 52, albeit pretty fit generally, doesn't help either!Two Main Questions:Does anyone have experience of both of these conditions please?Are there any issues or options I should be aware of when considering surgery?It seems a lot of medical expertise is focussed on single conditions and interactions between them are not well addressed. it's often the treatments that created the problems, not the conditions themselves.My hope is that surgery will eliminate UC. However, I expect there will be situations to manage in life after the operations eg pouch issues and infections which could well require drugs to manage and control them. Some of these will continue to play havoc with blood sugars and I'd like to make sure the best decisions are taken about sugery to reduce this risk.
