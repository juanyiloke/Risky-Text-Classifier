Redress on Missold PensionsI had an old company pension which I was advised to transfer to a private scheme. This transfer was subject to a review carried out by the FSA and was found to be the subject of misselling.Ê An award for redress was made in 2002 and added to my private pension. I was somewhat taken aback when I retired in 2013 to find that the redress value only amounted to a lump sum of £4711.14. This figure only bought me back to the guaranteed amount of my old company pension for eighteen months - a far cry from the promise made in the FSA Factsheet which unambiguously stated that the aim of the review was to return people who had been missold a private pension to the position they would have been in had the not been badly advised to transfer their pension from a company scheme. The difference in the pension I am receiving now of £4085.28 per year and the guaranteed figure of £8383.71 increasing by 4% per annum offered by my old company scheme is so vastly different that I cannot comprehend how the calculation carried out by The FSA and The FSCS can be defended. This coming year my pension will still be £4711.14 compared with £9067.82 that I would have received under my old company pension. I have taken this matter up with The FSA. The FSCS and my MP and to-date nobody has come up with an explanation of how this vast difference has occurred nor answered a number of questions I have raised. I will be pursuing this matter further and would be interested to hear if anyone else has suffered a similar experience.
