rib pain¥	Hi everyone hope you're all enjoying your Sunday. I'm letting my mind run away with me and was wondering if anyone could set my mind at ease a bit. I've had some pain in my ribcage and the lower part of my breast for about 3 days now. It isn't sore unless I'm stretching or I press on it. I've tried telling myself that it's probably just my body healing from my operation 2 weeks ago but my mind is running away with me and I'm worried the cancer has spread to my ribs. I'm not swollen or inflamed. Has anyone else experienced this?x
