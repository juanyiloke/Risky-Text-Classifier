I am scared I may have cancer.Hi allIn March 2013 I went for a review appointment/chest x ray at the hospital as I'd had pneumonia last summer.The doctor said he found a cavity in my lung and wanted to do a CT scan. I had that done a couple of months ago and they found out it was actually a 'lump'. So, I'd been undergoing many tests and 2-3 weeks ago whilst collecting my PET scan results the doctor told me I'd need a biopsy. He said in his own words 'there is a chance it could be cancer'. I cried when I left the hospital that day.I am so scared of the thought of this disease, I have started reading up on everything an anything to do with cancer. And started to clean up my diet...I have no real noticeable symptoms - just noticed that I do wheeze a little more than usual. The lump is in my left lung. I am a non smoker and never smoked much in my life even in my younger days. However I could say I was exposed to considerable passive smoking at one point.I worry about my family and I keep thinking ....I wanna see my 7 year old son grow up. Some of my family are telling me not to jump to conclusions yet...but I can't help but think of the worst case scenario.I pick up my biopsy results today - really panicking! As I have been waiting 10 days.Any advice would be appreciated!!Jen
