Ultrasound results¥	Hi All¥	Wonder if anyone can help?¥	I have had abdom pains on and off since chemo no 5 over 18 mths ago. I had ultrasound and CT scan after chemo - liver/gall bladder was fine but they found diverticular disease. For the last 5 months I have had daily pain in right side and now radiating into back. My GP has put me on amitriptyline after trying anti spasmodics which didn't work. Paracetemol does help a bit. My onc has referred me to a gastro consultant but ordered another ultrasound of liver whilst I am waiting. Liver blood tests and tumor marker tests came back normal. I have app to see onc 22nd May.¥	My question is - do they usually tell you at the scan or after a week? When I had first US a while agon the person doing it told me there and then that the scan was fine. There was a cyst but no evidence of disease. This time the operator was terse - no eye contact and was typing at her computer when I left - no goodbye. She had said the results would take a week. I felt upset -  it seemed irrational but I guess I was/am more anxious than I like to admit. Some staff may adhere to a strict no comment policy and others not but her being so tight lipped worried me.....¥	Thank you¥	X
