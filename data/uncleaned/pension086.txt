Funeral expenses.Having just learned what a neighbours funeral cost, and it was not a fancy one but very plain has made me think about any of the family that may pass on.  Do you get any help from the government or councils? Anyone living on a pension must find it a worry thinking about the expense for those that have to deal with a funeral after a death. Which is cheapest a cremation or church burial?  Sorry about this morbid subject but it has just given me terrible thoughts about family deaths and being able to  pay for a decent burial.
