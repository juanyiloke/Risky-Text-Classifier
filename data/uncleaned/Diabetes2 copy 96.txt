Pioglitazone newly prescribed   I have been prescribed this medication by my gp due to an inability to manage with metformin. My prescription was for a total of 7 x 15mg tab. The pharmacy dispensed the prescription, placing it into a plain white box, with the name of the drug on a printed label and stating take one daily. However there was no information given regarding possible side effects, how to store the medicine, whether it was to be taken with food or not, etcI am greatly disappointed by the treatment from my gp, who had not seen me prior to prescribing this medication,and therefore was aware of the fact that I had never had this drug before. Also by prescribing 7 tablets in total, without asking me to make a further appointment to discuss my progress with the medication, I am unsure what exactly was expected to happen. When dispensed by the pharmacy, only 6 tablets were actually given. All in all a very disappointing experience. :cry:
