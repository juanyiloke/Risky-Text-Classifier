Workplace gaffe2012-10-20, 12:02 AMI've been in a new position for about 4 months. Part of my role that I've been doing for a month or so involves sending out letters (that entail to our organization). During the last 1/2 hour before we were leaving I accidentally grabbed the wrong envelopes so my letters ( and everyone elses which is 4 or five people) were sent with the wrong return address. Someone else caught this but if they hadn't, these letters would have been sent with the wrong envelopes. It was really just a horrible day to the ending of a horrible week..I plan to discuss this with my supervisor but I want to hear from managers. How big of a mistake is this?
