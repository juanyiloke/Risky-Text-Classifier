feeling low todayJust back from the hospital and following my recent scans I have now been told I have thyroid cancer as well as stage 4 bowel cancer with spread to my liver and lung. The good news is that all would appear to be operable but just don't know if I have the strength to go through this. I am seeing the bowel surgeon to discuss my options tomorrow. I am a 52 year old who loves life and I cannot believe this is happening to me and my family. I know I am not alone and I need to keep positive as it is the best way to be but sometimes this is difficult when every time you have a scan something new appears.
