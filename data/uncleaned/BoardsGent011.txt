Best Barber / Beard Trim in DublinI threw up a post in the Facial Hair forum about where to go, but didn't get any replies.I need a haircut and want to shave off my beard at the same time. Have had it for about a year and a half now and fancy a change.Where would you recommend for it? I've been to The Waldorf for a haircut many a time, but have never had a hot towel shave and think this warrants it.
