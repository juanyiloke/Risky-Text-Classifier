Strep Maddie had strep A in her lungs last June which meant a visit to HDU for a few days.Yesterday she started complaining of a sore throat ehich I've presumed viral so have adopted the watch and wait approach. However this evening I took a look inside her throat and it's evident that things aren't great. I stupidly googled images and her throat completely matches Strep throat!! Sooo my question is..can Strep travel from throat to lungs????Last time we had very little warning things weren't right..Prob a couple of hours of breathing problems. It's now nighttime and I'm a little worried. She's fine in every other way. Her Asthma is behaving itself too.
