I posted a brief summary a little while ago- at the time I really wasn't sure how much I wanted to share. I guess I try to keep Myself pretty guareded. So I will better try to explain why I am here. My daughter was dx with leukemia at the age of 3 1/2 this was in April 2000. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood so treatment for it last 2 1/2 yrs, treatment meaning Chemotherapy. She did well those 2 1/2 yrs a few little Hosp. Stays but nothing major. 16 months after she completed all her treatment her cancer came back. She was 7 at this point She needed 2 more yrs of very intense chemo to try and cure her. It was a horribly hard 2 yrs, many many hospital stays. 3 months after her cancer came back Our 21 month old son was dx with the same leukemia. Yes, it is vey rare to Have siblings dx with the same cancer and we don't think there are any genetic Reasons. I was the main care taker for my sick kids. I did all the hospital stays all the meds All the caring for their central lines. My husband worked and cared for our other two older children My daughter finally finished her 2nd round of treatment, my so. Finished soon after. 14 months after my daughter finished her treatment her cancer came back yet again. She was 10 yrs old Our son has done very well and is currently 4 yrs cancer free, after 1 more year and he will be considered cured. Our daughter now needed a bone marrow transplant for her only chance to survive 8 very long months at the childrens Hosp and our beautiful 11 yr old daughter passed Away due to many complications. She fought cancer for 8 years. I have 8 years of horrible Memories. I live every day with those memories and intense fear that our sons Cancer will come back. She passes away 12/8/07. This time of yr is extremely Hard not o ly on me but for my whole family. I just recently went back to a therapist in hopes to find some help. She dx me with PTSD and major depression. Thank you for reading my post.
