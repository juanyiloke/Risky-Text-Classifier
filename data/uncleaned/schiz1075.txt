SchizoaffectiveI have been diagnosed with depressive-bipolar and schizoaffective disorder in 2009. My father is schizophrenic, as well as his mother. I don't really know anything about these disorders. I've been hospitalized once when the episodes started at about 15. (I'm 20 now.) And I went to an Intensive Outpatient Program November of last year.Since then, I've become anti-social, paranoid, and terrified of the dark as well as of myself. I have strange feelings, usually always feel like I'm being watched, even when no one is there, and I see these disfigured dead-like things. I've even started seeing them in my sleep. I feel like I'm going crazy.Any information, advice or insight would be gratefully appreciated.
