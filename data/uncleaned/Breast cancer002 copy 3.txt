Positive NewsHi Everyone, I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of January 2015. I have lobular cancer in my left breast with a mass that measured 5cm. Initially I was told I would need to have a mastectomy because of the size of the tumour. When I seen the Oncologist in February I was given the option to have chemotherapy first to try and shrink the mass so that I might have a chance of saving my breast but there were no guarantee's as I was also told that lobular cancer is unpredictable. I've had 4 chemo sessions so far and today after seeing the Oncologist he says the chemo is working and my tumour has shrunk by half and I've still 2 more treatments to go, so pretty positive news All being well the tumour will be even smaller by the time I go for surgery early August then it'll be followed by radiotherapy. I am so relieved and wanted to share my good news with everyone and tell anyone out there in the same boat not to give up hope and stay positive.
