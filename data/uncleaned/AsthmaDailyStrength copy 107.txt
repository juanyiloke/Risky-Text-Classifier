So I've has asthma pretty much my whole life, and for the past few years I've had it pretty well under control. Allergies can trigger an attack, exercise can trigger an attack, etc, but I've learned to deal with it the best that I can. For a while I was into running, and would average about 3 miles per run without having an asthma attack. I injured my knee though and had to take about 6 months off. I'm ready to get back in to running, and I went to the track the other day to get a run in. After 1/8th of a mile I felt like I was going to die. It was like I never ran a day in my life. I had the whole shortness of breath, tightness in my chest, wheezing like I was a 2 pack a day smoker thing going on. What the heck? Has anyone else experienced this? Will I ever be able to get back to running? I have a sprint Triathlon coming up in October, which gives me plenty of time to get back to 3-4 miles. My problem is that when I go in for my next physical therapy session for my knee in a few days they want to do a run assessment to give me suggestions on what I should/shouldn't be doing to prevent further injury to my knees. This assessment is obviously something that I really need, and it would be beneficial to me. I'm not sure how long a run assessment in PT is going to take, but I dont think my lungs are going to be able to take it. I'm open to any advice/feedback that anyone can give me. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?
