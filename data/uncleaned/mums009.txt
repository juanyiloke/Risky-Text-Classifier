Dd is 4 months and for the last month has woken almost consistently at 45min intervals with a slightly longer sleep at the beginning of the night. She seems genuinely hungry when she wakes.I'm proud to be solely breastfeeding but now contemplating giving a bottle of formula at night to fill her tum. Am I doing her a disservice by doing this? Will just be filling her with empty calories when she could be having nutritious booby?I'm aware that it may not even work, but if it does it could mean a lot more sleep for me and her.Opinions?
