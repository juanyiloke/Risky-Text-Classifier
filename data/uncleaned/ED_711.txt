Running Out of HopeI'm new to RYL and not quite sure how this works yet. I need support, and I don't know where to find it. I'm hoping someone can help.Here is a little bit of background. I am 19 years old, and a college freshman. I was partially hospitalized for an ED last spring. I also struggle with depression. A lot has happened since last spring, but I don't have the energy to type it all out.ÊRight now I feel stuck and hopeless. I wish i had hope- i used to. The longer I have been in recovery, the less hope I've had. I'm lonely and scared. Day after day after day I make the right choices... I eat enough, I tell myself things will get better... I just don't know how much longer i can do it. I feel miserable. My depression tells me awful lies, and my ED is the only coping mechanism i have found to help with the depression. Do i just keep pushing through the ED temptations and depression every day even though I feel miserable? At what point do I stop? I am afraid to ask for help. I think if i were truely honest with my therapist/psychiatrist/parents, they would tell me to rethink my plans for my future. I've thought about dropping out of college and going into an IOP program, but i feel like it would be worthless and I would never get better. My GPA is a 4.0 and i'm finally starting to make friends at school... I would hate for my depression/ED to take that away from me.
