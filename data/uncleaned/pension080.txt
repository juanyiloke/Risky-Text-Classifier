"Healthy Start Food Vouchers"Wasn't aware of this one until this morning.  Called at my local shop to get my morning paper and saw a sign in the window "Milk Vouchers accepted here".  On querying this of the friendly shopkeeper, he replied "Healthy Start scheme innit?"  Evidently weekly food vouchers can be claimed for milk, plain fresh and frozen fruit and veg and infant "formula" (another Americanism) milk.  Under 18 and pregnant you get these anyway but the criterion for claiming otherwise is 10 weeks pregnant or have a child under 4 and you or your family get the various Income Support and jobseeker allowances providing your income is less than £16, 190 p.a.  Agreed 'er indoors received a free tin of National Dried Milk weekly together with a bottle of orange juice when our family were nippers but the costs of that surely pale into insignificance when the cost of this present day voucher scheme must be taken into account?  Pity that the same benefit is not available to OAPs!
