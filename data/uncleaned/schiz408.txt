ÊEverything is great but yet I am struggling to cope with schizophreniaI should be really happy because I have no worries in life. Yes I am a little in debt but its manageble. My wife is due to give birth to our 4 son in august so again that is something to be happy about. I really can't cope with the running comentary in my head I have just had my haldol depot increaed to 300mg per month yet it is not touching the commentary. I hear voices coming from the extractor fan in the bathroom telling me that they are going to kill the baby and that I am evil and work for the devil. Most of the time I can fight the voices as my insight is very good but I am getting tired of fighting and I think I may be deppressed. My voices constantly say that I am evil and I should end my life. I am on 150mg of sertraline to try and help with these thoughts but it like the haldol is not working.I am seeing my c.p.n tomorrow but we are running out of options as I have tried everything else apart from e.c.t which i would not mind trying If I thought it would work. Why o why do I feel shitty when I should be excited and happy.Sorry for the ramble
