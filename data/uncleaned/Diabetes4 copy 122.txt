AngiogramI saw one of my GP's today and like me was thrilled with my normal result from my angiogram, I did ask whaT is causing the S.O.B ( diagnosed over 15 years ago with mild asthma, haD one failed test earlier this year and as I was a bit upset about it had another with an inhaler to open the airways just before the test on which I passed with great difficulty, my GP pointed at my stomach, i have a huge hernia and explained this and stated I do watch what I eat she said no you must eat smaller meals I do childrens size or no bigger than the palm of my hand I also have osteoporosis but it has just changed back to osteoperinea due to three IV infusions over a three year period which I am elated about plus I am sure the pump is helping too, alas i was qUite upset about this saying my size is causing my S.O.B WHEN I try to get my weight down I am 12st. I do have an underaCtive thyroid. alas at 66 I am still working and I get tired exersize i s my downfall.
