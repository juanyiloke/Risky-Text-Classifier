Referal How long do they normally take? Hi EveryoneI've had problems with poorly controlled asthma for 3 years. Until recently my GP and I have been happy to add and fiddle around with meds, but we have run out of things to try and as I frequently end up on stetoids with two longish courses in the last 6 months we thought it was time for a referal to the respiratryclinic at the hospital. After 6 weeks of not hearing anything from the hospital I chased up the referal with my surgery who then chased up the hospital. Three weeks later I get a letter saying that there is a 20 week waiting list for appointments. This leaves me over 6 months between the initial referal and the first appointment. It seems rather a long time to wait with nothing to try in the meantime.What are other peoples experiences with referals and how long you've had to wait?I had referal and consultant when I was 14/15, but that was 20 years ago so don't really remember.Should I ask my GP if he can hurry it up (can they do that?) as at the rate I'm going I'll have another two 6-8 week courses and three short courses of steroids before I see a consultant and would obviously like to limit that.Sorry for the waffle and thanks in advance for any replies. Fran
