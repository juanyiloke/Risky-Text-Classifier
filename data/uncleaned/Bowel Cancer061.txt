Living lifeSo i had my second chemo today. And still feeling positive. I know I'm losing weight but its a challenge I am willing to face. While I've been hanging on the couch with my guy tonight I was looking through some pics over the last year. The year before we found out about the cancer. It really seems like so long ago. What got me thinking about all of it was our trip to a little mediterranean restaurant down the street. We live in a big college town (University of Kentucky) and it is great for hole in the wall restaurants. It is one thing i will miss when we move to the country next week but its a short drive away so it will be worth it to be in the open and fresh air. Anyways back to the restaurant; it had some really great photos on the walls of a few places in Jordan and they were some of the exact places we were at last year. My partner and I are both in the military and spent last year deployed to Jordan/Kuwait/Afghanistan training the Jordanian military. It was a long and stressful year in part to the work and in part to the symptoms i was having. I ignored them because i figured it was lack of sleep, poor diet and high stress. However the experiences we had were amazing and I am so grateful now that we had them. It was an amazing land to see the baptism site of Jesus and to stand atop a mountain looking into jerusalem and Isreal. Even across the sea of galilee and all the history that had taken place.I share because i am so blessed with my experiences both good and bad. I love serving my country and this cancer and treatment has taught me to love what we have and live every day to the fullest. This forum has helped me so much in the short time i have been part of you. I know i am on the other side of the ocean but it has been an amazing community with caring and supportive people.Thank you all and please enjoy the pics. Tomorrow will be a great day and hugs to every one out there.Shan
