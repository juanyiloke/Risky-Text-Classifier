ÊEscape binge eatingHi!ÊSo binge eating is not something really talked about a lot where I live since none of my therapists figured out I was binge eating and when I talked to them about it they didn't pay that much attention like it was no big deal. So none of them were able to help me with that issue and since I'm living with my parents, I can't escape the chips and deserts. I can't escape it and lately I can't control myself and it makes me so miserable. Really any tips are welcome anything that could help me is so appreciated!
