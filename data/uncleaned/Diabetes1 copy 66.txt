What's the best way to give yourself an insulin shot?I must be doing something very wrong, because I have really bad scar tissue around my (squishy) abdomen. I've been giving myself insulin injections for as long as I can remember; I always find a nice squishy spot (and plenty of it!), pinch it up and ram that needle in at a 90-degree angle. I guess when you've been doing it as long as I have, you're bound to have some scar tissue, but the insulin won't get absorbed as good if you inject it into scarred tissue. What am I doing wrong? Anyone have any pointers? Thanks!
