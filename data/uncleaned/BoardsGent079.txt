Flyaway hairsRight lads, for the last few years I have had flyaway hairs, badly. It seemed to occur for no particular reason.No matter if my hair is dry, or wet straight from the shower, I have loads of these little annoying hairs that stick out from the main bulk of my hair.ÊI have tried leaving it air dry, drying it completely straight away, using shampoo less, using some types of serums, conditioners, etc, etc.My hair used always suffer from this if I had came out of the shower or swimming pool and left my hair air dry but now it happens no matter what, even using wax, clay, gel doesnt seem to fix the issue although it does make a big difference.Has anyone here found a way to solve this?
