Feeling guilty and unworthyHello Everyone,I'm suffering from Binge Eating Disorder. What I very often feel is feeling of being guilty. Not only after eating too much, eating sweets but also after doing something for myself, being "good" for myself. I feel like I do not deserve anything in life...absolutely anything.For instance, I have just came back from running. I love it and it really helps but then my mind told me : You should have learnt..not run!Another example : I often feel guilty when someone is very rude and mean for me, I'm looking for a problem in myself and blame myself. I can't understand why someone treated me without any respect and I often binged due to that.Please, tell me...Do you have the same/similar? Do you do everyday sth for yourself?Take care
