I have been co-sleeping with my second child since he was born. I dont particularly enjoy it but as I had a c section it was convenient for me after the birth to not have to move too much to get baby. Now my ds2 is coming up to 6 months I am contemplating moving him out of my bed in to the next room he will be sharing with my other ds (aged 2.5). Ds2 will be sleeping in a cot but I am not sure whether it is safe to move him in with the toddler. Ds1 is not violent or aggressive towards him and is actually quite caring to his brother. However he is 2.5 and i dont feel like I can trust him entirely. Plus dh feels its too soon for the baby to be in his own bed in the next room. I moved ds1 in to the next room when he was about 3 months (no co-sleeping he juat outgrew his mises basket) so ds2 has been sleeping with us for longer. What age is the right age to move baby in to their own room?
