can Glucophage change personality ?   HelloI hope my English is understandablealmost two weeks ago I was diagnosed with PCOS and the doctor gave me Glucophage and I started it right awayshe said that my hormones are normal .. but she tested me the last day of my period (the 8th day)right after I took Glucophage .. I noticed changes in my personalityI'm not intense as I used to be ... I take things more freelyI also feel sorry for everybody .. not really sorry but mercy? I don't know but I feel I want to help everybodymy sex drive also is upand some other changes tooand I don't feel like myself .. it feels weirdit feels like there is a differenceI'm wondering can it cause these changes?
