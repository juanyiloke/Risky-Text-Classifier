Diabetes - or just bad circulation?.   Hi - for the past few years I have had 'numb' feet. They feel really cold,but they don't feel cold to the touch if you see what I mean. The soles especially are numb and I don't have a great deal of feeling down there. I have been tested for diabetes twice,and have been well within the safe limits. I'm 55 years old,23 stone,smoke,drive a truck and don't get time for a vast amount of exercise other than walking the dogs. My GP can't believe I'm not diabetic!.Following a heart attack 11 years ago I am on: Aspirin,Omeprazole,Atenelol and Approvel. Plus I take Lecithin capsules daily instead of statins which I couldn't get on with. Cholesterol level was 4.5 when checked a few months ago. When I saw my GP about the numb feet a while ago,all he could say was that he has had numb feet for the past 30 years. Really helpful.Should I go back and be more persistent,or should I just leave it?.
