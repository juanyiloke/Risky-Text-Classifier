Retiring in an EU country and increasing spending power of your money 4 timesHello everyone. We have retired to Bulgaria and are interested if anyone else here might consider that. We have a lovely house in Bulgaria - a house we bought at the fraction of the price of a similar one in the UK. You would not believe how cheap houses are here.We enjoy the sunshine, wild and virgin nature and the magnificent views from our varanda.A pint of beer in a local pub is just 45p!!.One can have a check up at the doctors on the day that you ask for an appointment. If registered with the local NHS Ð something which you are entitled - free of charge.ÊApproximately 1000 is the number of the British people who live within a thirty mile radius of the area where we live, so we have plenty of expat friends and local Bulgarian friends.Look forward to your replys and please ask me any questions on the subject, nice to be part of the community.Simon
