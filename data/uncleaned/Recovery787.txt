 I'm glad I got helphi im jimgoose age 47 i am the youngest brother in my family.My Nanna Molly  was a part of the stolen gen along with her siblings.She was from  the yorta yorta people up near the nsw /vic border and was turned into a house maid.Nanna passed away when i was very young but my sister of 3 years older knew her very well. My cousin Jenny is an Aboriginal artist , has had a fair success with her paintings and knows my Nanna's story better than I.The rest of my ancestory comes from england wales Ireland etc.I have been thinking about ending my life for a long time and hid it from everybody well.I used self ending as an outlet for pressure as in if i went through with it id have no more worries.This gave me comfort until  about a year ago i started to plan  the act of suicide  down to the last detail.Finally i decided to tell my partner of  23 years about  my thoughts because i realised that i would be hurting others if i did it.My partner understood and told me i should get some help ,so i did and I feel a lot better. I still use ending it all as a cure for not coping with the pressures of life , but its like the doctor and cat team have wound the clock back a bit  thus giving me time.I also got medication which i don't like.Everything i did just seemed pointless and i felt like the entire world hated me and i was also a bit more delusional than normal.Im so glad i got help because i believe i may see my kids become responsible adults one day. This is my second post and i know im not alone here and i somehow feel like i belong again.
