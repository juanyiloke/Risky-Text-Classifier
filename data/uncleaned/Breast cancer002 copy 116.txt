How to cope?¥	My mum is a very active woman! She loves working, then coming home cooking, cleaning and gardening. She got diagnosed with TNBC. She knows it's kinda aggressive but she doesn't know much about it, because she hasn't been on the Internet and looked at Polish articles etc (she's polish) firstly idk how to tell her or if I should tell her about what I read online? I feel so bad, but it breaks my heart to tell her some of the stuff I've read! It was bad enough that I had to be the one to translate the words you have cancer, you have TNBC.¥	 ¥	however my feelings aside, my mum is the most important person that matters. During chemo I know for a fact she won't be able to work. She works long hours, 6am-8pm with few breaks in between. She works In 2 high  schools and an office. Oncologist said it would be for the best I she avoids working at the school especially if she's a cleaner because she can pick up infections. Which is fine and my mum is fine with that too. However, I know this will be hard for my mum considering how much she loves being on the move. What are your tips that I can tell her she can do, without risking her health too much? She should start T-FEC soon. I'm going to get some Opera tickets for her soon, she always wanted to go. I'm also tryi to convince her to go on a short holiday before chemo but I think she's too worried! I know I keep posting a lot, but it helps.
