Recommendations for clubs? Want to make some new friends!Hi there! It’s my first time posting in boards so be nice!  I was wondering if someone could help me! I’m a 20 year old Irish woman, am living in Dublin and would love to meet some new friends. I was thinking of joining a club, (or something like it) to meet new people. Only problem is, I’ve been trawling through Google and can’t seem to find anything.  I’m an active person, and I love art so anything art related/sport related would be appreciated, once its social!I’m a friendly person, I’ve just had a bit of bad luck with friends recently, so any help would really be appreciated!Thanks!!
