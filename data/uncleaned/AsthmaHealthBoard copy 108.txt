  New asthma diagnosis________________________________________Hi I have posted before on other boards. Mainly about my foot , ankle issues and arthritis. Now I am here on the Asthma board because I was recently diagnosed with asthma. Went in to see my Dr about a week and 1/2 ago because of a bad coughs that was keeping me from sleeping. Had been sick with bad cold about 10 days, and then this cough started. Don't usually go to Dr for a cold but I needed to sleep and over the counter cough meds were not helping. Within a couple minutes the Dr asked if I had ever been told I had asthma! Told her "no but had suspected it myself." I have had times during exercise, either working in garden or working out ,experienced SOB and or chest pain. Sometimems at end or hours later lying in bed. Even though I expected asthma I also thought it was due to being out of shape or somehow not a big deal. When my dr heard this along with knowing my history with allergies she said I had asthma. Prescribed cough med with codeine , Fliticasone nasal spray , a controller inhaler for x2 /day & albuterol inhaler for SOB or wheezing. I usually don't wheeze and in fact a friend once told me therefore I don't have asthma. I have sense learned that is not true. However had a very scary episode recently while in restroom of grocery. It was like I got caught in the middle of a cough and could not get my breath. I think I was wheezing. I am so new to this and trying to learn as much as I can. I truly believe I have had asthma for years. Luckily no emergencies! Now I have to learn to recognize symptoms instead of ignoring them. Like this annoying chest discomfort I have the last couple days. I also don't think I am using the inhalers correctly.Can't seem to breath in slowly. I want to breath in at the same rate as I push inhaler pump. Hopefully I get good with practice as I don't want to bother with a spacer. Ok This is too long so goodby and thank you all for this great educational support group.!
