Dropping out of Universityby BethanyLongI transferred University this year, I am in my second year and have just got my mark for the first essay that I have done on Medieval England [I am studying History] I did not even pass, I got 39 which is the worst mark I have ever received, I am mortified and uncontrollably upset as I put effort into the essay which my tutor commented on how much reading and work I had put in, though I changed the format as my tutor advised me to do it in themes rather than chronologically and I did not think it read well but submitted as it was her advice, yes there were some referencing errors but I feel completely disheartened and cannot see how I will pass university now with at least a 2:1. I am going to speak to someone about my options tomorrow but has anybody got any past experiences or advice ?
