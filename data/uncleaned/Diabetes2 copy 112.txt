gliclazide   i am writing about my husband, he was diagnosed type 2 about a year ago given metformin seemed to be doing well. then about 5 months ago locum gave him avandia, all hell broke loose terrible raised rash, skin breaking up on legs, swollen feet and ankles, and really weird memory and temper.we kept going back to gp no advice etc. after researching myself, i took him of avandia, after 8 days off his skin started to improve swelling reducing.now gp has put his on gliclazide, been on them about 8 days, just yesterday i noticed the raised rash has started up again.can anyone please tell me do these meds have the same contents as avandia please i dont think my sanity can take much more.
