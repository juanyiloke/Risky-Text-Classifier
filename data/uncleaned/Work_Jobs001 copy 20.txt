Deductions from final payslip________________________________________Hi,I finished up a job in Feb to start a new one.I gave my 4 weeks notice and worked it out.When I got my final payslip for Feb they had deducted my bonus for 2014 plus my pay increase for Jan and Feb. I have been on to them numerous times and they say they are going to refund me the difference in the salary increase but not the bonus. I haven't given my P45 to new employers yet as I want the old one to sort out the pay.As my calls and emails are not been returned I was thinking of filing a complaint through Workplace Relations. Has anybody used them? Do they charge and do they get results?
