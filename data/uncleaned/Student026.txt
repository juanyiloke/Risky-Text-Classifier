Should I do the third year?by ZyloI hate university. Having said that I kinda liked the first year, it's really this (the second year) which I have despised.I am lonely, depressed, have few friends, have self esteem issues, can't and don't socialise and due to all of that, I am left with no motivation, poor time management and thus will probably only scrape through this year (i'm doing law).I believe I managed at least a 2:2 in the first year, but that does not count at all. This year I will probably get a 3rd or 2:2 at best The second year only counts for 30% though and I have, by now, paid £18,000 in tuition fees alone. Should I just try and ride out the final year and try to get a decent grade? If I were to do this, I'd do my dissertation over the summer meaning the 3rd year itself will be made considerably easier as I'd only have to "improve" my already written dissy leaving plenty of time for other coursework and exams. My main reason for forcing myself through another painful year is because if I leave now, so much money has gone to waste. But it's worth noting that I will never be a lawyer, I'm too shy and lack confidence for it. Though of course I could do other things with a Law degree.Thoughts?
