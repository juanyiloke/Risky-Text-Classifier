Chef With Complex Ptsd In Northern VermontI am a 42 year old chef with Complex PTSD from an emotionally and psychologically abusive relationship.Travel has always been something that I have loved to do. I've lived in a lot of places, most recently spent a few years in Central America with my wife (abuser) and our son. Nineteen months ago I went to visit my father before he passed. When I returned my son said, "Now I know the truth." He has not wanted to see or speak to me since.What truth? Everything was good between us before.Six months ago she abducted our son. I have not seen or heard him on the phone since.Oh, and my wife is legally disabled with full SSDI for bipolar 1 which I believe was misdiagnosed. Borderline Personality Disorder is what I think she has. She is a sociopath. It is my son's therapist who used those words.I had not been able to find/ keep a job in four years prior to finding work at an ibogaine treatment clinic. In exchange for treatment and $200/week I worked 60 hour weeks for nearly six months. There are things I can do and things that I can not do. Cooking is therapeutic.Coming back to Vermont I stumbled into a great opportunity based solely on my pre-PTSD reputation. I've been handed a beautiful restaurant with no rent or mortgage to pay for six months. The property owner knows the situation and is still willing to take a gamble on me.I've also been offered a book deal with a proposed first run of 600,000 copies, just need to write a few recipes. A nutritionist will write the content. My career has never looked better, and I feel stuck.Would love to meet somebody else in Northern Vermont who understand what it is like to live and try to work with PTSD.
