Is my asthma down to recent pollution levels?  27  Hi everyoneI've suffered from asthma and hayfever since I was a baby (I'm in my fifties now) but over the last few years the asthma had virtually dissapeared, until a couple of weeks ago.  A number of people have commeneted on me sounding out of breath and I'm having to use my ventolin sevaral times a day.  I was wondering if it might be down to the high polluion levels we've been hearing about in the news?  I hope it settles down soon as I have lots of other problems to deal with and don't this as well!Any comments gratefully recived as I'm quite inexperienced in dealing with asthma having been free of it for so long
