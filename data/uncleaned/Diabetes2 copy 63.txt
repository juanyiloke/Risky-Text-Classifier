Do I have diabetes?! How to convince doctor to test me!   Hi, so for a while now i've had these symptoms..*increased thirst (i drink up to like 9 litres of water a day and am still thirsty!!)All of these are linked with type one diabetes, however a while ago I was tested, (about 9 months ago now) for another disease called addisons and at the time the doctor told me i was definitely not diabetic. However my symptoms are getting worse, to the point I am so tired my university studies are being effected. What I wanted to know really was did anyone experience the same, and how long did it take for you to be diagnosed? Also how were you diagnosed/ how did you get the doctor to listen/take you seriously!! I am 20 years old, and exercise 5 times a week so should be at the peak of my physical fitness yet am still feeling awful! So any help would be greatly appreciated
