tired of being afraidby wheatthins » Wed Sep 03, 2014 2:04 amIm tired of the paranoia that someone is going to attack me or rape me. Im tired of living in fear. My counselor reassures me i can heal. But im tired of feeling like im in a mental hell. Its been awhile since i been here. So hello again btw. Its time to revisit. I recently made alot of changes in my life. Been dating an awesome man for a year and we are now engaged. We just moved to a new state and now i have a new job. I work for a non profit that serves the homeless community. Yet whenever im surrounded by men i feel fear of being raped. Also what i do not understand is so many faces look familar to me and i have never met them yet it freaks me out and triggers my anxiety. I am a survivor of sexual abuse by a man who was in a high position in the church. He threatened to kill me if i ever said anything. So this comes to surface alot. And i hate it. Having a hard time. I hate ptsd. I hate anxiety.
