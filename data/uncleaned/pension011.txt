Serious Question re. Bedroom TaxEarlier tonight I was asked a question about the bedroom tax.Ê Labour and I think some other parties have said they will abolish the bedroom tax which means that housing benefit will be restored to the amount the house costs up to a point.Ê So housing benefit will be increased for some council and HA tenants.Ê Does anyone know if this will also include those in privately rented property? Or is the proposed rental cap on private properties expected to cover this?Ê I have looked around but cannot find a direct answer?
