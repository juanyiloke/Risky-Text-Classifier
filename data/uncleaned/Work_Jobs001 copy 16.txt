Internal Role Application________________________________________A role came up within our company that I was slightly interested in it. After a discussion with the hiring manager I was encouraged by her to apply for the role but as an internal candidate was asked to submit a proposal rather than an updated CV. I did this 7 weeks ago and got no response despite being aware they have interviewed for the role. I sent an email saying I appreciated that I wasn't considered the right candidate for the role but I would like a reponse or some feedback. There is still nothing. I don't know if it makes any difference or not but I was asked to submit directly to her and not HR. Also I have reason to believe that some of my proposals have been implemented within the team since my proposal was submitted.Am I being unreasonable to expect a response or is this just the way it is now? I would be one of the longest serving members of staff in the business.Any one have any views on this?
