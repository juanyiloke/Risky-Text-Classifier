  ThanksI just wanted to say thanks to everyone who has supported me so far. Although I wasn't really suicidal, I didn't care if I would have suddenly died, and talking here has saved my life and is putting me back on track. I've been depressed for a really long time and it's been a roller coaster. Every time i felt I was getting better, I plummeted back down. I hit a really low point this past November when I joined, hence my username, and even though I continued to do every day activities, I was lifeless. I felt like a loser and like no one really cared about me except for my Mom. I'm still pretty lonely at college even though I have some friends, but they're not really people I can confide in. Talking and listening to everyone here has given me hope and gave me that extra push I needed to regain control of my life. I am truly grateful.
