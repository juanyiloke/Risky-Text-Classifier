Enzalutamide and Abiraterone    Hello,Please could you help me with any feedback concerning Circulating Tumour Cell blood tests? Has anyone had any of these tests on the NHS or privately? I am interested in finding some means of arranging a blood test that will identify the androgen receptor subtype known as AR-V7. Is anyone aware of any facility in the UK that offers this test?There has been recent publicity concerning a trial involving 31 men treated with Enzlutamide and 31 treated with Abiraterone. A CTC blood test identified those who were AR-V7 positive and those that were negative. The men who were AR-V7 positive had poorer PSA responses when treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone.I would also like to hear from anyone who has been turned down for Enzalutamide or Abiraterone treatment on the NHS (England) and whether it is possible to obtain these medicines privately. I understand that they are extremely expensive, but desperate times call for desperate measures.Thank you so much for any assistance that you may be able to provide during this very difficult time. I am very grateful.Best wishesNJ
