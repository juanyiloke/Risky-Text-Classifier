ÊGratefulness..... please joinSo I have been thinking about ways to bring some light to this often times overwhelmingly hard PTSD forum...we all struggle from time to time(an understatement from me)So.......Here at home when I put my boy to bed, the last thing we do before I love you's and sleep time is name at least 3 things each we are grateful for. His always make me smile and also feel proud that he sees these things in his life now.Frequently I struggle to name 3, but always do given enough time.I thought I'd share my 7 yr old boys(when he is with me) and mine from time to time. I'd love it if you felt you wanted to join in.
