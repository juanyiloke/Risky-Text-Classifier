I don't know why I am posting this I have been getting some very vague suicidal thoughts the past few weeks,  not a plan or anything just a general wish that I wasn't here any more.  I am tired, and tired of living and coping and not seeing anything I want to live for.   I feel like this in company or alone.I am still doing all the things I used to do but none of them bring me much pleasure any more.  I am not more depressed than usual,  i am quite buoyant and laugh and joke with the best of them but just have this feeling that I want to go and have peace from it all.I am 61 now and don't have anything nice to be here for like kids or family who really want me or understand.   I feel like my body is starting to shut down and I will just fade away in the end.  I don't have any plans but just a wish to be somewhere peaceful,  I am on ad's and have had counselling in the past and don't need advice to go see my dr.   I am just venting a bit (in a zombie type of way).   Is there an end in sight?   I hope so and soon.  x
