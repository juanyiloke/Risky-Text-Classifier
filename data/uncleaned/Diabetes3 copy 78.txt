UnwellStarted with a Coldsore early hours of yesterday & I do get them when I'm v run down. It's gotten worse & I woke up with awful pain in that side of my neck, face, ear & shoulder. Spoke to reception at drs as wasn't sure if they'd class it as a 'medical emergency' as that was all the appointments they had left so when I described my symptoms she made me an appointment at 4pm today with the same dr who diagnosed me last week. The surgery have been great. Wish I didn't feel ill & I don't know (coz it's a new condition) if it's a general infection/virus or more serious! But I will feel better getting checked out.
