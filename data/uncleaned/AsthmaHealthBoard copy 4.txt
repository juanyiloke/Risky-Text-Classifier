Acute Asthma and Anemia. Advice?________________________________________Hello all. Im a 24 male and have been suffering from some unusual symptoms for awhile. In October I developed severe unexplained Iron Deficiency (Iron-17, Ferritin- 2.7) and anemia along with diarrhea, repeated bronchitis, and renal insufficiency. I had high Eosinphil % (5-10%) in most bloodworks, along with High monocytes. Colonoscopy and full workup didn't show anything. Two days ago I developed a fever and wheezing. I went to my Campus Health Doctor today and he did a X-ray that showed thick walled bronchi. He said it was Asthma/Reactive Airway Disease bc of the eosinphils being high at 6.6%. This doesn't really make sense to me because I also have a fever thats ranging between 101-103 and other lab issuesRBC- low at 4.38 (the anemia was corrected months ago with Iron IVs and never caused a low RBC bc I had very high erythrpotein MCV- High at 95Lymphocytes low at 13.7% (19.5-50% range)Monocytes high at 9.8% (2-9% range)Does the Reactive Airway Disease/Asthma diagnosis make sense? I did have asthma as a child but it went into remission when I was 11 and hasn't bothered me at all since. I dont want to overact but the whole host of issues Ive been having has me concerned.
