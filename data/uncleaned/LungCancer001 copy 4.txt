diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer recntlyHello guys.This site seems to have a lot information regarding cancer in general ang lung cancer as well.As I stated above I was told by the pulmonologist and oncologist that I had lung cancer based on the biopsy result on my posterior rib at the back together with ct findings. This was march 23, 2015.Rib biopsy was adenocarcinoma. The onco told me it was stage 4 as I had right hilar and parahila mass as well as innumerable nodules in both lungs. There was also involvement of right posterior 5 to 6 ribs. No mets to liver spleen and pancreas and brain. Upper gi and colonoscopy were normal. Bone scan showed no distant metastasis apart from the rib involvement.Just had my first chemo this afternoon carboplatin amd pemetrexed. What do you think od the regimen? No aide effects yet aside from constant hiccups right now.I'm male 37 yo, nonsmoker, asian. My father had prostate ca and at least 2 sisters of his had cancer as well.
