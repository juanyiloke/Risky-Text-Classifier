Not sure what I should doI have type 2 and have been struggling for the last few months with not very helpful advice and information. I'm diet controlled at the moment. My BG was 6.5 to 6.8, when I first went on the expert course and I was doing well with diet and exercise. I was then told by my DN not to monitor as I was wasting my time and now I'm struggling. The winter and dark nights are  a bad time for me and I struggle with my diet and motivation. My BG is now 8.2 to 8.9. I had my review last Friday and came away feeling so low and worthless I just wanted to go under the duvet and stay there. The DN talks at you and I don't have a good relationship there as I rarely see the same nurse twice, which I find difficult. At my review the way the DN was speaking me was more like a threat as I was "clearly unable to manage my diabetes” and she was confusing me with all the carb levels. She never once asked how I was coping or if I was finding anything difficult, she just kept pointing at the monitor and saying numbers which made me even more confused and flustered. My husband has said to ignore them and start daily monitoring again. Since then I have looked at my books and I have started a food diary. Exercise is no problem as I have two dogs so most days is at least a 5 to 8k walk and I swim once a week and in the summer I love to garden.So since Saturday my BG has gone from 8.7 to 7.5 today. This after noon I got a call from the surgery to say I have to collect a prescription, which I did. It is for 500mg Metformin “one to be taken each day with breakfast and then increase dose as directed”. I am now really confused and surprised as to what to do as nothing was mentioned at the review and I don’t know anything about increasing the dose or when or what to expect or if I should take it. Especially was now my BG levels are coming down.Sorry for the long rant, but I feel I am just hitting my head against a brick wall .
