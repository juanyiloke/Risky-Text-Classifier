Panic Attacks or PTSD?by Raely » Wed May 07, 2014 8:35 pmI keep on dreaming about what he said to me. I already do have GA, and it's hard for me to trust people. Emotionally it's easier for me to shut down/self harm than actually deal with mental pain. He said horrible things to me, like "You're not the first person I've made commit suicide." He made me feel worthless, intentionally. He humiliated me in front of my friends. He told me, already suicidal, that he didn't care if I died or not. He made jabs at how I was sexually traumatized three times in my life. "It's like you want older men to take advantage of you." (All of my attackers have been older than me. Older cousin. Older friend. My ex is six years older than I am.) I constantly think of him. I'm afraid to sleep because I keep on having nightmares that involve him. He triggers a lot of panic attacks within me, and right now I can't breathe and I feel like crying. I've been trying to avoid feeling pain by feeling anger, but now the anger comes randomly, and full-force. he verbally abused me too many times for me to forget all the things he said.now the pain of it is almost as bad as how angry I am. I go to a psychologist for general stuff, like talking it out, but I haven't really addressed or solved or taken away any of my pain/anger.
