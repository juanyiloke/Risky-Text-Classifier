They are there but have very long waiting lists as each persons treatment takes a long time.I dont think I will ever be my old self, but hope that with time I can get better than I am now. Just typing this is &quot;therapy&quot;, lets all keep typing.When this started I didnt know what ptsd was about, and didnt know I had it, I feel lost, blame myself for having it, see people worse off than me getting on with things, yet cannot do so myself, that makes me feel weak, and guilty for seaking help. Luckily I am reciving it though, so go out there and get some yourselves, you cannot battle on your own forever.
