When its all finishes and the realisation hits you've had cancer!Ok so i was diagnosed in sept 2012 and by end of march 2013 had had all my treatment and surgeries.I never had that moment when your told you have cancer, just accepted it and wanted to know how to tackle it. Everyone says I have been really strong and positive all the way through. Although I did have moments whe there were tears. :'(But it's now nearly 2 months since my reversal it's all starting to hit home. The shock that I could have cancer and everything I've been through, all the tests, treatments, illness from side effects and the surgeries. Not to menion more or less 6 months off work.I'm trying to be positive about it all, as hey I survived unlike so many and have a positive prognosis, but I have moments when I just feel overwhelmed by it all and full of despair. It's hard trying to get back to 'normal'. I find myself bursting into tears at random moments and feel lost.I'm don't feel like I can talk about it to my husband or family as it seems like its all over and we should be getting back to normal life. And hey it's Emma she's a tough cookie she'll survive and just get on with it. :-\I know it's normal was just wondering how others got over it?
