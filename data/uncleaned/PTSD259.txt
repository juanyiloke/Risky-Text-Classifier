Do I have PTSD?by Waldy565 » Wed Jul 02, 2014 1:54 pmI don't know, it may be regular old depression, but I'm finally seeing the doctor on monday so will be good to be finally sorted - anyway, it kinda occured as I was on a walk today - I'm 18 in a couple of days, and I'm really stressed out about gifts and stuff as I feel guilty, and while this might be a leap (and this is what I want help with) teachers and students back at school, both primary and secondary (or kindergarten and middle school, re-taking a year of high school essentially - sorry, from England haha) pretty much put me down as an under achiever, making me feel, psychologically, scum of the streets. Therefore getting gifts and stuff feels as if I'm still an underachiever, I can't stand on my own two feet and I'll never be independent. Add into this I was bullied both primary and secondary for god knows what, there's a reason i suffer daily - it's people in general. I thought maybe it was just a social disorder but, does this sound too far-fetched? Also to add to this possibility of PTSD, daddy-o died from a head trauma. I've had suicidal thoughs and as I have friends with bipolar and depression I thought I was the same, but maybe it is PTSD. This sound about right?
