OK this is my last shot, I've posted on other topics as well hoping to find an answer as to what is happening to me. I'm now 21 years old, and this issue is something that happened ages ago. It happened from age 6 to about age 11 or 12. I never came forward with this issue until now, and I don't know why it suddenly came up now. within the last month I had my first flashback (which I had lots of as a child but then they stopped) I recognized the feeling immediately because you can't mistake it. I didnt know what it was, but now I know its a flashback. I've had only a couple more and then several more "milder ones" My main trigger is waking up startled from sleep, but these milder ones are strange, they're somehow connected to a feeling in my mouth. I never had them in public until now, but like I said they are milder. I also have issues with sleeping and eating and lost like 15 pounds since that first flashback in the last month. I also lost my motivation, it is what caused me to go to the sexual assault center, because I'm in university and am close to failing. It was super scary to go in, and I still haven't given any details besides age, and that it was family because for some reason I get too scared. My other major concern that made me go to the sexual assault center is that I'm completely numb. Never have I been someone who can't cry, and now I just feel cut-off from emotions like sadness and it drives me crazy. I still feel lots of anger though, and I think this is just frustration with being confused and not knowing how I feel. I want to open up more about the details and I don't understand what holds me back about talking about them, maybe because I don't know how I feel about telling the details? This is the only way I can get better, I want to understand whats going on so that I can talk about it and get better. I hope someone might have some answers
