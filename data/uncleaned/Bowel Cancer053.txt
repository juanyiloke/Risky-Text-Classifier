Does anyone ever "choose" to keep the bag?I know it sounds crazy...as much as I dislike having the colostomy, I really don't have any trouble with it, and I manage it quite easily now. I was really blocked up by the tumour, so it's improved my quality of life a lot to be honest.I had a booking made for my bowel resection yesterday, which will take place on July 8th. Because I have a lot of other procedures to go through (two liver resections and lots of chemo as well), the surgeon said that a colostomy reversal would be 12 to 18 months away, which is fine, I have no issues with that. He gave me a totally reversible colostomy when he had to fit one due to my bowel obstructing, and I was happy with that of course.But, yesterday when he was going over the procedure, he was explaining that because he has to remove my rectum I am going to have a year or so of serious issues with going to the toilet. He said liquid motions, rushing to the toilet many times a day, never being able to be far from a toilet, maybe "accidents" due to lack of control. He said people generally reach some sort of peace with the situation after about 12 months, and the bowel learns to make more solid motions etc.I didn't like the sound of it one bit to be honest....I was thinking to myself gee, maybe I could just keep the bag. I was trying to put this thought out of my head, when my husband said "why wouldn't you just keep the bag, I don't care, and that sounds terrible, what he just described". The surgeon looked astounded, that anyone would ever consider such a thing, but quality of life is pretty important to me at the moment...especially being stage 4, you never really know how much time you have, and it's important to me that it's good time, not rushing to the toilet, worrying about poo'ing myself etc, gosh how awful that would be.Thoughts? Would it be SO crazy?
