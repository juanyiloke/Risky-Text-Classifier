Pale ShamingI came across this YouTube video earlier and thought there was some really relevant points raised in it:Having skin type 1 that doesn't tan I regularly get comments on how pale I am. These comments are generally not flattering. I would rarely go out without fake tan on especially if I'm wearing an outfit that shows off my legs. I feel sad that I am not comfortable enough with my own skin tone that I have to mask it in fake tan constantly. Just wondering what other boardies feel about this and do they agree with video?
