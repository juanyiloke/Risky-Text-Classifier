Strategies for coping wantedHello,I am new to beyond blue and would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has strategies for coping with anxiety and depression.I have been off work for over 8 weeks since being diagnosed by my GP and Phscologist. I am feeling lonely, constantly seeking reassurance and questioning myself.My current time off consists of  exercising - jogging, swimming / sauna / spa and seeking massages as needed to relieve stressfull thoughts.Relaxation tapes as a form of meditation help but unfortunately I am constanlty still anxious and frustrated with my progress.My GP has recommended I continue with exercise as well as taking natural medicine - (St Johns Wart) and provided me with a medical plan to vist a Physcologist every second week.I am considering asking my GP to prescribe anti depressant medication as I have not seen a lot of improvement in the 8 weeks since my diagnosis.Any feedback as to what else I should do will be greatly appreciated.Regards,Tiger 14
