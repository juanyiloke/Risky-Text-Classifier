How do you stop feeling fat and disgustingHi well I'm 22 and have the problem of feeling fat constantly... I'm always being told that I've lost loads of weight but I still feel the same weight and feel like I look the same weight every time I look in the mirror I starting this being sick all the time after I ate... After my boyfriend would call me fat constantly and that's what has triggered it off now every time I look in the mirror I just feel fat and disgusting .. And when I eat anything I feel fat and that's when I go back to the toilet and make myself sick again ? Just wondering does this feeling fat thing ever go I don't wanna damage my body ... But it depresses me to constantly feel this about myself every day
