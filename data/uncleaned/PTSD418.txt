Êdeep-seeded guilt/ptsdI was molested for 14 years.I don't really know if that's why but I have a deep-seeded sense of guilt and shame.I don't really know where the guilt comes from. but part of my brain tells me it is do to mistakes I have made. Small ones. just hundreds of mistakes.. part of my brain that i don't follow that tell me to do this or that.at first i tried hard to follow the thoughts. but they just never went away and if i didn't follow them exactly to the tee, i would get punished by the sounds and people surrounding me because they could read my mind and know the things i don't do.anyway recently i had a dream that a group of my old teenage friends went to the molesters home with me and became violent with him. in the dream i was crying in the corner, and they were calling me a baby and spoiled.. and to stop crying. in the dream the attempted murder and i think he might have died.anyway that was just a dream as far as i know. but i still have deep regret about it. because when i think about that situation as though it was reality, i don't feel like i am supposed to.i feel in shock and like a bad person. but i don't want to cry. and i wonder if i have a lack of remorse and am being punished karmicaly for that?i have suffered most of my life and i wonder if i should ever even try to feel better because maybe i did something terrible in a past life and am meant to feel this way? how could i know? how do i know when to give myself a second chance in life and try to heal?
