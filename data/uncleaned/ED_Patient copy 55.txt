Bulimia and MedicationI've been bulimic for about fifteen years.  I also have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder for which I am prescribed medication (sertraline, Lithium, aripiprazole and a depixol depot injection).  I've never found the medication to be of any help.  Could this be because of the constant purging?  I probably vomit within an hour of taking the meds.  Does that give them enough time to enter my blood stream or am I getting them out of my body before they have a chance to do any good?  My psychiatrist has commented on my erratic lithium levels (it often comes back low) and I wonder if this could be a reason.  Is there any point in taking the pills if I'm going to vomit them up anyway?
