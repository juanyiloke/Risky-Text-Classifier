I was sexually and physically abused as a child by one of my closest friends at the time. I still don't remember a lot of what happened and didn't remember any of it until the flashbacks started years later. Ever since, I've had severe trust issues--especially when it comes to men. I experimented with my sexuality but found that I could not be a lesbian. I'm now 21 and have never been in a relationship or even really dated. The very idea scares me to the point of having panic attacks, but I feel like I need to get into the dating thing so I can move on with my life and have the future I always wanted. I joined a dating site about a month ago and finally got the courage to meet one of the guys I had been talking to this last Sunday. He is a really sweet guy who is trying hard to understand my needs and fears. I got up the courage to kiss him and he wanted to get more passionate and panic set in. Horrible feelings were brought back and I wanted to be able to not be the girl who freaks out at everything. Even if things don't work out with him, I need to be able to get to a point where I can trust and eventually be intimate with a man. The fear is almost paralyzing. I don't know what to do.
