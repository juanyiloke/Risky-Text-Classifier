I was just on the phone with my mom talking about my PTSD. I was physically abused a couple of times as a child and TONS of emotional abuse, both from my dad. Whenever I talk to my dad, even on the phone like tonight, it causes night upon night of nightmares and sometimes panic attacks. I told this to my mom who raised her voice at me and told me to "not be ridiculous". She says she doesn't think I have PTSD, even though I match the symptoms of the disorder and was formally and professionally diagnosed with a mental health provider. She said I wasn't even beat that much. True, but one or two times has left scars that will last a lifetime and the YEARS of emotional abuse did even more damage. I can't be around my dad, much less even talk to him in person or on the phone. I talked to him on the phone tonight and so I told my mom that I was going to end up having night upon night of nightmares now and she just tells me to not be ridiculous. I CAN'T HELP HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES. WHY WOULD I CHOOSE TO HAVE THESE NIGHTMARES?? I HATE BEING LIKE THIS. WHY WOULD ANY SANE PERSON CHOSE TO LIVE A LIFE LIKE THIS, PLUS SUFFER FROM OCD, PANIC DISORDER, AND GENERAL ANXIETY? I don't get it. No one listens except for my therapist. It's depressing. I'm out of Xanax to help with this anxiety, so I thought I'd look for a web site to post my feelings on and came across this place. My life is depressing. I actually took offense to the response of her raising her voice and telling me to "not be ridiculous". Isn't a mom supposed to be a support person? I'm in my 20s, BTW. -Anonymous
