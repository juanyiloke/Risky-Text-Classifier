Diabetic Neuropathy, Legs giving way randomly  11  Hi all,I'm hoping someone can help me.I'm a type 1 diabetic, Insulin dependent and currently taking meds for what the docs and specialists are saying is Diabetic Neuropathy, over the last few weeks i am finding that my legs are worsening and i'm experiencing more falls, i've just had to be helped up from the bottom of the stairs by my partner after yet another fall however this time my knee completely went, now i cannot bend the knee and have a lump to the right side of the right knee which i'm guessing is off the fall, however after sitting down back in my chair i am experiencing randomly occuring spasms in my right thigh and it is extremely tender to touch, I have for a while suffered with cramps in my Thigh and Calf on both sides of my legs however its usually worse in the left leg than the right but these last few days my right leg is becoming more frequent and my falls are occuring a lot more often, I've had mobility aids fitted around my premises to help with the stairs and using the bathroom and have a bottle (which i don't like to use) however i was wondering if anyone had any further information as to this or could shed some light as to the progression of this disorder. I'm a 30 year old male and currently taking Etoricoxib, Tramadol Hydrochloride, Gabapentin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Oral Morphine as well as my insulin (high levels due to resistance) levothyroxine, simvastatin and a nasal spray for migraines (sumatriptin i think) Thanks in advance for your help with this and i'm hoping someone can shed some light as its getting worse and the doctors and specialists just keep saying its the neuropathy and we cannot do anything else.Dan
