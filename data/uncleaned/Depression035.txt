I know i should talk and take my meds, but something is stopping me... SORRY ABOUT THE LONG POST...ÊI have suffered from depression for years (many without knowing it). I grew up in a household where my mum was abused by my stepdad - he never touched any of the kids - and so i saw a lot of disturbing things. I then managed to get trapped in a similar relationship which led me to try to kill myself at 16 and I have never really spoken about any of it.I have moved on now and I am in a lovely relationship with a guy who understands everything and knows my mood swings aren't really me, but my depression and anxiety.I have never really dealt with any of the issues, just sucked it up and marched forward, but it has become more and more unbearable. I am now 23 and in my final year of uni, everything is getting on top of me. I have been to the doctors (finally) after my partner pretty much dragged me there, and i have been put on citalopram as well as referred to counselling.It was all going well for about a month, things started looking up and everything was great. I don't know what changed but I've stopped taking my meds and turning up to counselling and can't bring myself to make another doctors appointment. It's causing strain on my uni work and relationships with everyone and often just shut myself in my room with netflix and a lot of munchies...I know it is probably my anxiety, but i just don't know where to go from here... anyone got any ideas on what i can do to get back on track? I need to sort my life out once and for all, I don't want to go back to how i used to be.
