Manager receiving all of my work emails________________________________________Hi wondering if someone could help, 2yrs ago I went on maternity leave, the Manger who took over my role took my laptop, on my mails, I set up that she would get any mails while I was gone from our clients/customers. Last year I came back from maternity leave, got a new laptop, got my mails back up and working with, I have found out today by accident by seeing it with my own eyes, she is getting all of my mails still, I have gotten my mails checked and nothing is showing up that indicates she is getting them, however she is and I'm back 13 months. How do I go about approaching this and who should I go too? This girl has gotten a promotion since I've come back which now makes her my manager!!
