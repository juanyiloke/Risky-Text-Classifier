Tired of thisHi I don't know how I can keep going on like this. Everyday is a struggle. I tell this to my pdoc and evrytime he offers a change to my meds. Yesterday he offered to take me off of everything or send me for ECT. It has been nearly a year of fighting and I don't know how I can do it anymore. I'm having horrible side efffects from my meds nausea being one of them. My hair is falling out in clumps and the Dr doesn't give a shit. I'm on Medicaid so my choice of Drs is very slim. I was once a fun loving person now I isolate myself in my house because I don't want to deal with people. I barely see my friends and only see my immediate family. They know the pain I am going through but are also fed up with my breakdowns. How do I carry on like this? It is springtime usually my favorite timeof year yet I dont even feel like going out.
