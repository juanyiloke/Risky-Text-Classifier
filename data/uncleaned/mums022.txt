I'm having trouble with my little girl and tummy time.She is 16 weeks old, and despite no tummy time, has brilliant head control, can sit in a gumbo seat without a wobble..Up until she was 5 weeks old she would sleep on my tummy, but refused any kind of tummy time awake, now she won't even lie on my tummy of Kean on my shoulder!.Two things are troubling me about this - She is getting a flat head at the back. Through the day I put her for naps on the side if I am watching her, and on the play mat I will tip her sideways for a play, but still no improvement on the flat head.- rolling onto her tummy and not being able to move back. When I put her in the cot at night with feet at the bottom of the cot, I wake up and her head is where her feet were. she loves to flip about and is almost at the point of going all the way over, and I'm worried she will just smother herself when she gets there. If she is on her tummy she will scream and scream with her face smushed into the surface,will not use her arms even if you position her and support her chest, she just flops her arms to the side and screams, will not tip her head to the side in the floor or surface. I've tried propping her up with tummy time toys, holding her up, lying facing her, lying next to her, slowly moving her from her side to her from, masaging cream on her back after baths while singing, everything results in angry screams. Not sure what to try next!Any suggestions?
