Adjuvant ChemotherapyGood Morning,I am a new member. Was diagnosed with NSCLC in april of 2014 and had a lobectomy of lower left lung on June 24. Had complications in that I developed a chylothorax and had to have a repeat surgery to repair the leak. All that is done now. My cancer is classified at IIA as the tumor is small but there was one lymph node in the lung involved; no median lymph node involvement. The doctors are now recommending adjuvant chemotherapy with an aggressive cycle of CISplatin combined with vinorelbine. The therapy would be 4 months with each monthly cycle consisting of two doses of CISplatin combined with vinorelbine interspersed with a single dose of vinorelbine. This seems to be very aggressive to me and I am not looking forward to having that stuff in my body - seems worse than the cancer. I am now NED and considered to be in "remission". I am trying to get my head around what to do. I am just recovering from the double thoracotomy (last surgery was done on July 15 and I was in hospital for 26 days consecutively) and would really like to have some "normal" for awhile but apparently the adjuvant therapy is time sensitive and should be started within three months of surgery. The increase in survival rate with this therapy is approximatley 8 to 10%.Has anyone gone through this and would like to share their experience / thoughts.Thanks,Susan
