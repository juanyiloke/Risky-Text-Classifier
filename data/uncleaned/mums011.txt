Now that Dd2 (8 months) is not happily sleeping loads of her own accord and can't sleep downstairs in Moses basket / carrycot, I'm trying to get her down for naps in her cot upstairs but finding it impossible with Dd1 (2.5) who doesn't get the concept and rampages around trying to prevent her dropping off / wake her up should she drift off (she's very loud and little one a very light sleeper). Have had to resort to feeding to sleep on the sofa and heading upstairs when she drifts off to try and deposit her in cot but is not ideal as don't want the food / sleep association to go on much longer, and the movement wakes her anyway. Don't feel I can leave dd1 downstairs for long for safety reasons... And she won't stay in her room even with toys out, that's what we tried this morning and she started ripping pages out of books and kept crashing in the door to see her sister. Have also tried leaving dd2 to cry it out a bit but she ends up falling over in the cot and banging her head. Help!!
