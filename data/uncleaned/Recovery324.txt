Never imagined I post in hereThere was a time- even a couple of years after I was diagnosed with depression- that I honestly didn't think it would ever get any better. I always thought I would feel anxious about everything, that things would always just get worse....... but I have proven myself wrong.Don't get me wrong I still have bad days, but they are few and far between now and that good definitely outweigh the bad.Even when I think back to this time last year (before we moved), I was getting into a right state when the postman came (I still don't really know why- I just always thought there would be bad news), whereas now I stand and have long conversations with the postie (I even know his name and we have a right laugh). I couldn't stand where we were living- it was falling apart and nothing ever got done, so subsequently that made me feel worse. I also used to dread the house inspections, which would make me physically ill with worry. Shoot forward to now and I have absolutely no issues about the home inspections (I even ask if they would like a beverage ). I am also on really friendly terms with our landlords too- they are absolutely fantastic.My downfall is still the loss of my Grandad (his death is what eventually pushed me over the edge as it were), but I am learning to cope and how to deal. It is not something that I will ever get over and I still miss him terribly, but I am trying to find other ways to channel my emotion etc.Anyway, I just wanted to give everyone a bit of an update on me, as well as letting people know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. It may not be easy to see- Lord knows I never thought I would find it- but it is there somewhere. xxxxxxx
