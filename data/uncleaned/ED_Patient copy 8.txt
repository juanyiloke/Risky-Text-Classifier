recovering from anorexiaIm 16 and ive been recovering from anorexia since about 10/11 months ago, bit I had my school prom a few days ago and things have started getting alot worse since then, it made me feel worse about myself and i already hate every inch of myself, I've been hardly eating and just wanting to lose weight all over again and get back to about 6 stone I'm struggling with food really bad and its just so much stress and anorexia has ruined my GCSES, and is putting a strain on my relationship with my bf, but I just want to get back to a normal person where eating food isn't a chour   is there any way I can recover quickly cuz everything's just gone back down hill...
