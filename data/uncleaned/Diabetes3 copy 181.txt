Weird pump experienceJust had a 2 day break in Cornwall, very nice, quiet, decent weather but had a strange one with my pump! My pump alarmed whilst out walking in Port Isaac, Doc Martin was not about! The alarm was a result of a low battery, normally in my experience you have 24 hours plus remaining of battery life but on this occasion it was instant! I drove back to our hotel as I had a spare battery in my emergency kit. My problem was the screw locking cap device needed the special tool.....I use a penny piece sometimes, this time to no avail, the slot had messed up, i finally dug it out with a knife! Lesson learned, every time I change the battery I should change the screw cap!
