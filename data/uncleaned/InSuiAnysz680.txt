.. But I don't have even a little courage to go through with it, even though I think about it nearly every day.ÊI remember it started around when I was ten. At first it was mere suicidal ideation, and I pondered what would happen if I were to die? Who would notice, who would care? It gradually, throughout the years, intensified. I would think about different ways of dying, how I would personally do it, and when and why I should finally do myself in. I would experiment with "pain play" and try to remind myself that physical pain is simply a temporary response that precedes great change.ÊI've never amounted to anything in my life. My parents are strict and never let me do the simple things that everybody else gets to do, like hang out with a friend from school, go to a party, go on a date.. Because they wanted to "protect me". As a result, I've barely developed any social skills. But what hurts the most is that I'll never have any memories of simply being a teenager. For some reason, as a child, I always thought being a teenager would be fun.ÊSo now I'm going to college soon, where I'll finally have freedom, but I won't know what to do..ÊI feel like I was born a faulty human being. Everyone else seems to be happy, with great friends, and they can do things they like to do.ÊBut here I am, the girl with borderline personality disorder, quietly awaiting her death as usual, always looking through alt.suicide.holiday archives(an old community for the suicidal) and lurking the newer boards..ÊWatching everyone be so happy and enjoy their life, looking through an impenetrable glass wall.ÊI don't mind dying from a casual drug overdose, eventually. Life has never given me much to offer in the first place.Ê
