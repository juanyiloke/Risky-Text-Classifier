Hi been seeing a guy for a few months who has PTSD as a consequence of a long period in the fire service. He is also a recovering alcoholic who attends AA regularly and hasn't drunk for a couple of years. Just recently, we have had a number of arguments which start because of very minor things such as me suggesting changes to plans (not implementing them but suggesting only) and the last major one started because I commented that I was too hot (it was 35 degrees and we were in a stuffy hotel room with no aircon!). I am completely in the dark in understanding how such minor things spiral into major arguments when I am not an argumentative person and he always comes over as very calm. When we have argued, I am left feeling unhappy and understandably I tend to be a little quiet. He behaves as if nothing has happened and accuses me of being sulky because I'm quiet. I'm really worried about his behaviour and it's making me increasingly unhappy. I don't want to walk away from him, especially if it's PTSD related and something which we could work on. He doesn't like talkingabout anything related to drink or PTSD so talking to him isn't going to work and will probably end up in another argument. Has anyone got experience of anything similar or advice on what to do? Thanks
