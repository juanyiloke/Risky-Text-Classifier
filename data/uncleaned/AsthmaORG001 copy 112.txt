Why are asthmatics not believed? Why do so many people including general public, paramedics, nurses, gps, doctors, and non respiratory consultants think asthma is just like a panic attack. They always say if you calm down your breathing will be fine. Or they sit there saying breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out. What do you think I am trying to do? Do they think we are stupid? I cannot breathe out I am an asthmatic. There is air (or gas) trapped inside my lungs as I am having an asthma attack (ie airways have narrowed). Why is there so much disbelief as to whether a person has asthma? Why is it not being seen as a life threatening or life limiting condition? Why is there so little support? Asthma Attacks put pressure on muscles making people fatigued for several days after an attack. This is not laziness. Why is asthma seen like a fake illness to so many people in this world? Asthmatics have to fight to breathe yet they also have to fight to be believed! (disclaimer: I am breathing nicely and do not need a gp or medical attention)
