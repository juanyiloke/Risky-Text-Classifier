 Name callingI've called myself so many bad names on here, on my other site, to Sue and my friend. I've been told that I won't get a reply from Sue if I keep calling myself names and/or negative self talk. That makes me feel like shit. And my friend isn't texting back but I did write an apology PM to her. It's her birthday though . I feel like I'm taking up too much time of Sue and my friend's. I feel like I don't deserve help. I'm sorry for the way I've acted today...
