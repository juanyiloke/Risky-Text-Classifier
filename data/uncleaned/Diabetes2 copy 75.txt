Hypoglycemic?   Evening,I have been doing some research and think I may have this. After heavy drinking sessions I often feel fuzzy, lethargic, hot and shaky . I also notice an increase in my heart rate. I have it quite bad once where I felt like passing out, however the symptoms usually dissipate after eating or having sugar.Now I don't get this problem any other time than after a heavy drinking session, perhaps when I haven't eaten beforehand. This makes me think that it's not any diabetes. However, I will check with my GP. I understand that my weekend binge drinking is not healthy for me but such is my lifestyle.FYI I am a healthy 26 year old male in decent shape and exercise 3-4 times a week. Any help on this matter would be great.Craig
