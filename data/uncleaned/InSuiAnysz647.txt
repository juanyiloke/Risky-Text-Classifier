Something about me is unpleasant to others: my personality, my body, my face, my voice, my disposition; I don't know precisely; people just don't like me.ÊSo, I have no friends. I feel so sad when I see people together, talking, engaging, just being friendly to each other because I can never have that.If someone could offer me a cure: "hey, this is definitely what's wrong with you, and this is what you need to do to fix it" then I would be the happiest person in the world. But I have tried, year after year; positive-thinking, exercise regimes, meetup groups, meditation, study, psychologists ... I have followed these lines of advice earnestly, again and again, but repeatedly fail to solve the problem.ÊI don't drink, smoke or do drugs; I read, and play music; I'm not stupid, and I am very empathetic to other people and animals. I am not a sociopath by any definition. At least, this is how I view myself.... but the evidence given by the reactions of people to my being-present is contrary to this viewpoint of myself. So I am left asking myself: how can something so clear to other people remain so out-of-reach to me? This contradiction, upon realization, leaves me paralysed.A number of psychiatrists have stated that there is nothing wrong with me; one psychiatrist thinks I am looking for attention. But my heart thumps so tremendously with anxiety and loneliness.And, this problem is worsening with age.I now know that I am sick and there is no cure. So, I am ready now.I will sleep soon.
