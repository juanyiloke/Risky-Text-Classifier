Was it a real hypo?Woke at 3am feeling I needed the loo - but then came over really hot and perspiring to the point where it was dripping off me. My signal of a low (for me) hypo = usually very low 4s. Tested at 5.5!! Took 3 jelly babies and after about 15 minutes the sweats had gone and felt normal so settled down to sleep, This morning 8.30 felt fine tested at 4.1!!! NO SYMPTOMS. Certainly serves me right for not doing another test after 15 minutes. Bit horrifying to think how low I must have goneWhat is going on? I usually have very good awareness - feeling hot then a bit sweaty before the waterworks really start. Soon followed by tingly fingers which can make doing a test a bit difficult and then palpitations. So far have caught it for the past few months now at the very hot stage but this is the second night hypo where I have woken up hot in the last couple of weeks.The only thing I did differently last evening (about 6pm) was to spend about 3/4 hour strimming round the garden which did wear me out to the point of breathlessness and certainly did my back no favours so another task hubby will have to take on board. Somewhere on here I read that several members have experienced "funny" hyposhttps://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/was-it-a-real-hypo.52232/
