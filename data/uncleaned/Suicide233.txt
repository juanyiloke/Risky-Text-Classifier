No where else to turnI don't even know what to type here other than I finally feel like I have no where else to turn. I see nothing left for me in this life, I just want to die. I struggled with addiction for over 10 years. I finally got clean and have almost 6 months. I thought things would get better but they haven't. I wish I would have been left to die so many times but I always got saved. Please help me I want to die. I don't even have the energy to call a hotline. It would be so much easier if i could just get this pain to go away
