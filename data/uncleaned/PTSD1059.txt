I have been dealing with this for thirty years. In spite of medication and therapy, nothing has changed. I am constantly triggered. I am sick to death of it. I do not want to be me anymore. I cut myself this morning in an effort to deal with my feelings. One thing that really bothers me is nudity. In our culture, it is everywhere. I cannot escape it. I have one thing that really bothers me and that is when my husband views movies withnudity in them. He said he has stopped. Yet, he did it last night when I was out of town. He knows how incredibly important this is for me. I feel like my trust in him has vanished. I always counted on him for support. I just moved to a new state and my new doctor cannot see me for two months. I am on my own to cope with this til then. Just feel so alone and tired.
