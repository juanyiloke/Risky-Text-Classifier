At a CrossroadsI have an important decision to make, but I don't know what to do. I have struggled with the pendulum of binge/purge and restricting for years. Lately the binge/purge has decreased, but I have gotten more "dedicated" to restricting. I know mentally that going down that road doesn't end well, etc. But every time I think about giving it up I get defensive and scared. If I'm not totally cognizant of what I eat, I feel I will lose control and binge/purge, then I'll be overweight. Or I think I can't give it up because I haven't met my goal yet. What do I do? How do I get over this bump in the road and get out of this in-between stage? Deep down I do want to be free of this, it is consuming my thoughts and emotions constantly, but I am scared and it makes zero sense. I do go counseling and I feel I'm wasting her time because I flip flop. Help...
