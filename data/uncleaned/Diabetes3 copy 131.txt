Paying the price!I've just got home after going out for an amazing carvery I stupidly allowed myself 2 roast potatoes and a small dollop of mash Aside from that it was all good low carb food Turkey veg no Yorkshire. I resisted dessert - my favourite part of any meal And my bg now just over an hour later? 10  Just so angry that instead of chilling out I've now got to go out for a walk Hoping that will do the trick or no Lindt choc for me tonight  __________________Diagnosed type 2 in 2012 On metformin SR 500mg daily
