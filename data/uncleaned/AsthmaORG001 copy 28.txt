Breath sounds on auscultation Hey guys, I'm studying physiotherapy at uni and as part of our course we have to learn how to identify breath sounds through auscultation [using a stethoscope]... Today we were listening to people's chests and everyone found it really strange that I have what appears to be bronchial breath sounds over the apex of my lungs where you would normally hear vesicular breathing and my breathing was a lot louder than everyone elses.... anyone got any idea what this could be, or if it could just be a variation of normal... I have experienced quite a few chest infections that have mainly affected my left upper lobe [and this was the area where the breath sounds were the loudest].Thanks for any input.Jenni
