Bespoke SuitEvening gents,I'm getting a made to measure suit for my wedding this year, not really a suit wearer but said I'd splash out and treat myself as it will last me a long time.So I tried a few different tailors' shops in Dublin and the experience hasn't been great to be honest. The suit trade must be flying because most of them didn't call back after taking my details and saying they would, when the new swatches were in or when the tailor was back the next day, etc.Anyway, I decided on one after getting on well with the owner although the follow up service from his employee in the shop has left a lot to be desired. I selected a suit fabric, lining material, additional pocket, etc. and gave the goahead.ÊWhat has me a little confused is that he didn't take out a measuring tape once, just got me to try on a jacket and said "yep, you're about a 40 long" and that was it. Now I'd imagine when it arrives they'll do a few nips and tucks as required but I was kind of expecting him to get the tape out for neck, sleeve, outside leg, etc.Am I overthinking it or is this the normal procedure for a bespoke suit?
