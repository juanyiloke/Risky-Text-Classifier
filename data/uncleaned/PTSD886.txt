ÊPTSD/GAD/MDD/ADD help?I was diagnosed with having pretty bad ADD when I was a freshman in highschool. Around 5 years ago, I began having life-crippling panic attacks and was diagnosed with GAD/Panic disorder. Shortly after this diagnosis, I was diagnosed again but with having severe and recurrent major depressive disorder which I've actually suffered from for as long as I can remember... Anyway, I have recently suffered a series of traumatic events resulting in PTSD. I have been in CBT forever, and placed on more medications in the last few years than anyone should take in their entire life. As of now, I am taking Effexor XR 150mg daily, 20mg adderall twice daily, and vistaril as needed for anxiety. My doctor did not let me refill my seroquel I'd been taking for sleep for some reason, and put me on this vistaril instead of the klonopin I'd been taking before. At first, I felt okay. But now, my anxiety is through the roof, I no longer sleep through the night, I have horrific nightmares, and even some form of hallucinations....does anyone else suffer from these same conditions??? Or know effective treatment as far as medication goes???? Please help!!!!
