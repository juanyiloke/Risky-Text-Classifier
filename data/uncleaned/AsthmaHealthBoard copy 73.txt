Dry hacking cough that won't go away________________________________________Hey all,So, I have been fighting this dry hacking cough for six days now. No matter what I do, nothing works. I am exhausted from coughing most of the night. My asthma is mild for the most part, so am only on Flovent twice a day, and ventolin as needed. Whenever I use my inhalers it makes my cough worse and more productive, but I don't cough anything up. I did just get over a sinus infection about 2-3 weeks ago, but the cough I had with that went away, and this dry hacking one showed up. I have no other symptoms, but I have had two flare ups within the last couple of days. My chest hurts from all the coughing and I am losing my voice. Any ideas on how to put a stop to this? How long before I should go see a doctor? Any information would be greatly appreciated!
