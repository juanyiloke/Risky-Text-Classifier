Why Did You Choose The Course You Are Doing?by Shellshocker93I have been on the Internet and asking anyone I can regarding what course I am going to commit a substantial amount of money too and more importantly my time and commitment, I've been at this for numerous weeks, I keep changing my mind and worrying that I'll make the wrong choice. Something I enjoy, may have a niche for, but with considerable career prospects!Yet I see people choosing some very "generic" degrees which I don't wish to name to upset anyone  Well known to leave the graduate questioning their career prospects, with many of my graduate colleagues in the service industry, remaining firmly grounded where I used to work.So what was the reasoning behind you selecting your course? Are you enjoying it/regretting it?
