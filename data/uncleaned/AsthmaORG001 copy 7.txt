2 year old with asthma red cheeks Looking for a bit of advice. My son is 2 and has quite bad asthma, he has been admitted 3 times in 7 weeks. He currently takes seritide 125 and montelukast 4mg.He has an asthma plan but last attack didn't go through any zones straight from green to red, what I would like to know is last admittance all his usual signs were there dark eyes, cold, persistant cough, grunting and stomach working hard and the new one...red cheeks. Tonight he is sitting here seeming to be well but 2 cheeks are bright red again, not hot to the touch, not sun burn or teething but exact same as last week when asthma got bad gave him a little calpol and anti histamin 30 mins ago. Does anyone know if this is another sign as it has only just showed in last attack which was the worst. I am going to speak to his asthma nurse tomorrow just thought id ask. Thanks in advanceEileen
