ÊCBT assessment appointment.Tuesday morning I have an assessment appointment with a local short-term CBT service. I'm really hopeful that this could be a positive step forwards in learning to manage things better.ÊI'm also nervous though; I've been referred to them because mostly what I struggle with is low mood, so it makes sense because they primarily deal with depression and anxiety. But I have a feeling that they don't generally deal with PDs, so I'm a bit worried it isn't going to work out. I've moved recently, and where I used to live there was literally no help available for people with a PD diagnosis. I'm just really really hoping that that isn't going to happen here!I know I just need to go and find out. Wish me luck!
