Need Advice for a 3rd Interview2014-02-25, 07:43 AMFirst off, I've been unemployed for many months now. I've had 2 interviews with a VP who would be my boss, and now he's asked me to come and do an interview with the HR Manager. The first two interviews went well, but not great (I feel if they would have went great, I would have been hired by now). On a personal level, I felt that we really connected because we're both prior military and we traded some "war stories." My first interview in this matter was over 2 1/2 months ago. At our second interview about 5 weeks ago, he indicated that I may not be a perfect fit for the job, and he obviously was and/or is still searching for the "perfect" candidate.The field is construction/planning/technical/building services.So, what should I expect from the HR manager? This interview seems out of place too, because aren't HR interviews usually done first, instead of last? I don't think I've ever had an interview with HR (to get a job). Is there something I should specifically prepare for?ÊThanks for your help.
