There is a guy living here at partial care who is completely obsessed in love with a woman who doesn't feel the same. It's kind of sad seeing him torture himself with these obsessive thoughts. It's also pretty annoying because she's all he ever talks about.I've had obsessive thoughts many times, even some where I had convinced myself that someone loved me who didn't. Do you guys have any experience with this? How should I advise this guy? For me those thoughts just went away, how can I help this guy?
