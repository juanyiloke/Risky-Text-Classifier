lung cancer spread to my brain and i am not the same man as i use to bei have had no treatment as i dont see any point in it the worse part of the cancer for me is in my head..its in the frountal lobe of my brain and is causing me so many problems with the way i act..people tell me i am saying out of the way things to them and as they put it going out of my head doing things i would never do other wise..i would like to know at what point should i maybe go somewhere that is safe for everyone involved because some of the things i do and say are just not right and i dont feel confortable being around people if these things are going to keep going on or get worse(not exactly wanting to say what they are but some are sexual and some are getting to a violent point) my temper is out of control at times i have headaches so bad i can not function i have seizures already and this is making those worse i dont know what i am doing or what i should do this is the first time i have tried to talk to anyone other then my gf about the cancer
