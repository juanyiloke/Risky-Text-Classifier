Wheezing has gradually gone away but now trouble breathing?________________________________________So, I had bad wheezing after a cold from last winter. A regular doc prescribed me Symbicort. I had been taken it regularly, but recently my wheezing went away, so I stopped taking the Symbicort just to see what would happen with my wheezing. The wheezing has gradually died down, but now I have trouble breathing at certain times during the day especially at night around 8 o'clock and on. I can't tell if the wheezing going away is a good thing or a bad thing. Also, sometimes, I also feel a murmuring sensation in my upper chest when inhaling. The biggest thing is when I inhale I don't feel like I'm getting enough air. I want to go to a pulmonologist, but it looks like it might be a while before I'll get in. I have a few doses left of my Symbicort and want to save them. I'm uncomfortable going to sleep and I'm also nervous about things like the "silent chest" since my wheezing has really died down. It's also really humid where I am right now, so I don't know if that's factoring into my trouble breathing. Lastly, I also have had panic attacks in the past, so I'm always hesitant to go to the doctor over things like feeling like I'm not getting enough air. How can I tell the difference between a panic attack and asthma?Do you think it's asthma? Why does it seem to happen from 8 o'clock at night and up? What can I do so I can sleep? (-.-)Thank you.
