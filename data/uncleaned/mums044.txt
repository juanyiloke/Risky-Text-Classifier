DS is 13 months old and appears to have had a personality transplant as he's become such a monkey His latest one is that he won't stop throwing things. He will pick up a toy and throw it across the room and at meal times he will repeatedly pick food off his tray and throw it over the side of the high chair. The throwing of the toys has been escalating and today he threw a toy brick in my direction and it hit me in the face. Whenever he throws something I always give him a stern 'no' but then he will pick up another toy and then throw that one. He looks at me in such a way when he does it that I know he's testing me. This morning, after the brick hit my face, I decided that something had to be done so every time he threw a toy I gave my stern 'no' and then pick the toy up and put it on top of the wall unit and so far there are five toys up there. He has a few seconds of being hysterical when I put his toy up there but I can't let him carry on throwing things. Is this too harsh at his age?Story time before bed has also become difficult as whereas he used to sit nicely on my lap for his two stories he now constantly tries to stop me turning pages, he hits the book, he tries, to rip the book out my hands and surprise, surprise he tries to throw it. I have taken the stance that if he behaves like this then he doesn't get the story and so I stop halfway through, put the book back on the bookcase and then start on his second story. If he starts with the same behaviour during the second book then I stop reading that one too. This morning, prior to his nap, he was carrying out this behaviours on both stories so he was put into his cot without either book being read.I don't know what's normal behaviour or what I should allow him to do because 'that's what babies his age do' and in what circumstances do I need to be firm and take action to try and make him see his behaviour isn't acceptable. Does anyone have any advice?
