Manchester or Aberdeen uni?by ViktorsSGood afternoon, everyone!I am a student from Latvia who is going to study in the UK next school year and I have to make a very important decision soon - choosing my firm and insurance university by 4th May. I decided to study Petroleum engineering. I have already passed my IELTS exam (7.5 overall) and I have excellent marks at school as well. So now there are two universities which I like the most - Manchester and Aberdeen and I really do not know what to choose Firm one.On one hand, Aberdeen is a good university itself: good rank, close to North sea where the practise is available I guess. But the weather is... not so suitable for me. And the accommodation is more expensive I guess.On the other hand, Manchester university is good also. Furthermore, the city is bigger so I can meet different people from all over the world (=new acquintaces= new opportunities). Moreover, my friend who I have known for 12 years is also studying Petroleum engineering at foundation year there. However, he did not get an appropriate IELTS band thus he reccomends me to go to Aberdeen.In brief, I am choosing between a good education (hmm...) and relative and friendly atmosphere. Could you please give me some advice about my situation and maybe share with your experience if you have some.  Thank you very much in advance!
