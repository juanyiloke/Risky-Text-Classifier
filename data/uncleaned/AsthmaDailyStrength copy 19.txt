So I went to my trusty pulmonologist this morning for my checkup. Things had been going pretty good (partially, I think, as I was stuck in my nice, clean, filtered air at home this summer as I recuperated from a major foot surgery..which also meant no weightbearing/exertion...). So I expected a pat on the back and refills of my meds. Got that...but also orders to go get a cardiac echo (I've had several over the years, as I had rheumatic fever as a kid, and things have always been a bit wonky in my heart) because he's now looking at the possibility of pulmonary hypertension on top of the asthma and tachycardia. Ugh. Don't really want to deal with yet ANOTHER potential lung/heart issue, and also just want to be cleared for the surgery on my other foot, which is currently scheduled for Nov 19...then I can get recovery OVER WITH and get back to real life...maybe. Just a vent, mostly. Anybody else have pulmonary hypertension and asthma? Know anything about it? Bleck.
