need advice please?:s________________________________________Hello. I've been having dyspnea for almost three years now, but only was diagnosed with asthma two months ago. I was one month on Symbicort, two times every day, and I haven't noticed much improvement. I mean yeah, it's a bit better than before, but I'm still not quite functional. For the past year my breathing's been really bad (got max 70% at the spirometry), so maybe it takes a while longer to improve...? I'm really new to this and I have no idea. Is it a problem if I haven't improved much after one month or should I just be patient?Also,I'm allergic to mold and I'm wondering whether the fact that I live above a basement could have negative effects. The house is clean, no mold at all. Is it a problem, can it extend its influence or something from thebasement even if the house is okay? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I really have no idea.And a last question... is it impossible for any of you guys to sneeze? I have periods of time when I simply can't have enough air to sneeze, when I'm supposed to take that deep breath in it just stops halfway. Is it something that happens with asthma?Thank you
