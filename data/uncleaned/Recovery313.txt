Trying to recoverHi everyone, I am new to the forum, and am trying to get better. I didn't anticipate quite how hard that would be. Today is a better day in that I am able to write this message on the board, but i know tomorrow could be a completely different story. It's the fear of the bad days that sometimes feeds into my depression. Friends have been so supportive, but they don't understand the extent of how I feel and it's really difficult to explain.I guess I'm just here for re-assurance, and to know that i'm not the only one suffering like this. I've also started a blog (so far it only has 1 post..!) to try and put my thoughts and feelings into some kind of sense whilst I am recovering. I would appreciate it if people wouldn't mind giving it a read and posting some feedback. >> http://lifeandothermusings2014.blogspot.co.ukStay Strong, Kelly
