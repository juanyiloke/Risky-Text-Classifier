Want To Die Ive Lost EverythingSamLets start by saying a 26 yr old with 2 kids i never am allowed to see due to the mothers having a grudge against me……then i find the love of my life and get brought out of a slump and start to feel better and start to actually leave my house and become a somewhat normal person. Her sons dads been around and she has been between us both for the last idk how long so when i found that out it hurt me bad. Months later due to her and her drug addiction she says that is what drove her to cheat on me for a month and a half straight again because i love her and she means the world to me i try and forgive and forget about it as much as i can. she then says can my sons dad stay her for a few days he has no where to go ik ik im the dumbass for saying yes but she is so manipulative in saying if you truly loved me you would want to help my sons dad as much as we can. so he comes to stay and i wake up one night from our bed to see her in the blankets with him so i become angry and hurt again more then the last time and it all adds up. ik i did wrong out of frustration i had talk to someone when i thought we were over well in her mind we never were thought to be over. so my anger from being cheated on multiple times caused me to ask someone a stupid question over the course of a few days nothing happened nor would have everytime after i said it i wanted to punch myself out for being so stupid and letting my anger get to me so much that i just wanted to see her hurt as much as i was. well after all of this she decides to keep saying im worthless due to words that shouldnt have been said i feel as if I this is just gods way of telling me my time on this earth is over and that i should just end it and everyone will be better off without me i mean i dont get to see my kids ever i have nothing now nothing but a heart that is black and dead inside and a soul that is probably as black if not blacker. Im sitting here staring at a bottle of percocet and want to just eat them all then hang myself i cant go on like this anymore its just not worth the pain and hurt.
