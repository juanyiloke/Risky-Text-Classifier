On the way, but could really need some inputs/help!!HiFirst, I am 26 years old. My ED symtomps started 7 years ago. After a year or two with eating around my resting metabolic rate, I started slowly increasing.it has been a long journey with semi recovery. Eating more, but until last October I had not put on any weight. for the last few years, I have no had that much bloating, but it came and went in periods. I was not able to identify any pattern other that more in periods when I was sitting more (office worker) compared to holidays or days when I walked/moved more around.I am very active both non-exercise related activity and regularly cycling to work. After being in a state of eating more normal. I decided last October that something had to be done. I have a wife who was tired of the extreme focus on food and thoughts around food and exercise. I also have 2 small kids that should have a more healthy dad.Since last October I have steadily gained a bit. So for my question really. Are there anyone else out there who are on the way to recovery and that experiences slight water retention regularly in their feet and abdomen?How long can I expect this to last?I can't really see that it is normal for a 26 year old male to get fluid retention in feet and abdomen. Also after sitting for a while at work. I have done all kind of blood tests, blood pressure etc. nothing appears to be wrong. I do have a fairly low resting pulse (40 - ish just before sleeping).Hope someone can give me some input. It really affects my progress further! It would be a relief if anyone else are experiencing similar behavior.Cheers!
