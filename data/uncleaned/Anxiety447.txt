Girls :: Advice PleaseSo my past two periods have been EARLY. I just had my period on April 12 and now 18 days later it has started on April 30th....... Is this normal? I have been fairly regular my whole life. I am a 25 almost 26yr old female with no prior obgyn issues. I have been on and off the pill since I was 17 but it has been a good 3-4years since I have taken it. I did TRY the pill again about 6 or so months ago but got really bad side effects, I threw up the first night and then my breasts felt like they were on fire for about a week. So i stopped it and my periods went back to normal. I have sever anxiety around a week before my period and also sever IBS flares where I often confuse my IBS for cramps.  I was diagnosed with GAD/Panic about 2 years ago. I did not have issues with my period when I was at my WORST.. I am a lot better now, still tense all the time and still on my zoloft/kilonopins but better. My worst fear is the thought of something being wrong, like I can't have kids or something. I see my OBGYN every year, had 1 abnormal pap (3 years ago) but have been fine ever since. Should I be concerned? Im use to being normal but i know irregular periods in your 20s can be a common complaint... Im about to be 26 I don't feel like my periods should all the sudden be coming early now.  I called my OBGYN and left a message for the nurse to call me back. I hate this / being a girl.
